Thanks for the response.  Our next dinner is scheduled for September 25, at
the moment I'm not sure who the other invitees would be.  Jerry would
probably have a better idea as he puts together the guest list for each
event and may already have something in mind.  That's actually another
reason why I think we should leave the call tomorrow on the calendar.
Depending on Mr. Skillings availability/interest Jerry might want to
reconfigure his invitee list for the most appropriate mix of people.

Erica, thanks for the note.  Joannie has left the office for the day, but
will return tomorrow morning.

In the meantime, I'll run this by Jeff to see if he thinks it makes sense.
Do you have any dates for future dinners in mind?  The vast majority of
Jeff's time is committed through February 2002, so knowing what the
dates/timeframes are would be most helpful in the event we need to try to
free up some time.  Thank you.

Probably the best thing is for the call to go ahead, that way Jerry can
brief Mr. Skilling on our plans for the remaining dinners throughout the
year and Mr. Skilling can decide on the best one for him to attend.

Does that sound feasible to you?

  <content type="text" name="message">POWER POINTS: Skilling Moves On To Charities, Family
   By Mark Golden
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Jeff Skilling will be spending the next few years
working with charities in Houston and spending time with family, the former
chief executive of Enron Corp. (ENE) said in an interview.
  The 47-year-old Skilling, who resigned abruptly from Enron after the
company's
board meeting Aug. 14, repeatedly said he had left - as stated - for
personal
reasons. Wall Street has been skeptical of the explanation, and several
analysts
have said they're waiting for "the other shoe to drop." The company's stock
price fell 14% in response to the announcement last week - a loss of about
$4.5
billion in shareholder value - and hasn't recovered this week.
  But the former chief executive said the stock price will recover once
investors see that his departure isn't a precursor to more bad news for the
company.
  "I've spent the last 34 years working really hard," said Skilling, who
requested the interview with Dow Jones Newswires. "There are a lot of things
that I haven't been doing - personal interests, spending time with family.
There
are a number of charitable things that I haven't spent the time on that I
believe I should. I don't mean fundraising, but hands on, getting out and
doing
things, building houses, helping individuals."
  Skilling, who has been involved with a multiple sclerosis charity for
years,
said he plans to get involved in promoting the City of Houston.
  "It's massively underrated as a place to work and live," he said. "It's a
great city, and I think I can do a lot to get that across."
  Though insistent that there is nothing more to his departure than personal
reasons, Skilling said little to reveal why a talented executive would
surrender
the top spot of the country's largest energy trading company just six months
after taking the job. Skilling had been Enron's No. 2 executive from 1997
until
this year, and he's generally credited with the success of Enron's wholesale
trading operations, which comprise about 80% of the parent's earnings.
  He confirmed there's no crisis in his family, and his health is fine.
Skilling, who assumed the chief executive title on Feb. 12, also denied that
he
was suffering under the strain of the job.
  Late last week, Chairman Kenneth Lay and other Enron executives in New
York
told Wall Street analysts that Skilling had been going "kind of nuts" under
the
pressure of being chief executive, one analyst said.
  "It's not true that I was cracking up," he said. "Do I sound like someone
who
is cracking up? The representation of me as thick-skinned is a reasonable
representation."
  When asked if his departure could have been handled more smoothly so as
not to
alarm investors, Skilling said that perhaps the mechanics could have been
better, but said that is hindsight.
  "We thought it through and thought we were going about it in the right
way,"
he said. "I don't know what we could have done differently. It will turn
out, in
retrospect, fine, as soon as people see that there's nothing else."

   About One Week's Notice

  The former chief executive totally disagreed with speculation in this
column
last week that Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay, who immediately resumed the role
of
chief executive, may have wanted to regain day-to-day control of the company
and
pushed Skilling out.
  "I think the world of Ken. You can't find a bigger fan of his than me," he
said. "I was not forced out. Personal and family reasons are 100% of the
story.
I guess it's kind of mundane, and I'm sorry it doesn't have as much drama
and
suspense as a lot of people would like it to have, but that's what the deal
is."
  Skilling said he spoke with Lay about wanting to do other things many
times
over the years. The first serious discussion of his imminent departure came
about a week before the announcement, said Skilling, whose recollection of
his
giving notice to Lay was somewhat cloudy.
  "The board knew what was going on, and that was the point (the Aug. 14
board
meeting) where the decisions were going to be made," he said.
  The decisions?
  "I guess to accept my resignation," Skilling said.
  Enron refused to release a copy of the minutes of the Aug. 14 board
meeting,
which was regularly scheduled. The company doesn't generally release
board-meeting minutes, spokeswoman Karen Denne said.
  The former chief executive continues to work as a paid adviser to Enron. A
clause in his contract prevents him from competing with the company through
the
end of 2003, and he has no plans to work outside the energy industry.
  That might sound like a big comedown from running the country's most
aggressive energy company, but Skilling said the move fits.
  "Some people say 'Well, you were working and aspiring so long to become
CEO of
Enron.' That's not true. I was working to build a business, and we did,"
said
Skilling, who is credited with transforming the company into a trading
powerhouse.
  "The company I built is doing great. My life is moving on."
  He also said the company will do fine without him. Some analysts have
expressed concern about Enron's ability to retain its top talent. Skilling's
predecessor as Enron's No. 2 executive, Richard Kinder, for example, left
the
company in 1996 after Lay announced that he would be retaining the chief
executive spot for another five years. Kinder went on to buy Enron's small
liquids pipeline business and turned that company into Kinder-Morgan Inc.
(KMI).
  Enron's current management, Skilling said, has a "very deep bench." For
example, he described Enron Energy Services Chief Executive Dave Delaney as
"awesome."
  "Dave created the Canadian business in Enron," Skilling said.

Enron's Power Crisis

"Bizarre" is how everyone describes it. On Aug. 14, Enron CEO Jeff Skilling--a self-described "brilliant" 47-year-old who says he's never suffered any kind of failure--announced he was relinquishing his title and leaving the company after a mere six months in the top job. Skilling insisted that the parting was voluntary, laying the blame on unspecified personal, non-health-related reasons. But by leaving when and how he did, Skilling forfeited a roughly $20 million severance package and gained the responsibility of repaying a $2 million loan that Enron would have forgiven had he stuck around until the end of the year. 
More bizarre than his timing is how quickly Enron's once tight relationship with Wall Street deteriorated during Skilling's reign. The ex-CEO was famously boastful--insisting that Enron's nascent broadband trading business was worth $35 billion--and thin-skinned, declaring on a conference call that a money manager who dared ask for a balance sheet was an "asshole."
The task of restoring Enron's glory falls to Ken Lay, the company's chairman and former CEO, who has replaced Skilling. He's got his work cut out. Enron's "overall quality of earnings has deteriorated, its level of behind-the-scenes financial engineering has increased, and its overall standing with the Street has plunged," wrote UBS Warburg analyst Ron Barone in a recent report--and Barone is one of the bulls. Despite Lay's insistence that there aren't any "accounting issues, trading issues, or reserve issues" at Enron, investors are hesitant to bid the company back up. Indeed, Enron now trades at around $38, down some 60% from its 52-week high. 
One reason Lay's job is so tough is that, as FORTUNE pointed out in March (see "Is Enron Overpriced?" on fortune.com), Enron's financials are on the dim side of opaque. While Wall Street was once willing to take the company's word on financial performance, it no longer is. And because Enron gives analysts so little to work with, building independent models is next to impossible. Enron's major business, the trading and marketing of energy, is relatively new and extremely complicated. Seemingly basic questions--like the effects of lower natural gas prices and less volatility in the energy markets on Enron's profits--are still unanswered. And there's confusion about the relationship between Enron's reported earnings, which reflect changes in the value of its energy-trading portfolio, and the actual cash coming in. In the first half of the year, Enron reported net income of $810 million and cash flow from operations of negative $1.3 billion. 
Then there's the challenge of convincing investors that Enron itself believes it has a rosy future. High-level executives besides Skilling have recently left, and analysts like Jeff Dietert at Simmons say insider selling has been "aggressive" recently. While Enron executives still hold big chunks of stock, according to Thomson Financial/Lancer Analytics, insiders have sold 1.75 million shares in 2001--and they've sold as the stock has fallen, which is generally regarded as a bad sign. Among the biggest sellers: Lay, who has sold 408,000 shares at prices ranging from $81 last winter to $43 in July. Other sellers have included two executives who have since resigned: new business unit head Lou Pai and broadband chief Kenneth Rice. Enron says that sales are related to the pending expiration of options. 
Lay is moving swiftly to address those concerns. He's promised the Street more disclosure about Enron's operations, and to combat criticism about Enron's weak bench he recently announced a new office of the chairman, anointing veterans Greg Whalley and Mark Frevert to help him run the company. No word yet on whether he plans to start buying Enron stock. 
Quote: Wall Street will no longer take the company's word on financial performance.

Enron Offers to Complete Indian Power Plant If Govt Backs Sale

Enron Offers to Complete Indian Power Plant If Govt Backs Sale

     Mumbai, Sept. 6 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. said it will
finish building a $3 billion power plant in India if the
government backs a plan by the biggest energy trader to sell its
majority stake in the unprofitable venture to local banks.

     Work stopped in June on the second construction phase of the
power station in Maharashtra state because the plant's sole
customer, the state electricity board, owes $64 million in unpaid
bills and ceased buying power in May. The expansion, which is 95
percent complete, would add 1,444 megawatts of capacity.

     Enron offered to sell its 65 percent stake in Dabhol Power
Co., the plant's owner, in three tranches to local banks that
helped finance the project, Business Standard reported, citing a
letter to India's Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee from Enron.

     ``We are willing to complete the project at cost should they
(government) proceed with our plan,'' said Jimmy Mogal, a
spokesman for Dabhol Power Co., Enron's local unit.

     Enron would sell 40 percent of its shares in Dabhol once
negotiations with construction operators to finish the work begin.
It would sell a further 50 percent of its stake once construction
restarts in April 2002. The rest would be sold when the project is
completed by January 2003, the paper said.

     Contractors stopped work on the expansion in June because
they hadn't been paid since April.

    Indian banks loaned $1.4 billion to Dabhol without government
guarantees on the loans. The $600 million lent by ABN Amro, Bank
of America Corp. and other overseas banks is covered by government
guarantees.

     Indian lenders would have to disburse about $320 million for
completion of project, which includes construction of a 5 million-
ton liquefied natural gas import and storage facility.



INDIA PRESS: Enron Proposes 3-Stage Sale Of Dabhol Stake

09/06/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) is proposing to sell the foreign equity in India's Dabhol Power Co. to Indian financial institutions through a three-part payment structure extending until Jan. 1, 2003, reports the Business Standard. 
Enron holds a 65.86% stake in DPC, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, or MSEB, holds 14.14%, and Bechtel Corp. (X.BTL) and General Electric Co. (GE) each hold 10%.
Dabhol is a 2,184-megawatt power project in the western Indian state of Mahrashtra. 
Enron wants to sell its equity in DPC following payment disputes with its sole buyer, MSEB, and the federal government's failure to honor its counterguarantee. 
DPC's 1,444-megawatt phase II is about 95% complete. Its construction was abandoned by the contractor because of DPC's inability to pay. 
Under the structure, Enron has asked for initial payment of 40% of the purchase price of the entire foreign equity at the start of renegotiations between potential buyers and construction operators. 
The second installment of 50% has to be paid at the resumption of construction of the second phase of the project, or by April 1, 2002, whichever is earlier. The third and final installment of 10% has to be paid at the time of mechanical completion of the 2,144-MW power plant and regassification facility, or by Jan. 1, 2003, whichever is earlier, the report says. 
In a proposal submitted to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Enron has said in the event the federal government doesn't directly purchase the foreign equity, it should guarantee the payment obligation in full. 
The $2.9 billion Dabhol project has an equity component of $1 billion, with foreign players, including Enron, contributing $858.6 million. India's financial institutions have a total exposure of over 60 billion rupees ($1=INR47.16), the report says. 
The Indian financial institutions, currently preparing a plan for the project's early revival, are considering Enron's proposal, the report said.

More companies looking to hedge their exposure to volatile energy prices
By BRAD FOSS
AP Business Writer

ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - Harrah's Entertainment Inc. is willing to bet on many things. The cost of energy isn't one of them. 
Stung by high electricity and natural gas prices last year, Harrah's is not taking any more chances when it comes to buying the power to keep its casino on the New Jersey shore as bright and noisy as the nearby boardwalk and as cool as an Atlantic breeze.
The company has since locked in long-term supply contracts at fixed prices with Houston-based Enron Corp., joining the growing legion of hotels, manufacturers, retailers and technology firms behaving more like utilities in terms of hedging their exposure to volatile energy prices. 
In January, Harrah's Atlantic City - 86,000 square feet of casino space and more than 1,100 hotel rooms - rang up a natural gas bill that topped $220,000, nearly quadruple what it normally pays during a winter month. 
Under the 7-year deal with Enron, Harrah's agreed to pay roughly $5 per 1,000 cubic feet for a certain amount of natural gas. 
"We wanted to put ourselves in a position where we could even the playing field and not worry about those price spikes," said Stuart Thomas, who oversees energy procurement at Harrah's. 
Last winter, the retail price soared above $10 per 1,000 cubic feet in many parts of the country, and as high as $19 per 1,000 cubic feet in New Jersey. 
At $5 per 1,000 cubic feet, Harrah's natural gas bill last January would have been closer to $60,000. 
While Harrah's will be buffered from the worst-case scenario next January, the company could miss out on some savings if natural gas prices dip below what they've agreed to pay Enron. Harrah's executives said that is a tradeoff they will accept. 
"We didn't do it to save money," said Thomas, emphasizing that Harrah's $40 million-a-year energy bill is a tiny fraction of its overall costs. "We did it to manage risk." 
Harrah's is not alone. Eli Lilly & Co., IBM Corp., Kraft Foods Inc., Saks Inc. and Solvay Polymers Inc. are just some of the companies that have energy management deals with Enron, Duke Energy Corp. and Reliant Resources Inc. 
Enron's energy services unit is head and shoulders above its closest rival in this emerging field, signing $40 billion in contracts since it was created in 1997. After $200 million in losses since 1998, it recorded its first profits of $100 million in profit in the first half of 2001. 
Jeremy Blachman, the division's chief operating officer, attributes the success to the breadth of its portfolio, which includes deals with food and beverage giant Quaker Oats Co. and the Archdiocese of Chicago, which signed a seven-year agreement worth nearly $250 million. 
"Over the last couple of years, and particularly the last 6 to 9 months, we have seen our business go across markets," Blachman said. 
A.G. Edwards & Sons analyst Mike Heim said Enron's energy services unit, which is essentially a seller of electricity and natural gas at retail prices, remains but "a blip" within Enron, which gets 80 percent of its profit from wholesale marketing and trading. 
But if power and natural gas prices remain volatile, "it has the potential to become 10 to 20 percent of their business down the line," Heim said. 
Makers of chemicals, fertilizer, glass and steel - some of the most energy-intensive industries in the United States - were hit the hardest in the past 18 months as natural gas and electricity soared to prices never seen before. 
Companies that were not protected with long-term contracts took it in the neck, said P.J. Juvekar, a senior chemicals analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. 
After Dow Chemical Co., which was protected, completed its purchase of Union Carbide Corp., which wasn't, Dow was hit with a first-quarter loss of $685 million, compared with a profit of $512 million a year earlier. 
"Most of the disappointment came from the Carbide side, where they were fully exposed to $10 (per 1,000 cubic feet) natural gas prices without any hedges," Juvekar said. 
Companies that were protected from last year's energy spikes recognized earlier on that "we didn't feel as comfortable as the market deregulated," said Michael Thaman, chief financial officer of fiberglass giant Owens Corning, which needs massive quantities of natural gas and electricity to melt billions of pounds of glass each year. 
"We certainly don't have any illusions about our ability to beat the market," said Thaman, whose company signed a 10-year contract with Enron worth $1 billion. 
In the case of Harrah's, the most important thing was to rein in energy costs without skimping on amenities at the casino or hotel, said Bill Simpson, facilities manager at the Atlantic City property. 
Shutting down unused slot machines - 3,500 are on at all times - or adjusting the casino floor thermostat - set at a constant 70 degrees - were never considered last winter even as natural gas and electricity prices soared to record levels. Neither was passing along the costs to hotel guests by adding an energy surcharge on their bills, a strategy pursued by many hotel companies.

Enron still plans sale of Portland General
NEW YORK -- Enron Corp. said Wednesday it still plans to sell its Portland General utility in Oregon. 
Enron has been trying to sell the utility for more than a year. A $3.1 billion sale to Sierra Pacific Resources collapsed in April because the California power crisis made it too difficult to win approval, the companies had said. 
Enron is "getting close to another transaction" involving Portland General, Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said at a Lehman Bros. energy conference in New York. 


Power regulators still debating decisions on key energy issues

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - State power regulators were poised Thursday to suspend direct access, the option that allows Californians to choose their electricity provider. 
Though a mere 200,000 Californians switched from their local utility to companies such as Green Mountain Energy or Enron, the Legislature has ordered the Public Utilities Commission to temporarily end consumer choice to keep three struggling utilities from losing more customers.
Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison Co. and San Diego Gas and Electric Co. are each are on the hook for the more than $9.5 billion the state spent buying electricity on their customers' behalf this year. 
The PUC is expected to suspend direct access retroactively to July 1. Energy service providers, such as solar and wind-powered electricity seller Green Mountain Energy, say it's unconstitutional, and have vowed to fight the PUC in court. 
Likely to be missing from Thursday's meeting are several key issues that would affect Californians' electric bills: 
- A proposal to grant the state's power-buying agency the authority to raise electric rates on its own without PUC review to ensure such rates are justified. 
- A proposal to raise rates for San Diego Gas and Electric Co. residential customers by an average of 12 percent. 
- A proposal that bills Pacific Gas and Electric Co. $6.5 billion, Southern California Edison Co. $4 billion and SDG&E $1.5 billion to help the state recoup its power-buying costs. 
PUC President Loretta Lynch said the commission needs more time to review a flood of comments from utilities, consumer advocates and other parties to those decisions. 
The state plans to recover some of the money it has spent buying power by collecting a portion of ratepayer money. 
The more ratepayers each utility has, the lighter the blow to each customer's electric bill. But it would come at the expense of consumer choice, which lawmakers had promoted as the method by which deregulation would foster competition and lead to lower electric rates. 
Rick Counihan, vice president and general manager of Green Mountain Energy, said if the PUC suspends consumer choice until the state stops buying power for the utilities - potentially a decade down the road - consumer choice is dead. 
"(Direct access) was one of the few good things that came out of the restructuring," Counihan said. 
Just as some environmentally conscious customers buy organic produce or recycled paper products, the option to leave their utility and buy power largely generated by the wind or sun was another way they could make a difference, he said. 
Under the PUC plan, customers who signed up with an energy provider before July 1 could keep their contracts until they expire. Deals signed after that date would be nullified, and the customer would be forced to return to a local utility. 
PUC Commissioner Richard Bilas, a vocal proponent of direct access, is hopeful it could resume after the finances of PG&E, Edison and SDG&E improve. 
"When the utilities get back in the business - if they ever get back in the business of going out and buying electricity on behalf of themselves - that could open up direct access again," Bilas said. He predicted that could happen 18 months from now. 
Counihan was less optimistic. 
"I'm very skeptical that we, or other providers, will come back to California," Counihan said. "We'll very likely take our marketing activities and reallocate to other states that are more friendly." 
Counihan also worried a temporary suspension would give the big three utilities no incentive to retain an infrastructure of computers and other technology put into place to process customers who switched to the alternative energy firms.

I managed to work your explanation about why you went to San Francisco into this piece, and I'm glad you gave it because no one has heard your side of that story yet. And thanks for the Reuters plug during the conference call as well.
By the way, in listening to the tape of the interview, I realize I didn't explain why I thought the scene out there sounded like it was from a Stanley Kubrick movie. I heard there were folks in pig masks, and with the pie throwing, cops and cries of "Beat them!" it could have been an outtake from "A Clockwork Orange."
Anyway, thanks as always for your time and candor, the latter of which particularly makes covering Enron a real blast. And I want you to know that you have the single-best PR department I've ever run across. Karen, Mark, John and Vance deserve special mention for the number of phone calls they take from me, and for the expedition with which they respond. They always deliver the goods.
See you after the third quarter.

   HOUSTON, July 12 (Reuters) - The thus-far cool summer in California and the emergence of specifics about Enron Corp's &lt;ENE.N> limited involvement in the embattled California power market should ease pressure on the energy giant's stock, the company's chief executive said on Thursday.
   "I think we are going to get through the summer just fine. In terms of the financial impact on Enron, it's pretty much over," Enron President and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling told Reuters in an interview.
   The rhetorical attacks on the Houston company as an out-of-state generator ignore key facts about how much power Enron sold into California, he said.
   "I don't know how they can keep using us as the poster child when all of the numbers keep coming out. The poster child ought to be the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power," Skilling said.
   According to sales records maintained by the California Independent System Operator, which manages most of the state's power grid, Enron accounted for 0.4 percent of the alleged $9 billion in overcharges.
   The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is slated to decide if there was an overcharge to California, and if so, how much should be refunded.
   The same records show that the L.A. municipal utility and other municipal utilities in the state overcharged PG&amp;E Corp.'s &lt;PCG.N> Pacific Gas and Electric and Edison International's &lt;EIX.N> Southern California Edison utilities millions more than Enron did.
   "I believe ultimately in the longer term, as people become more knowledgeable about the data and statistics, I don't think they'll harp on Enron so much," Skilling said.
   Skilling has personally felt the nasty nature of the duel between California and "out-of-state power producers," the label California Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, has used to blast energy companies like Enron. During a June 21 speech in San Francisco, a demonstrator threw a cream pie and hit Skilling in the face.
   "I knew something was going to happen out there, but we  wanted to get our facts out and show our commitment to getting the facts out," Skilling said of the reason for his visit.
   After he was hit with the pie, Skilling calmly explained his and Enron's belief for the reasons behind California's power woes.
   While Davis blames Enron and others for jacking up wholesale energy prices, the companies pinpoint California's flawed deregulation scheme and a rise in the price for natural gas as the main problems.
   The latest manifestation of the flat-out war between California politicians and Enron is a California legislative committee's finding that Enron is in contempt for refusing to hand over confidential business documents in a probe into price gouging.
   The California Senate believes the finding gives them the power to fine Enron and possibly jail its senior officers.
   But just before the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation voted to hold Enron in contempt on Wednesday, the Houston company sued in a California court on a claim the legislature has no jurisdiction over them.

As I mentioned, Jerry is in transit in Europe at the moment, and it will be
extremely difficult for me to get hold of him again today to reschedule.
Given the time difference involved I will not be able to contact him before
the appointed time tomorrow, and therefore I'd very much appreciate if we
could go ahead with the call as planned.  At least that way Mr. Skilling can
decide which of the dinners he would prefer to attend, I assume that the
more notice you have the better.

Erica,

Due to the fact that Jeff is unable to attend on July 19, I believe it
would be better to reschedule the call for sometime next quarter.

Thanks,

Subject:  Telephone Call with Jerry Murdock


Dear Mr. Skilling:

I write on behalf of Jerry Murdock, who is currently in Europe.  Mr.
Murdock
asked me to pass on the following information regarding your telephone call
scheduled for 10:00am (CST) on Tuesday, May 15.

Insight Capital hosts a quarterly dinner with Robert Rubin and Steve
Friedman and other selected guests.  Our next dinner is scheduled for July
19 and will be held in Aspen, Colorado.  The Current State of the Global
Market will be one of the topics under discussion and Jack Welch of GE is
one of your fellow invitees.

The purpose of your conversation with Mr. Murdock is to discuss the above
in
more detail and to more fully brief you on the purpose of these dinners.

Please do not hesitate to contact me should you require any further
information.

Beta Brothers:

I, like many of you, enjoyed many a fatty on the Beta roof back in the
mid-1970s. But unlike Rocky Skilling, my hair did not fall out. It seems,
though, that I am few million short of the daring dynamo who now runs the
fucking world from Houston.

Many snaps for Brother Skilling. I still remember him throwing up in Arends'
shoes. But certainly, that doesn't preclude him from winning Beta's highest
honor.

I will be in Dallas the weekend of October 6 and would like to attend the
festivities if it doesn't conflict with the greatest football game on the
planet -- that, of course, being the contest down in the Cotton Bowl between
Bevo and the Mighty National Champs from Norman. You see boys, I am now a
full-blown Okie with a book to prove it. By the way, it's no longer
Texas-OU. It's now OU-Texas.

Now that we are on the subject, I am throwing an awesome bash in Norman at
the Sam Noble Museum on the evening of August 24 to unveil The Undefeated.
No, it's not about the Beta footballers of our junior season, but rather
that 47-game winning streak back in the fifties that made the Sooners world
famous. Berry, Benson, C-Di and Grumbles have confirmed. So that means we
will need bail money. Send lawyers, guns and money -- the shit has hit the
fan.

Let me know at jdent@mmcable.com or 405-858-0166.

Again, congrats to Brother Rocky, and get your butts to Oklahoma.

(By the way, Drow, you were slower than a dry creek, but you were Hutch's
favorite and that's why I never got the ball).

Brother Del Dent

Masa:

I enjoyed our evening together on the boat in Yokohama harbor very
much.  As promised, I have been in contact with Jeff Skilling at Enron.
He is interested in meeting with you.

I have been speaking with Jeff's assistant regarding appropriate dates
and mentioned the dates when you will be in New York in May.  I suggest
that your respective offices work together to settle the logistical
details.  Joannie Williamson will handle the arrangements for Jeff.
(e-mail: joannie.williamson@enron.com; phone: 713-345-7774)

I am sure you will have a very interesting conversation.

If I can help in any other way, please let me know.

Very best regards,

Ok, I'll tell you what I've told everyone else - the pledges Jeff has received range from $20 to $6000.  So, pledge with your heart, keeping your pocketbook in mind!  By the way, Jeff finished the ride in just over 14 hours!  SRS

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

Sherri :-)

Dear Mr. Morgan,

On behalf of Jeff Skilling, thank you very much for the invitation to
speak
to the San Diego Chapter of YPO.  Jeff was very flattered and somewhat
intrigued by your offer.  However, given the current demands on his
time,
he must respectfully decline your invitation.

Please let me know if you have any interest in another senior-level
representative of Enron speaking to your group, and I'll be happy to do
what I can to facilitate that for you.

Again, Mr. Morgan, thank you and the San Diego Chapter of YPO for the
the
opportunity.

Hi Jeff.

I am Mike's brother, Ronnie, living in San Diego and a member of the San
Diego Chapter of YPO.  With all the propaganda being spread about the
electricity and energy crisis we are experiencing here in California, I
thought it would be worthwhile to invite you to town to give us an
insider's view on what is really going on (aka, the "truth").  Is there
anyway you can find time in your busy schedule to visit us over dinner
with a short talk and a question and answer period.  The sooner the
better.

I will schedule a "special" meeting of our chapter to accommodate any
dates that work for you.

I look forward to hearing from you.

  <content name="title" action="cluster">Re: Chase Marc Shapiro call to Jeff Skilling</content>
  <content type="text" name="message">Angela, if in your view, the issues brought up by Chase are an underlying dissatisfaction with the "entire" agreement, particularily the commodity "savings and advice" component, perhaps it would be advantageous for both Enron and Chase to sit down and re-negotiate.  From our point of view, given the execution and contract issues we currently have with the contract, this may be a win-win for the companies.  Let's sit down and discuss strategy - if you think it would be advantageous, I will replace Tom as senior level contact.

As per my voice mail from this weekend, I would like to get ahead of the potential issues brewing at a number of the other accounts particularily Starwood.

Dag talked very briefly to  Manny prior to my getting your email--Dag will not talk to him again until you and Dag talk. 

Manny told Dag that Chase wants all the holes filled in their  year 2000 data base-- Manny seemed to be at  a a loss to explain in more detail exactly what is bothering Chase.

I agree with your perception that Chase feels they are not getting financial and construction value; they also feel there was other  value promised them -- such as , in Manny's words, " strategic commodity management" , i.e.,  insights into, and advice on,  how to respond to changes in the commodity market.

Subject:	Re: Chase Marc Shapiro call to Jeff Skilling   

I am requesting that Dag hold off on contacting Manny until Dag and I have met.  I know that we were scheduled to meet  on Tuesday to discuss these very issues but I can move this up to Monday morning.  

 Dag and Cindy have dramatically improved the quality of our billing efforts but the basic contract structure precludes us from ever achieving  customer satisfaction (perfection).    

 I really believe the underlying issue here is that Chase perceives they are not receiving the financial value they had anticipated from the commodity and construction agreements.  We presented a report to them last week that would support their position.  The lack of value created coupled with the  billing issues and a vacancy in senior sponsorship seems to have created the tension that ultimately could put us in a good position to re-negotiate this deal.

 We have identified several areas of contract restructure that will create immediate value for Chase and Enron, eliminate the billing issues and provide them the visibility into the financial performance of the agreement they have been requesting.  

Jeremy has a strong relationship with Mark Shapiro and should be leveraged here.  We need to make sure our response to Mark maximizes the opportunity to get everybody back to the table. 

I am going to the esource conference nex t week with Manny Patino, where he is presenting .  The main reason I am going is  damage control as many of our competitors  will be there and it is my intention to stay close to Manny. (a great heads up from Peggy).

Subject:	Chase Marc Shapiro call to Jeff Skilling

Jeff Skilling called me this afternoon to say that he received a call from Chase Vice Chairman Marc Shapiro. Shapiro said that Chase was upset about:

1. Tom White and Gary Provo no longer being involved with the Chase account

2. Billing errors (unspecified problems)

I explained to Jeff that:

1. Chase wants someone at the Tom White level to continue to be their senior contact; Jeff said that that Dave might want to perform that function

2. We have made major improvements with the billing but we have not reached perfection; perfection is what Chase wants.

Next Steps:

1. We will have to let Chase know who will be their Tom White level contact.

2. Dag Joraholmen will contact Manny Patino at Chase to get specifics on the billing issues and with Evan's team determine what can be done to address such specifics.

Mr. Awano,

Per your recent request to Dr. Kitatani, we have contacted Mr. Idei's Office to
find out his travel plans to the US in June.  Unfortunately, we were informed
that he is currently not scheduled to be out in the West Coast in June, and
therefore, will not be able to meet with Mr. Skilling at this time.

However, we were also informed by Mr. Idei's Office that he would be more than
happy to meet with Mr. Skilling during his next visit to Tokyo.  Therefore,
please keep us posted on any future travel plans to Tokyo that Mr. Skilling may
have so that we may assist you accordingly.

Thank you and should you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call.

Best regards,

Ann Rubin

  <content type="text" name="message">Hello, Jeff,

I know you must be quite busy with calls for interviews following your
recent announcement that you were leaving Enron. However, I'm hoping if you
have a moment today, you could provide 2 or 3 quotes about your decision
and where you're heading next for McKinsey &amp; Company's internal news Web
site, NewsNetwork, which has loyal readership across our Firm.  Our
upcoming deadline is tomorrow afternoon in time for our Monday, August 20
edition.  Given that we covered you once before on NN (see article below)
we believe this article would make for an important and worthy follow up.

I will take the liberty of calling you today to ensure you received this
message. Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.

Warm Regards,

Wylie Goodman
Managing Editor

------------------------------------------
Questions:

1. Can you elaborate more on the reason behind your decision to leave
Enron?
2. What are the most important accomplishments you feel you've achieved
during your tenure as CEO?
3. Do you have any immediate or mid-range plans for yourself personally or
professionally that you can share?
---------------------------------------------

Below is the first NewsNetwork article about your appointment to CEO:



Skilling named CEO at Enron
Dallas alum, longtime President and COO, elected CEO of the $80 billion
energy marketer.

Jeff Skilling (DA 1979-90) joined Enron in 1990, and became COO in 1996.
Under his leadership, Enron expanded its focus from natural gas pipelines
to become the largest gas and power marketer in the United States, as well
as diversifying into risk management and broadband capacity trading.
Kenneth Lay, Chair of Enron's board, told reporters, "Jeff is a big part of
Enron's success, and is clearly ready to lead the company."

Early in his tenure, Skilling helped the company exploit the newly
deregulated natural gas market by developing business models for efficient
trading and risk management. These became the template for the range of
commodity exchanges that now populate Enron's portfolio. McKinsey
contributed as well: Suzanne Nimocks (HO), the Enron co-DCS, says, "We've
worked very closely with Enron and Jeff on launching many of their new
businesses: gas trading, power trading, and pulp and paper."

After 11 years with the Firm, Skilling went to Enron well-versed in
McKinsey culture. According to Suzanne, "Jeff has done a really fine job of
leveraging the strengths of McKinsey and replicating them at Enron. Their
associate analyst program and their personnel review process are modeled on
McKinsey's. He's been able to extract those elements that make McKinsey
special and replicate them in a corporate setting."

Co-DCS Ron Hulme (DA) adds: "For those of us on the CST, it is sometimes
hard to tell whether we are at Enron or back at the office. The great news
is, with Jeff's distinctive leadership, it all works brilliantly."

Enron ranks #18 in the Fortune 500. With revenues topping $60 billion for
the first 9 months of this year, the company is on track to double 1999
results.

    Brother Skilling is at it yet again.  This time from the heartland at
old 3058 Yale.  As you can see, our chapter has decided to overlook Rocky's
many, many trips to the roof in the early 70's and bestow a Distinguished
Beta Award on his ass.  I would think that any compromising pictures one
might have of Brother Skilling would be extremely appropo for this occasion.
  I, for one, will be unable to attend due to the Redhead's and my 30th H.S.
reunion in Corpus on that day, but if you have anything young Adrew M Carty
could use, I'm certain he would appreciate.  He's also obviously the contact

Brother Berry,

Hopefully by now you've received my letter regarding the Distinguished Gamma
Omega Alumni Award.  If you haven't, the Gamma Omega Chapter is giving a
distinguished alumni award to Brother Jeff Skilling.  The event will take
place at the Melrose Hotel in Dallas on October 6th.
I got your email address from one of Mr. Skilling's secretaries.  I'd like
to make sure that every '75 Beta knows about this event and has the first
chance to attend, as the space we have is limited.
In addition, we are looking for any pictures of SMU life in 1975, with a
focus on Beta life and of course, Mr. Skilling.

If you can be of any help, that would be great.

You can reach me at this email address(acarty@mail.smu.edu), or at my home
telephone number: 214-369-6346.

Thanks,

___kai___

Andrew Carty
Beta Theta Pi Alumni Chair

  <content type="text" name="message">



Good morning Mr. Skilling.


When I arrive at work today the only e-mail I had was the EES Distribution, and my first though  
was great my day is going to go well. When I open and realised it was an opportunity to ask you a 
question, I though long and hard about it. The reasons being is that most of the little people in a company 
of this size never really get their voices heard on any issue,  and being a contractor make it even harder 
so why would this be any different. Another concern was,  will a person like yourself really have time in your 
busy schedule to read and answer every e-mail, phone call all or written correspondence he receives from an employee.
 But Mr Skilling I am taking the chance that you yourself  can hear this voice .

My question to you this morning is very important to me and I am quite sure to many others like myself.

I would like to know  why is it that Enron spend so much money, training and time on contractors like myself, only to turn around and hire someone
else to do the same job that the contractors are doing already. Wouldn't it be easier  and cheaper to offer the job to the contractor,
or just give them the opportunity to accept or decline the offer.?


Mr. Skilling I think that  Enron is a great company to work for because of all the information, that I have learned in my eight months of employment.
But like most company their is always room for improvements. Also Mr. Skilling this is not a pitch for employment, it just a question of concern.
Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you.

I wish that your day will be a great and less busy one. Have a great day.


Hope to hear from you soon.</content>

  <content type="text" name="message">Dear Jeff,
    Thought you'd be interested in seeing the wonderful e-mail response I
received from U.S. Air Force Major Ken Carey  regarding your plans to
address the Washington, D.C. AMS in November. It just arrived late last
evening. This is really above and beyond the call of duty given all that is
on your plate and I can't adequetely thank you for agreeing to do it. I
really passed this on to you with some misgivings, knowing how often I get
requests for talks for which there is just no time---and you're hit with
15,000 times the number of inquiries that pass this desk.  Thanks, again,
Jeff. You are certainly a hit in the meterological community and there is
much interest in what you have to say.  I get such a kick out of my brother!

     I continue to follow the whole California thing and all the news from
Enron via the various business news services.  I still chuckle when I think
of our hikes with Willy to the Watchung Mountains and the various forts and
treehouses we contructed along the way from rejected scrap wood picked up at
construction sites and contrast all that to the lives we lead today.  Who
would have thought??  You're doing a great job in a challenging environment
and I'm sorry to have added anything to an already busy work load with this.
But, I do thank you, Jeff!
     Preparations are underway for Mark and Sukran's visit in September.
Our Sue tells me she's very nice! Look forward to meeting her.
     Take care of yourself, Jeff!

       Love, Tom

Ken,
    I'm absolutely delighted to hear this! You are kind to share the news. I
know Jeff's incredibly busy but am thrilled at his plans to join you.  I'd
love to be there to hear his presentation myself.  I understand that what he
and his colleagues in Houston have done is really something and it should
make for an fascinating evening.  Adding Larry Heitkemper is a coup as well.
Much success with the program and congratulations on the effort you so
graciously put forth to put together a series of really outstanding programs
for the AMS Washington, D.C. chapter, Ken!
     Your kind invitation to visit one of your chapter meetings is noted and
appreciated. Things really hop here and I don't often get out that way.
But, I will definitely keep it in mind and can't thank you enough for the
offer.
     All the very best to you, Ken, and I do hope to see you again sometime
in the future! Have a great 2001-2002 season of meetings!

It looks like we have a tentative meeting with your brother Jeff as our
guest speaker on Friday, November 9th.  Thanks very much for helping us get
Jeff as our guest!  I sure didn't expect to get the Enron President and CEO!
In addition, Larry Heitkemper from Earth Satellite Corporation in Rockville,
Maryland, who works closely with Enron, has also agreed to be our guest.  It
should be an outstanding time had by all!

You'd better promise me that if you have any plans to come to Washington DC
that you let me know so we might have you over for dinner, or at least share
a cup of coffee.  We'd love for you to join us at a DC AMS Chapter meeting.

Take care, let's try to keep in touch, and I wish you very sincerely the
best of luck in your personal and professional endeavors.

Ken


Ken--
    How nice to hear from you and thanks for the picture! I do indeed
remember meeting you (sending the picture was a great idea and helped jog my
failing memory!).  Your words are very kind and I thank you sincerely.
    Let me put a call into my brother Jeff down at Enron and see if there
might be a way they can respond.  It's a fabulous idea for a talk and I know
that Jeff's group in Houston are extremely active in this area.  Will get
back to you with whatever information I can put together.
    Much success to you as well, Ken! It's interesting you've written today
for we've just received word here that one of my most recent interns, having
achieved his meteorological degree at Valparaiso University, has just
officially joined the Air Force, a lifelong ambition and dream come true.
Another of my former interns intends to do the same.
     All the very best, Ken!  I'll get back to you.

                   Tom

Hello from our Nation's Capital!  You and I met at the AMS Annual Meeting in
San Diego in 1999 (see attached picture of you and I!).  You're very well
known and I applaud all of the good things you're doing for both your
Chicago and national viewers, weather-wise, but, more importantly, your
tremendous and positive community involvement!

 &lt;&lt;Tom Skilling.bmp>>
As a chapter officer with the District of Columbia Chapter of the American
Meteorological Society (DC AMS), I want to get the very best speakers with
inspiring, entertaining, and thought-provoking topics for our chapter
membership.  I can't think of anything much more exciting in our profession
than that of weather derivatives, and the products and services for our
energy and agricultural sector that is a booming part of our field.

I'd like to get someone from Enron to speak at one of our chapter meetings.
I understand you may have an inside track to Enron and I wanted to inquire
if you could help us get an appropriate person to talk to our chapter about
weather for their business ventures.  I'd like to also get someone from the
weather provider perspectives, like a company like EarthSat Corp, so we
could get a better understanding of both the weather provider and customer
perspectives.

I look forward to hearing from you and best of luck with your future
professional and personal endeavors!

Best Regards,
Ken

Subject:	Endorsement Approval


Dear Ms. Patrick,

Thank you very much for providing an endorsement for Expectations Investing
by Al Rappaport and Michael Mauboussin. We really appreciate receiving Mr.
Skilling's thoughtful comments. We will plan to use the comments on the book
jacket, the front page, or in some cases, in other promotional materials.

Our manuscript editor has suggested the following edit to the comments for
style consistency with the rest of the work. Could you please review the
revised endorsement below and determine if it meets with your approval?

Also, please confirm the name and title as you wish them to appear with the
endorsement:

"Expectations Investing reinvents today's investment market architecture. .
. . A valuable tool for the innovative investor."

-Jeff Skilling, CEO, Enron Corp.


I would really appreciate it if you could please send me an email
(ekorey@hbsp.harvard.edu) or fax (617-783-7489) confirming your approval as
soon as you have reviewed the edited endorsement.  If I have not heard from
you by Monday, July 2, I will assume that the changes meet with your
approval.

Once again, many thanks for your support of Expectations Investing. I will
send you a copy of the finished book as soon as it becomes available.

Sincerely,
Erin

I enjoyed our evening together on the boat in Yokohama harbor very
much.  As promised, I have been in contact with Jeff Skilling at Enron.
He is interested in meeting with you.

I have been speaking with Jeff's assistant regarding appropriate dates
and mentioned the dates when you will be in New York in May.  I suggest
that your respective offices work together to settle the logistical
details.  Joannie Williamson will handle the arrangements for Jeff.
(e-mail: joannie.williamson@enron.com; phone: 713-345-7774)

I am sure you will have a very interesting conversation.

If I can help in any other way, please let me know.

Very best regards,

Ted

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

Sherri :-)

Mr. Kenneth Lay
Chairman
Enron Corporation
1440 Smith Street
Houston, Texas 77002

Dear Mr. Kenneth Lay:

This brief note concerns an innovative business development opportunity in
the rapidly expanding field of B2B eProcurement/e-commerce.  I am trying to
initiate a system to fully integrate an industry that is fragmented and in
need of adding scalable 'process' efficiencies.  This will require
substantial resources that are not available to me. These resources would be
less significant to a company like Enron Corporation.  However the upside
potential would, I believe, be significant to your corporation. The risk
reward ratio in this marketplace favors the upside potential significantly.
This market is ripe for innovation because of the fundamental need to
improve product and service delivery in a cost effective and timely manner.
The process has already begun but will require a critical mass player that
can deliver open-market eProcurement.  The process related savings alone
will be approximately $11 billion annual when an effective supply chain
system is implemented. The timing is critical since in the next 18- 36
months the winners and losers would have already lined up for success and
failure.  A linchpin is needed and it could well be Enron.  I have little
doubt that Enron could do the job and become the stand-alone leader in this
field.

I am writing to Enron Corporation to determine your potential interest in a
very large global marketplace that is poised for transformation and
transition.  This marketplace is currently valued in excess of $300 billion
annual worldwide with high profit margins as well as large continuing
revenue growth rates in excess of 10% annually. There are buy and sell side
opportunities for revenues as well as a transactional fee opportunity.

What I am proposing would be the critical next innovative step to enter a
new level of global sourcing, purchasing, risk management and distribution
for this industry.

I realize the vagueness and brevity of my comments but without an existing
level of confidentiality I cannot expand these thoughts.  If you have
interest in taking one additional step to determine if my strategic concept
has merit please let me know.

Best regards,

John Manfredonia

Gil,

Jeff asked me to let you know that he really appreciates this opportunity,
but his time in the office is at such a premium right now due to his heavy
travel schedule, it would be difficult at best to work them in.  He has
turned down several invitations to join boards because he just can't commit
the time.  So, while he is flattered by their interest, if and when Mr.
Quackenbush calls we will decline.

It was nice talking to you.  Glad to hear all is well.

Yours faithfully, Sherri ;-)

Jeff,

Great to see Enron and you doing so well.  Congratulations on the -belated-
CEO ship, the blowout first quarter,
and the recent piece in Bloomberg.

Since we last met Luminant has done a important and impactful work for
Enron
(EES, Enron Networks, Global
Sourcing, Broadband among others).  The Oasis and the Websource Intranet
sites are examples of the results of
this work.  Phillippe recently selected Luminant as one five integrators
that Enron will use going forward.

David Quackenbush, Luminants COO, has been personally involved in leading
the work at Enron.  He and
Jim Corey Luminant's CEO would like to have the opportunity of meeting with
you, bringing you up to date
on the work, and inviting you to consider joining the Luminant board.

I am no longer affiliated with Luminant but David asked me to let you know
of their interest.  He will be
following up and seeing if there will be an opportunity for you to meet
with
them.

Regards,

Gil Marmol

I met with Michael this afternoon, and we should schedule him for additional interviews.  I know that he has a schedule conflict next Wednesday, but is generally available starting the following week.  Let's get him into the next real-time interview round, or do a custom schedule if it goes out past a couple of weeks.

Thanks,

Jeff,

Judy Lay Allen, an associate of yours on the Federal Reserve board, spoke with Joannie Williamson today regarding my desire to interview at Enron.

I am a graduate of Princeton University with two years experience in financial modeling and communications.   Towards assessing my skill set relative to peers, I took and received a 740 on my GMAT.  I have also interned in a gas exploration company and am familiar with the industry; likewise, I have worked with clients in telecommunications and am aware of the work Enron is doing in the bandwidth trading/pooling field.

I am aware of Enron's executive training/business analyst programs and am highly interested in exploring opportunities therein.  I am in Houston through Friday evening and, given the short notice, would be grateful for any opportunity to meet with the appropriate person any time Thursday or Friday.

I look forward to interviewing and applying my experience at Enron.

Best regards,
Michael Kuntz

  <content type="text" name="message">Dear Tracy and Richard,

Here is Jeff Skilling's endorsement for Strategic Supremacy:

In Strategic Supremacy, Richard D'Aveni proves to be as thorough and accomplished an historian as business strategist.  Through intriguing parallels, D'Aveni demonstrates that now, as throughout history, anticipating, creating, interfacing and re-inventing markets, while managing risk, is the ticket to leading and succeeding.

Would you please email your fax number?  I can then forward to Richard some information that contains our most recent numbers.

Thanks!  Let me know if we can help in any other way.

Best Regards!

--Christie.

Dear Enron Employees:

I am saddened to inform you that there was an explosion and fire at our Teesside power facility in England at approximately 2:40 p.m. local time.  At this point, we know that two employees have died, and at least two others have been seriously injured. The area has been evacuated and the power station is currently off-line.  The cause of the incident is not yet known.  

Our hearts and deepest sympathies go out to the families of those affected by this terrible incident.

Jeff:

it was great to see Rebecca and you last night. I was sorry to hear about
your water damage, but thankfully it stayed out of the house. I am
attaching some stuff about the trip to Spain, that you might find useful.
You will find quite a bit of it in your Spain guide. Furthermore, I am
going to start thinking about a diving trip to the Caribbean in November.
You need to take about five days to make it worth while ( you can't dive on
the last day, on account of nitrogen levels in your blood stream). It will
be up to you to get certified in the meantime. The way I would do it (and
actually did) is to go to the Presidente Intercontinental in Cozumel and go
to their dive shop, Scuba Doo, for a three-day course.

I am scheduled to hear from the firm about my partnership election over the
next couple of days. I'll let you know what happens, one way or another. By
the way, I put your name on a list of references, so they might have
called. If they did, many thanks for taking the time and forgive me for not
telling you in advance.

All the best,

Pedro

Subject:	RE:  MS150

I am sure that you have forwarded this email to a more senior Michael Brown, however, I would be glad to pledge to Jeff's ride this weekend.  You see, last fall my daughter died of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), she was nine months old and if they find a cure for MS, the cure for SMA will not be far behind as they are similar diseases.

So I would like to pledge $500 towards the ride in honor of my daughter, Hayden.  All I ask is that when the ride gets really hard, to think of her &amp; all the others like her that will benefit from this ride, then pedal a little harder.

You can send someone to pick up my check as I am located @ EB 3108F.

Kevin, I got your message about not being available for dinner -  no
problem.  The other panelists were arriving too late also, so the dinner
was cancelled.

I just wanted to touch base and make sure you had everything thing you need
for tomorrow morning.  I'm attaching a map to the North Shepherd facility;
it's about 10 minutes outside of downtown.  I would be happy to make
arrangements for a sedan to pick you up if you like; just let me know from
where.

The event begins with a buffet breakfast at 7:30 a.m. and your panel will
begin at 8:45 a.m.  Jeff would like to meet with you, David Arnoff  and
John Thornton around 8:15 a.m. to cover any last minute items about the
panel.
I'll be at the North Shepherd facility beginning about 2:00 p.m. CDT today,
so you can reach me on my cell phone (713.854.1426).  Do not hesitate to
call me should you have any questions or need additional information as I
will not have access to e-mail after 2:00 p.m.

Regards, SRS

Dear Jeff,
 
Thank you for setting aside time to meet with me.  I have attached my resume to help bring you up to date on my career.  
 
As you will see, I have been providing advisory services since 1995.   During these years, I have done some of my best work.  I am proud of the service that I have rendered as an independent consultant.  
 
Now, I feel it is time to move to a new chapter in my career.  I look forward to sitting down with you to think through ways to apply my experience, intellect and energies to new professional challenges.  I respect you tremendously, and wherever the next part of my career may lie, I know that my search and choice will benefit significantly from your perspective.
 
Finally, I am attaching the recommendation to HBS that you wrote in 1981.  I found it during a profoundly challenging period in my life.  Your historic words of support helped me keep fighting and successfully moving forward.
 
If you would like to reach me before our meeting, please call (213) 926-2626 or email kevinscott@onlinemailbox.net .  Thank you again.
 
Sincerely,

Over the past few months, Enron Global Finance has been evaluating various opportunities where Enron and Smith Graham &amp; Company may be able to work together.  Unfortunately, the process was slowed when our primary contact at Smith Graham, Gabriel Hayes, left the firm earlier this year.  We have since reestablished discussions and the Global Finance Group is preparing a proposal that a portion (about $30 million) of the Enron Cash Balance Plan portfolio be dedicated to an emerging managers portfolio.  One-third of this money ($10 million) would be invested in bonds, which could be placed with Smith Graham, as the fixed-income manager .  (Total Plan assets are about $235 million.)

The proposal will be submitted to the Plan Administrative Committee at its quarterly meeting on May 3rd.  The proposal should be well received as the Committiee has previously requested that  we optimize our existing allocation to minority money managers.  Gerald Smith has been advised that Enron is looking at ways to allocate money to the firm, and that a decision should be reached sometime in May.  We have not communicated the specific details of our intentions as of yet pending the outcome of the May 3rd meeting.

I am available for further discussion at your convenience.

Regards,
Tim DeSpain

Jay,

I've always taken a pretty laid back approach to the noncompete when there is little overlap.  Having said that, however, I'd like to keep a "last veto" right - just give me a call when you've got something.

Good luck to you in the future, Jay.  You'll be missed at Enron.

Best regards,
Jeff

Subject:	My Resignation, and a Question

Jeff-

As you may know, I have (somewhat reluctantly) decided to resign from Enron.  For some time now, I have wanted to take some time off, and had asked Whalley about the possibility for a six month unpaid, unvested sabbatical.  Primarily for reasons of precedence, he was unwilling to pursue this option, which, while it is disappointing to me, I accept.

The purpose of this note is twofold.

First, I would like to thank you for making this company the great place it is today, and for giving me the opportunity to have a great career here.  I will forever look upon my nine plus years with Enron fondly.

Second, I would like to ask you as the administrator of the 1997 Long Term Incentive Plan to allow me to explore opportunities in the venture capital community without triggering non-compete provisions with regard to future payouts.  I very much enjoyed my brief role in venture capital, and have some very good contacts in that area here in New York.  Since NetWorks decided to cease operations in that business earlier in the year, I should not think that Enron would view anything I might do there as competitive, especially if I were not working directly in the energy space with an Enron competitor.

At present, I am planning to spend my time at least through the summer enjoying, and travelling with, my family.  I have nothing planned professionally as of yet, but wanted to take the opportunity to drop you this note while I might still be viewed positively (I hope that's not too presumptuous!).

Please let me know your thoughts on this non-compete provision as I would not wish for anything to be awkward for us going forward.

Again Jeff, thanks for many great memories, and as an Enron shareholder, keep up the great work!

Jay

I think the meeting went well. You do realize I had to get a lot of ground
work done. Dave is a smart man and he was very positive. He indicated to us
after you left, he will like to see us work with you to get a few deals
moving, realizing the culture of ATT.He will go out of the way to help you
and me accomplish what we think is best for the entire industry.

You may want to send him a thank you note, -  draft enclosed. Feel free to
edit it and add your style. Look forward to working with you. There are so
many thoughts in my mind which one day I will like to download on you -
perhaps over dinner. Please check with Ken how to work out the arrangements
with Adventis on the ATT relationship building , Sourcing and the Japan
related opportunities.

Talk to you soon.

  <content name="title" action="cluster">Re: Clinton Energy Vacation Policy &amp; Request</content>
  <content type="text" name="message">I was disappointed,  to say the least, at the return email I received from you so I waited before replying so as not to react in haste. Previously I stuck to facts and did not bring things of a personal nature into the equation. I feel, however, that there are a few things you should know about me and how I have exemplified the ENRON VISION so you can realize why I took this so seriously and why am, to be blunt, ticked off at the resolution.
In the 4 years that I worked on the scheduling desk for Clinton I never missed a day of work.........not one.
I never took vacation during bid week or during tie out time.
Between 96 - 00 I took all but 3 days vacation between the months of May - October so as not to interfere with winter gas operations.
I have had nothing but above average reviews in the past 5 years,  been promoted twice, and received special recognition for working shorthanded through the winter of 99-00.
As you can see I have consistently put ENRON ahead of personal conveniences and strived to do the right thing for the company. I am distressed that the very values Enron holds me to ring hollow with regards to how I have been treated.
Changing vacation rules, be it legally legitimate, does not exemplify INTEGRITYin my eyes!
Not stating a policy change (THERE HAS STILL NEVER BEEN A FORMAL STATEMENT OF THIS CHANGE) does not illustrate COMMUNICATION!
Stating that I will be paid for vacation less any I take between now and the severance date is deceptive at the least and would not constitute RESPECT, EXCELLENCE nor INTEGRITY!
FACT - items 1 - 6 in the original email are 100% true. #2 is of the most significance as the words came from the lips of our HR representative that I would be paid the vacation amount we discussed UNLESS I TOOK ANY VACATION BETWEEN NOW AND JUNE 1st.
FACT - At least 2 people were allowed vacation time off during this transition (Susan Weison, Sheri Wallace)
FACT - If you check my vacation records you will find that I have taken a vacation EVERY YEAR IN MAY. My request was made, like in all previous years, a few weeks before I wanted to take it. HAD I KNOWN THAT THE RULES OF THE GAME WERE GOING TO BE CHANGED I WOULD HAVE MADE MY INTENTIONS KNOWN EARLIER.

In conclusion I do not expect, or even wish for a response. I have enjoyed my time with Clinton Energy and Enron. I have learned much and forwarded my career greatly and for that I am thankful. I just wanted you to know where I am coming from and how an unfortunate situation of severance was turned into one in which I leave being taught a lesson by Enron that does not make me a better person, just a smarter one. This lesson; a spotless record &amp; loyalty to a company means very little. It is better to look out for #1. In the end the company you work for is going to protect their best interests regardless of the rhetoric in their Vision Statement. Thank you for your time.

Respectfully,

Sean Zurbrick

Sean;

Thank you for bringing your concerns to us.  We value the input of our employees, and constantly seek ways to improve the quality of our employee benefits.  After talking to some of the parties involved in this matter and reviewing our vacation policy, we find that your management acted within the scope of its responsibility and within the bounds of our vacation policy.  In addition, we find no evidence of inconsistencies and believe that you and your co-workers at Clinton have been treated equitably and fairly regarding the denial of vacation during this transition period. 

In closing, we support the decision to deny vacation requests to the Clinton employees affected by this transition.  Should you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to direct them to your management

Subject:	Clinton Energy Vacation Policy &amp; Request

I have held discussions with Tim Weithman, Ashley Kerr &amp; Ken Brooks (immediate supervisor) regarding a request for vacation for the 3rd or 4th week in May. I have been told recently by both Ms. Kerr as well as Mr. Weithman that those of us being severed from the company are not permitted to take any vacation time between now and June 1st. It would seem that there are several inconsistencies regarding Enron policy as well as how the subject was presented both to the group as well as individually. Below are the inconsistencies I speak of.

During the group meeting in the beginning of April there was no mention of "vacation freezes". The only reference to time that was mentioned was that you must be employed by Enron as of June 1, 2001 to receive the severance package.
During my private discussion, in which both Ms. Kerr and Ms. Gray were present, I was presented with the specifics of the severance package. I specifically remember being asked for my current unused vacation amount. I gave them the amount of 152 hours and was told that I would be reimbursed for that total unless, of course, I took any additional vacation. This implied that regular Enron vacation policies would be in effect. Again, at no time was it presented to me that I was ineligible to take ANY of my earned vacation or that there would be any deviations from normal Enron policy regarding vacation.
At no time has Mr. Weithman, Ms. Gray, Ms. Kerr or any other Enron agent made public a policy of vacation freezes.
At no time were there ever any public or private requests that the plans for those with previously scheduled vacations to be made available to any Enron agent.
I can find nothing in my severance package that states any deviation from the standard Enron vacation policy.
I realize that Enron policy requires vacation approval from the supervising employee. It states in that policy the following:
"An employee's preference for scheduling vacation should be adopted when possible."
"The supervisor must verify that unit staffing needs are met before approving an employee's vacation request."
I am currently still an Enron employee.  I have also verified that staffing needs are met. 

In summary, as you can see there are several inconsistencies with regards to the vacation policy for those being severed at Clinton Energy. It more than offends me that I am being prohibited from taken ANY part of the 152 hours of accrued vacation that is, by all accounts, mine to take. This being said, I am formally requesting one last time that I be granted my vacation request during the month of May. Furthermore I would like this approval as soon as possible so that I may make necessary arrangements. As you review this I am consulting an attorney so that I may be advised of my rights regarding this matter.

Thank you,

Sean Zurbrick

There was no hesitation on April's part to make loans to Jenny and me.  Compensatory efforts have resulted in April taking Jenny and me to lunch, Amy initiating and funding another lunch for us and Dave Parquet mandating us four hours pay for waiting at home on a Saturday to recieve replacement checks via Fedex that turned out to be non-negotiable.

I have cc'd Jeff Skilling because I believe he needs to know that he has very efficient and compassionate people working for Enron.  April, Amy and Cristina, thank you for being yourselves.</content>

  <content type="text" name="message">Joannie: Thank you very much. I appreciate Jeff giving me a few minutes out of his busy schedule (May 24 at 3:00 p.m.). Here are some questions that are pertinent for our discussion. 

Are there two or three experiences you look back on having been especially valuable in helping develop your leadership style? Why did you find them valuable?

How have your views on leadership changed over time?

How do you think organizational changes or global changes impact on leadership styles?

What motivates you and how do you motivate others?

Do you ever have time to reflect on your leadership style in a particular instance? if so, what process do you use for evaluation?

What are the most important leadership skills for the energy industry? Does leadership style change for other industries, such as the airline industry or the automobile industry?

In order to prepare a paper for my graduate class on Leadership, I would like to interview you as a leader. Some questions that would be of interest would be what events conspired to bring you to Enron, what developmental process you knowingly (or unknowingly) went through in your early years and what challenges have you encountered that made a significant change in your career.

If you would be amenable and have the time, I would like to interview you sometime next week for about 30-40 minutes. If you wish, I could provide you questions in advance to maximize your time.

Thank you for considering this request.

  <content type="text" name="message"><![CDATA[June 8, 2001


Dear JEFFREY SKILLING:

We are delighted that you have made a smart energy choice by signing up
with NewPower(tm) as part of the Texas Electric Choice Pilot Program.
Tens of thousands of Texas households have joined you in taking advantage
of the tremendous savings NewPower will provide you over the next two years.

As your new energy supplier, we wanted to make sure that you were informed
of a recent development affecting you as a participant of the pilot
program. NewPower was recently notified by the Texas Public Utility
Commission (PUC) that the pilot program will be phased in more slowly
over the summer months. A more gradual timetable for processing switches
from your local utility to energy service providers, such as NewPower,
will help to ensure a seamless transition between energy suppliers for
the thousands of Texans who have enrolled in the program.

Click below to read the official announcement from the Texas PUC. This
requires you to have Adobe Acrobat Reader:
http://i2.innovyx.com/newpower/pilot_ltr.pdf

If you do not have Adobe Acrobat Reader, please click below and follow
instructions for free download:
http://tr.innovyx.com/redir.asp?148_46_1029

What does this mean for you? It simply means that your NewPower service
will begin during July instead of June as originally planned. Until then,
your existing provider will continue to provide your electricity,
uninterrupted. Rest assured, once your NewPower service begins, you'll
still get the same great rates and excellent customer service you were
promised when you signed up.

There is no need for you to take any action.  NewPower expects that the
Texas Public Utility Commission will enable us to begin providing your
household with electric service after July 6th.

In the meantime, NewPower will send a welcome letter notifying you of the
effective date of your NewPower service.  If you have any questions or
concerns, please visit the Public Utility Commission's website at
http://tr.innovyx.com/redir.asp?148_47_1029 or call NewPower
at 877-819-9817. (For help in Spanish, call 1-866-523-4176.)

Best regards, and welcome to NewPower!

Nick Utton
Chief Marketing Officer

  <content type="text" name="message">Dear Jeffrey:

I came across your name in the business press. As an industry leader you are
knowledgeable about the latest trends and where the companies are heading. You
constantly meet top managers and some may be hungry for management talent
and/or require rapid change action.

What value can I bring?

I have nine years of combined experience in management, change consulting,
international marketing and business development.  Most recently, I took part
in transforming Fortune 500 companies into more active e-business players.B
 efore, in four years I have developed international markets from 0 to over 40
country coverage, 140 companies and units (mostly in Europe, but also in the
Middle East and in Asia).

I am looking for right opportunities and growth challenges.

If the organization wants to speed up their international expansion and avoid
some costly mistakes, I can bring in a successful record of developing business
and resources in country-to-country approach, balancing
think-global-and-act-local theme.

And/or

If the organization can benefit from broad range of change experience: I led
project teams of art designers and copywriters achieving national promotion
goals, led researches towards addressing relevant issues in their projects, led
consultants in delivering management change programs for major corporations,
led the creating of new customer and supplier networks globally. These were
project teams representing diverse experience, background, and management
levels.

And/or, finally

If you would like to share your insider's perspective on where the industry is
heading in exchange I can provide my insights into developing business in
Europe.

I am flexible on location and only a phone call away.


Sincerely yours
Robert Rogowski

  <content type="text" name="message">Steve Kean and I believe quite strongly, within a four peer group structure,  that we need to allocate somewhere between 30 and 50 percent of Gov't./ public  Affairs out of commercial support into specialized technical- there is a clear divide between individuals in the Gov't/public  Affairs groups  who are managing significant risk for the company and having a significant and  direct impact on commercial activities/ net income( these individuals should be moved to specialized technical)....and others who are performing a less strategic function( who should remain in the commercial support category). With that said, it is probably not necessary to undertake this effort for  mid-year PRC purposes since we are probably moving to a three peer stucture where that split could be achieved (for year-end purposes where the compensation impact would be felt). If we stay with the four group stucture, I intend to push hard for the remapping of Gov't Affairs by year-end.
    On a completely seperate issue, I continue to be  very concerned about the impact of the "preferred" distribution  relative to the bottom category for " commercial support" groups(I'm not implying this is'nt an issue for commercial groups- I just don't have the same ability to assess the impact there)....the concern, simply stated,  is that  it may be entirely  counterproductive to force individuals who are not performance problems  into a category that has significant implications for their careers here at Enron, particularly after going thru the past year where many of the non-performers in my group and others  were moved out of the company- the replacement costs for moving good performers out of the company for the sake of a "preferred" distribution are quite high...and that is even before you begin  to assess the incalcuable damage to morale that will invariably occour.
       Thanks.

Subject:	PEER GROUP MAPPING

Following my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group mapping for all business units. This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.

We were considering moving to a 3 Peer Group Structure however it as agreed at the last PRC Committee Meeting  to stay with the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most activities had been placed with the exception of just  2 or 3. It was agreed that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 Peer Groups. All functions/activities within the business units should now be reflected on the acttached. 

The actions points from this excercise are:

1	to review and agree the attached mapping 

2    consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in previous PRC meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them 	as indicated on the attachment.

3	invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider questionable or requiring further explanation.

      Please return your comments to David Oxley by Friday May 25.

      To have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final VP/MD PRC Meetings.  Definitions of the peer groups are also attached for your ease of
      reference.

[IMAGE]	 [IMAGE]     Dear Jeff Skilling,   Selecting the right gift or seasonal accent to adorn your home  or office is made easy with our original bouquets, orchids and  preserved designs. Each of these intriguing items has its own  character and ambience and is meant to complement the good life.   Take our Orchid  Blaze Bouquet  (shown right) for example. With its fiery orange  orchids and black matte vase, it makes the perfect seasonal centerpiece.  This eye-catching bouquet is easy to arrange too.   The Colmanara  Orchid Plant  is quite possibly the most exciting new orchid  to be introduced in the last decade. This alluring orchid, nicknamed  ?Wildcat? is diligently sought-after for its long lasting  blooms.   Our Antiqued  Holiday Wreath  is a preserved design whose color scheme works  with most decors. It is available with our brass wreath hanger,  making it a breeze to display. And don?t forget the ideal  autumn birthday gift! The Golden  Harvest Roses  bouquet is sure to add special meaning to a  wonderful occasion.  Remember to visit Autumn  Sales  where you will find keen gifts like the Autumn  Jewel Arch  at very special prices!  Calyx  &amp; Corolla   	[IMAGE]

[IMAGE]	 [IMAGE]     Dear Jeff Skilling,   The finer things in life are sometimes green. Our modestly monochromatic  Fragrant  Eucalyptus Bouquet  (shown right) is a natural display of greenery  that shows true luxury has nothing to do with imposing grandeur.  Easy to arrange in our architectural glass vase, the bouquet can  be left to air-dry naturally for enjoyment indefinitely in the  home or workplace, and has a unique fresh scent.   With its handcrafted, grass-covered pot, our Grass  and Grain Sculpture  is an unusual dried arrangement in a natural  palette of beiges and pale gray-greens. Perfectly suited for any  type of gift giving, it is an interesting way to add natural beauty  to a setting and best of all, it requires no care.  As the weather changes, you can surely add warmth to a special  occasion with our decisively different Strawflower Plant . Also known as Everlasting Flower or Paper  Daisy, our cheerful Strawflower plant will bloom for months. The  papery petals actually make a rustling sound as the flowers open!  Two eclectic fall specials we are proud to showcase this October  are our Obake Anthuriums  and our majestic Protea   that create a much-admired tropical look.   Please remember National Boss?s Day is Tuesday, October  16. We invite you to visit our Specials   page for ideal gift selections &amp; our Sale   page for limited-time offers.

Red Herring will use NDA to raise funds for the victims of the September 11th tragedy.
Red Herring has organized several charitable activities for the two-day conference and
will donate $100 for each registered participant to a fund to help victims in New York and
Washington, D.C.
This year's NDA will take  Red Herring's predictive look at the biggest ideas still to come
over the next 12 to 18 months.
Presenters include:

infrastructure sectors
* Explore real-life case studies and business solutions that have succeeded and failed

  <content type="text" name="message">
		 	
		[IMAGE] 	
[IMAGE]	 [IMAGE]     Dear Jeff Skilling,   Now that fall is finally here, it is time to showcase  the season?s brilliant color. Decorators in the know accentuate  this changing season with the high-energy hues of gold, burgundy,  orange and yellow. Calyx &amp; Corolla has taken their cue. We  offer a divine medley of colorful bouquets, preserved designs  and even bulb kits paying tribute to fall.   Our Williamsburg  Bouquet  (shown right) is a stunning assortment of terra cotta  colored roses, golden Peruvian lilies, russet hypericum berries  and unusual velvety orange coxcomb. It truly recreates the look  of the pedigreed blooms found in the historical manor homes of  Virginia. The exceptional crackle-finish footed urn in which it  is displayed is adapted from those in the European market circa  1800.    Our sweet Rose  Spice Wreath  brings a concentration of fall color to a small  area while our Golden  Harvest Roses  proclaim the season in a riotous display. Combining  ruffled yellow roses with flaming orange roses it's a wonderful  choice for any occasion   We're pleased to introduce our new Ranunculus  Bulb Kit . This sophisticated flower is well known for its  dense, round heads of distinctive crepe paper-like petals and  has been noted by many trend watchers for its growing popularity.  Our kit is a unique take on these blooms and makes a perfect gift,  especially for those with children.

Red Herring will use NDA to raise funds for the victims of the September 11th tragedy.
Red Herring has organized several charitable activities for the two-day conference and
will donate $100 for each registered participant to a fund to help victims in New York and
Washington, D.C.
This year's NDA will take  Red Herring's predictive look at the biggest ideas still to come

be in town next Wednesday Aug 22nd.

I have attached our Bear Stearns Stratis Program for your review as well.
Many execs are finding  access to these top money managers and lower fees,

  <content type="text" name="message">Dear Messer's Skilling and Lay,

I heard a song with the lyrics "how can I say thanks for all the things you've done for me", I'm pretty sure it's by Andre Crouch.  Let me thank you for the help and loving kindness you and ENRON has shown to me during the period after the devasting floods.  I've never worked for such a wonderful company before, the people here in every walk of life are so very friendly.  The scriptures speaks of drawing people toward you with loving kindness, and you certainly have here at ENRON.  The people that i've met here want to be here and that's a good sign.  One morning on the elevator a lady was singing on the way to her floor, i didn't recognize the tune right away, probably because it was early morning, the tune turned out to be "OKLAHOMA" so I joined her, she invited me to come and be a part of the ENRON CHOIR.  Just  the other day you Mr. Skilling passed my desk and asked had my group just moved to the 31st floor, i've only been here at ENRON since January '01 and wasn't aware that my group had moved from the 29th floor.  My Grandmother always used to tell me as a child, "you better keep a thought in mind, that someones watching you, and they want to be just like you, setting their examples by you, and they're never gonna miss a single thing you do.  And I live by that today.  Well I can be a little longwinded,  but remember:

If I can help somebody  as I pass along,
If I can cheer somebody with a word or song,
If I can can show somebody that he's traveling wrong,
Then my living shall not be in vain.

And you both have certainly obeyed that dictum.


God Bless You Both,

Enron Beats Analysts' Expectations
Energy Company Enron Reports Earnings Increase of Almost 40 Percent in  Second Quarter
HOUSTON (AP) -- Enron Corp. (NYSE:ENE  - news ) reported a nearly 40 percent increase in  second-quarter earnings on Thursday and beat analysts' expectations due to  robust growth in its power marketing and energy management businesses in the  United States and Europe.
	


The Houston-based energy wholesaler and retailer earned $404 million for the  quarter ended June 30, or 45 cents per share. That compared with $289 million,  or 34 cents per share a year earlier.  
Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call predicted earnings of 42  cents per share.  
Despite continued growth in its natural gas and electricity trading business,  though, Enron's stock has faltered in the past year due to unmet expectations  for its high-speed Internet business.  
Enron's broadband business reported a $102 million loss, compared with an $8  million loss for the same quarter a year ago.  
Enron President and Chief Executive Jeff Skilling said Enron would  ``significantly'' reduce spending in its broadband unit ``to match the reduced  revenue opportunities currently available.''  
Enron reported $50.1 billion in revenue for the second quarter of 2001,  almost triple the $16.9 billion reported for the same quarter a year ago.  Company officials expressed confidence of reaching $1.80 per share in earnings  for the full year 2001 and $2.15 per share for 2002.  
``Our wholesale and retail energy businesses continue to dramatically expand  business activity and increase profitability,'' said Skilling.  
Enron has been embroiled in the conflict over California's energy woes, with  a committee of that state's Senate issuing subpoenas to the corporation and  other generating companies earlier this year in connection with an investigation  of possible price manipulation in energy markets.  
Shares of Enron rose 45 cents to close at $49.55 on the New York Stock  Exchange Thursday. Enron's stock was trading above $70-a-share at this time last  year.

  <content name="title" action="cluster">RE: Enron Guest Speaker</content>
  <content type="text" name="message">Hi Jeff--
    Hope you're well! Forgive me for taking advantage of my family ties on
this. I'm getting a kick out of the calls I receive with increasing
frequency from people who know my brother is Jeff Skilling and wish to know
whether we're related or, as in the case of the included e-mail, to
investigate a speaker for their group. I don't know whether this is possible
or whether your group does this (I suspect they very well might given
Enron's stellar reputation in this area), Jeff, but I met this fellow at the
AMS annual meeting (actually it was in Los Angeles) a couple of years ago
and he's writing to inquire about a speaker from Enron willing to talk to
the Washington, D.C. American Meteorological Society Chapter about weather
derivatives and the energy industry's interest in the weather.  He an Air
Force major and is clearly well informed and approaching the right folks in
your team to address this issue.  Any chance this can be done?  My guess is
they'd cover all expenses.
     Have to tell you, Jeff, that my VP/General Manager John Vitanovec came
in the other evening and told me he'd just purchased more Enron stock and
the good things he'd heard about it.  I told him I just had bought some
Enron too. I can remember him telling me of his first purchase a year or
more ago. Everybody here knows my brother and I get such a kick out of that.
You're regularly mentioned on our top rated morning show--they had your
picture on just the other morning.
     Sorry to take your time on this, Jeff. Please don't worry about this if
there's any problem with it.  I hope you're well.  Please give my best to
Rebecca and to Sherri!  Take care (and no more pies)!

                     Tom



JEFF---
   Here's the e-mail inquiring about an Enron speaker from Major Kenneth
Carey, U.S. Air Force, The Pentagon.  Thanks!

                                 Tom



Tom

Hello from our Nation's Capital!  You and I met at the AMS Annual Meeting in
San Diego in 1999 (see attached picture of you and I!).  You're very well
known and I applaud all of the good things you're doing for both your
Chicago and national viewers, weather-wise, but, more importantly, your
tremendous and positive community involvement!

 &lt;&lt;Tom Skilling.bmp>>
As a chapter officer with the District of Columbia Chapter of the American
Meteorological Society (DC AMS), I want to get the very best speakers with
inspiring, entertaining, and thought-provoking topics for our chapter
membership.  I can't think of anything much more exciting in our profession
than that of weather derivatives, and the products and services for our
energy and agricultural sector that is a booming part of our field.

I'd like to get someone from Enron to speak at one of our chapter meetings.
I understand you may have an inside track to Enron and I wanted to inquire
if you could help us get an appropriate person to talk to our chapter about
weather for their business ventures.  I'd like to also get someone from the
weather provider perspectives, like a company like EarthSat Corp, so we
could get a better understanding of both the weather provider and customer
perspectives.

I look forward to hearing from you and best of luck with your future
professional and personal endeavors!

Best Regards,
Ken

  <content type="text" name="message">To the attention of:
Mr Jeffrey K. Skilling
President and Chief Executive Officer
Enron



Dear Mr Skilling,

These are extraordinary times for all of us, and I want to share with you
important news concerning our next Annual Meeting.

The events of 11 September and their aftermath have created a special
interest in our upcoming Annual Meeting. We all share the understanding
that we are living in a new era of fragility and are looking for signposts
that establish a way forward. Participation in our Annual Meeting of top
business, political, intellectual and civil society leaders promises to
make our Annual Meeting, more than ever before, the place where we confront
our problems head-on.

This calls for an Annual Meeting that is much more interactive than in the
past. We therefore have developed a programme concept designed to engage
our Members and participants in dynamic discussion and problem solving on
key aspects of the Global Agenda. We appeal to you to consult the programme
concept from 15 November onwards on our website (http://www.weforum.org)
and to provide us with your feedback as soon as possible.

In order to develop a road map of international cooperation for the future,
we believe the most pressing issues for us to tackle are reversing the
global economic slowdown, bridging the poverty and educational divides,
enhancing security and improving cultural understanding throughout the
world. With these as our goals, we felt that New York would be the ideal
place for our next Annual Meeting. The decision has the enthusiastic
approval of the Forum's Foundation Board and Business Council as well as
the full support of Governor George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. The
Annual Meeting 2002 will represent an unparalleled effort to mobilize all
the leaders behind our mission: to bring business and society together in
partnership to improve the state of the world.

We will work closely with your staff to provide all necessary information
related to travel, accommodation and security. The Meeting will start on
Thursday 31 January and end on Monday 4 February 2002. The principal
location will be the Hotel Waldorf Astoria.

We will spare no efforts to make sure that the informal spirit of Davos and
its hard-working atmosphere are not only preserved but intensified, and
that the Meeting will be truly outstanding in its collective impact. We are
confident that we can count on you to give this exceptional "Davos in New
York" your full support and engagement.

Respected Sir,   
I'd worked with Enron India for 18 months and I'd admired the company for quite some time. Finally I got the opportunity to work with Enron in India and being an Indian I thought it would be privilege for me to serve my home country working in such a respectable company. I really enjoyed my stay but I found Enron India opposite to my belief. I would like to share with you few experience to help you take some steps to safeguard the image of the organization and prevent its further damage.
 
?        There has been no standard policy for anything like travel, compensation, accounts and few old anchors of Enron India who were having very close proximity with CEO (Sanjay) had been enjoying the kingdom with their own methods. 
?        New Delhi office has been the best example of high level of unprofessionally and corruption especially in office Administration where concerned executive used to take undue advantage of the strong relationship with CEO and lack of procedures and guidelines. I'd seen Admin Manger misusing office cars, mobile phones in abundance.
?        Being a liaison office and less proximity from Mumbai office, a Sr. VP had created a well protected fort where nobody could raise any resistance even if one clearly just to realize that these people have so strong roots.
?        Admin person used to take all kinds of favors to give them orders despite better competitors. This includes AC contractor, CAR dealers, carpenters and other office suppliers.
?        An admin Manager (Jaya Kumar) has got assets worth three times whole life compensation is worth considering to prove the fact the all is not well with Enron India with so many such people around. 
?        Although lots of improvement has been done during the past 4-5 months by HR and present CEO (WADE) but still these people could survive and instrumental in leaking confidential information to ex-CEO/Media and making good money.
 
I believe Enron is a very reputed and professional organization and my sentiments are still the same but considering the sensitivity of situation under current circumstances, somebody should keep a watch on Sr. VP and Admin Manager duo who had been together for almost 8 years (They were together even before joining Enron India) and audit all the transaction done by them for the last couple of years.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

A well wisher and admirer for Enron

Jeff:

Professor Howard Stevenson (Harvard Bus. Sch. - Entrepreneurship) will be in Houston on the 14th or 15th of June to discuss a new case study that HBS is preparing entitled "Modern Giants".  Professor Stevenson would like to feature Enron in the case and has requested a brief meeting with you followed up with lunch with any available HBS alumni.

I have attached an email from the HBS Director of Development who contacted me, which summarizes the proposed case and provides a bio on Professor Stevenson.  Are you interested in Enron's participation in the Case Study? and would you be available for a brief meeting with Professor Stevenson - and possibly lunch?

In my view, we need to refresh the Enron story being told through HBS Case Studies.  The Dabhol Power Case (still being used) is dated and does not reflect our business strategy.  I have asked HBS to contact your office directly to check your availability.

Regards,
Brian

Brian,

It was good to meet you last week in Houston.  Thanks for taking the time
to see me and for giving me an overview of Enron, our alumni there, and
what you are up to.  I'm glad the recruiting seems to have gone well for
you this year.

Thank you, also, for helping us put together a group of our alumni at Enron
during Howard Stevenson's trip in June.  Howard will be in town June 13th -
15th.  Would it be possible to arrange a lunch at Enron on Thursday June
14th or Friday June 15th? Ideally, it would be great to give Howard and
Jeff Skilling the chance to meet together first, say at 11:00 or 11:30,
followed by lunch with our alumni.

I've attached Howard's bio, as well as the electronic version of the Modern
Giants proposal as promised.  In addition, I will fax you a list of HBS
alumni at Enron. Howard would be glad to discuss a wide range of HBS
matters, including the Modern Giants project.  If the lunches on these
dates do not work, let me know and hopefully we can work out an alternative.

  Many thanks, Brian.  I'll follow up with you some time next week, but
feel free to call me any time.

Cheers,
Josh

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to
Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this
weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise
$50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't
you consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you
tomorrow...

Sherri :-)

Rev. Lawson would like to thank you for extending to him the invitation to
participate in the 2001 Big Cats Gala on June 14, 2001 at the Bronx Zoo in
New York.  Unfortunately, he will not be able to attend the event, and the
Wheeler Avenue budget for this year is not such that we can comfortably make
a contribution.  He would like to convey to Mr. Lay, however, that he
rejoices with this esteemed honor and will continue to keep his friend in
his prayers.

Thank you,

  <content type="text" name="message">I am sure that you have forwarded this email to a more senior Michael Brown, however, I would be glad to pledge to Jeff's ride this weekend.  You see, last fall my daughter died of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), she was nine months old and if they find a cure for MS, the cure for SMA will not be far behind as they are simular deseases.

So I would like to pledge $500 towards the ride in honor of my daughter, Hayden.  All I ask is that when the ride gets really hard, to think of her &amp; all the others like her that will benefit from this ride, then peddle little harder.

You can send someone to pick up my check as I am located @ EB 3108F.

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

EXECUTIVE BRIEF

FOR

OCTANE ENHANCEMENT SYSTEMS, USA

Loan Amount: $60,000,000 USD
Type of Project: Manufacturing Facilities
Loan Term (maturity): 10-15 years
Project Venture Share: Between 30 and 50%, depending on the Lender's proposed
split between equity investment and loan.
Funding Stage: Straight-debt funding, equity investment or a combination of
both for a start-up without a financial history requiring capital for
facility construction.
Objective: The employment of its technology in a world-class refinery to
upgrade low value petroleum feedstocks into aviation fuel and marketable
ultra high octane blending stock for unleaded gasoline.
Market: The Client Company's process for making unleaded gasoline has been
operated on a semi-plant scale for several months and the products
successfully sold to independent gasoline distributors.
Company Investment: The Client Company's project team members have invested
six years and in excess of $1.5 Million USD in developing the technology.  In
addition, the management team is comprised of eight individuals who have
between them over 200 years of successful experience in the petrochemical
industry in R&amp;D, project management, and refinery management.
Total Asset Value: At the time of the completion of loan draw down will be in
excess of $153,000,000 US. (See 'Asset Value with Facilities')

Purpose:
Phase I  - Ammonia fertilizer
Phase II  - Reclaimed solvents
Phase III  - Pollution Free Gasoline

1. Company Introduction - The Client Company was formed specifically to
commercialize its proprietary technology and the expertise for:

1) The conversion of low BTU natural gas in ammonia for fertilizer.

2) Specialty refining and reclamation of spent solvents and rafinates from
plastics manufacturing in order to convert these streams into products that
can be sold as unleaded gasoline and diesel fuel.

3) The refining of low value petroleum feedstocks into pollution free
aviation fuel and marketable ultra high octane blending stock for unleaded
gasoline.

4) The reclamation/refining of spent chlorinated solvents in order to market
these streams as unleaded gasoline and diesel fuel.

5) The employment of its technology in a world-class refinery to upgrade low
value petroleum feedstocks into aviation fuel and marketable ultra high
octane blending stock for unleaded gasoline.

In order to minimize the overall risk and the time required to achieve a
positive cash flow, the Client Company has developed a multi phase Strategic
Production Plan

Phase I is the smallest of the phases and will employ the Client Company's
expertise in ammonia production from low BTU natural gas.  Phase I can be
completed and show a profit within seven months of initial funding.

Phase II is somewhat larger than phase I and will employ its own unique
proprietary technology and a separate geographical facility location.  Phase
II can be completed within about twelve to fourteen month after funding and
the will show a profit about two months after startup. The future of this
phase of the Client Company's strategic plan is somewhat less clear today
than it appeared several months ago when the plan was developed.  The recent
dramatic rise in energy prices in the US has caused some generators of the
spent solvents that will be the feedstock for this facility to begin using
these streams for fuel.  A reevaluation of this situation is underway at the
present time and the decision as to the future of this phase will be made in
late first quarter of 2001.

Phase III, although much more capital intensive than phase II, has been
separated from phase IV for several reasons:

1. Environmental permits - the Phase III facility will be purely a petroleum
processing facility similar in principle to several hundred other petroleum
processing facilities in the State of Texas, and therefore, obtaining an air
emissions and operating permit should not take over six months.  In contrast
to this, the permits for the reclamation of the hazardous chlorinated
solvents, Phase IV, will require between ten and eighteen months if all goes
well.

2. Equipment deliveries - the technology to be employed and the absence of
corrosive compounds in the processes for Phase III will allow the equipment
and piping to be fabricated out of common carbon steel rather than the exotic
alloys, which will be required for the Phase IV, chlorinated solvent
reclamation process.

3. Transportation - the handling of the petroleum feedstocks and products for
Phase III are much simpler than the chlorinated solvent feedstocks for Phase
IV.

Phase IV will utilize a location in the US while Phase V will probably be
located in the Caribbean.

2. History of Project: The project team members have invested six years and
in excess of 1.5 MILLION DOLLARS US in developing the technology and the
business opportunities which are described herein.

3. Mission Statement: The Client Company's mission is to capitalize on the
business opportunities it identifies, profitably employ its proprietary
technology, and where possible assist in solving environmental problems.

4. Funding Stage: Is a start-up without a financial history and is seeking
capital for facility construction and startup - straight debt funding, equity
investment or a combination of both.

5. Project Ownership? / Management
THE MANAGEMENT TEAM
The management team is comprised of eight individuals who between them have
over 200 years of successful experience in the petrochemical industry in R&amp;D,
project management, and refinery management.  In addition the team includes
another individual with in excess of 25 years of financial experience in
banking, investment banking and financial management.

THE SCHEDULE
From the point of the first financial draw approximately 6 to 7 months will
be required to construct the phase I plant, go through startup and be ready
to commence full-scale production.  The other phases will follow as indicated
above.

6. Unique Features (Key Considerations) of Project:

Ammonia production - This phase of the Client Company's strategic plan will
commercialize its principals' expertise in fertilizer production and
marketing and their successful experience in adapting proven processes to
unique opportunities.  The Client Company is in the process of finalizing a
gas purchasing agreement with a firm that has acquired the mineral rights to
large area of land in west Texas under which is located a significant deposit
of low BTU natural gas.  The Client Company can purchase this gas at very
attractive pricing.  While this gas is not suitable for sale as "pipeline"
quality gas it is suitable for the production of ammonia.

Solvent reclamation - This phase of the Client Company's strategic plan will
commercialize its proprietary technology and its principals' expertise in
reclaiming spent solvent streams and rafinates, and refining them into usable
fuels.  Some of these are currently being incinerated as hazardous waste and
others are being blended into low value products.  The Client Company's
proprietary refining technology has the ability to process these materials
and convert them into value added products.

Pollution free gasoline - This Phase of the Strategic Production Plan will
commercialize its proprietary technology for the refining of low value
petroleum feedstocks into pollution free aviation fuel and marketable ultra
high octane blending stock for unleaded gasoline.

The Client Company will utilize ABC Industries to broker its products and
assist in feedstock procurement. ABC Industries currently arranges for the
supply of feedstock to DEF Fuels, one of the Client Company's major
customers, and brokers their products.  ABC Industries will also
broker/market to other customers any left over high-octane blend stock and
all of the aviation gasoline.

The Client Company plans to offer its unleaded gasoline at a price of
one-half to one cent below the locally posted rack price.  Rack price is the
price that a distributor pays for products at the terminal loading rack and
varies somewhat from day to day and though out the year as gasoline demand
and crude oil prices vary.

FEEDSTOCK SUPPLY - The feedstock for the ammonia facility will be low BTU
natural gas from the gas field directly under and surrounding the facility.
The feedstock for the solvents reclamation will be obtained directly from the
generators of the spent solvents.  The feedstock for the gasoline production
facility will be obtained from several LPG producers in the West Texas area.

The cost of the majority of the Client Company's feedstocks have historically
tracked the price of crude oil as has the price of gasoline at the rack and
retail pump.  The solvent feed stocks will be procured from the generators
with the aid of several brokers who normally deal in these materials.  These
spent solvents will be shipped to the Client Company facility at the port by
truck, railroad tank car and barge.

THE TECHNOLOGY - The Client Company has developed its own proprietary
technology for:

1. The refining/reclamation of spent solvents and rafinates and their
conversion into value added products.
2.  The production of ultra high octane blend stock for use in unleaded
gasoline and aviation fuel.
3.   The reclamation of chlorinated solvents.

The possibility of patent protection for these technologies is being explored
with one patent already filed.  Initial patent searches do not indicate any
potential infringement of existing patents, but the Client Company makes no
representation as to the ability to secure patent protection.  However, every
effort will be made to protect the confidentiality of the nature of the
processes that the Client Company will employ in its facilities.

The Client Company process for making unleaded gasoline has been operated on
a semi-plant scale for several months and the products successfully sold to
independent gasoline distributors.

The plants will be designed to meet all of the current standards including
EPA, API, OSHA, ASME and good engineering practice.

THE COMPETITION - The Phase I operation will face very limited competition
because the ammonia plants which in the past have served the west Texas, New
Mexico, and western Oklahoma area have all been shut down during the past
several years.  Therefore, all of the ammonia consumed in the region is being
shipped in by truck or railcar.  The Client Company believes that freight
considerations alone will provide sufficient cost differential to insure that
it can successfully sell its 50,000 tons per year of product into the local
market.

The Phase II operation will face very limited competition because we have
been able to identify only one dedicated facility that is doing work similar
to what the Client Company will be doing.  The main advantage the Client
Company will enjoy is the ability to assure the generators of the spent
solvents and rafinates that their waste will be processed in such a manner,
and with the high level quality control which only a dedicated facility can
maintain, that the end products will be of such quality that the generator
will no longer face the present contingent liability caused by product
failure in their final application.

For the Phase III facility at Dallas Texas, the Client Company will face very
little local competition for its ultra high-octane blend stock and reasonable
competition for its aviation fuel.  At the present time there does not exist
any local producer of ultra high-octane blend stock and it along with
aviation fuel is being shipped in from the Gulf Coast and other more distant
suppliers.  Others who might attempt to duplicate the Client Company's
approach will not have access to the Client Company's proprietary technology
and will be at a distinct economic disadvantage. At the present time the
Client Company is not aware of competition that might tend to drive up prices
for the petroleum feedstocks (i.e., normal and isobutane) that will be used
in its Phase II process.  These feedstocks are available in more than
adequate quantities at the prices used to calculate the proforma's.

7. Overview of Market: - The overall nationwide market for unleaded gasoline
is in excess of 342,000,000 gallons per day. The overall nationwide market
for aviation fuel (100 octane gasoline) is in excess of 67,000,000 gallons
per day.  The local Dallas Texas market for aviation fuel is in excess of
750,000 gallons per day.  This market is expected to grow about 2% per year
for the foreseeable future. The Client Company has set as its corporate
objective to capture 15% of the Dallas aviation gasoline market over the next
five years.

Approximately six billion gallons per year solvents are used in the US for
various cleaning applications.  The disposal of the resulting hazardous waste
is a major cost for the user.  The Client Company will use these spent
solvent blends as a feedstock and thereby remove the "hazardous waste"
designation from the material.  At a processing rate of 100,000 gallons per
day the Client Company will process about 0.6% of the solvents that are
available for recycle or reclamation in the US.

8. Financial Overview (USD) - see the attached proforma.

9. Use of Funds - see the attached sources and uses statement. (The numbers
are solid to use at project.  In the loan amount, we have add the pre-funding
cost)


ASSET VALUE OF the Client Company W/FACILITIES

TECHNOLOGY - Within 18 months of initial funding the Client Company will have
the following patent applications filed and assigned to the Client Company:

1. Composition of matter patent covering its butane isomerization catalyst.

2. Composition of matter patent covering its structured/ solid alkalation
catalyst.

3. A process patent covering its chlorinated solvent reclamation catalyst.
 
4. A process patent covering its process for the optimum dispersion of light
hydrocarbons in ethanol.

5. A process patent for its process for the reclamation of an existing waste
solvent.

6. A process patent for its process for benzene destruction in Platformate.

7. Several (3+) process patents for the reclamation of spent solvents and
rafinates.

The patent searches for all of these have been completed and in the informal
opinion of our patent attorney all of these patents will probably be granted.

Number 1 &amp; 2, above, can currently be obtained from UOP and Phillips
Petroleum, for example, for about a million dollars per year (royalty or
technology fee) each.  Once we have fully proven these two in long-term plant
performance tests, the Client Company may well elect to market this
technology.

By present day appraisal methods, (i.e. actual and estimated royalty values)
these patents will be worth between five and seven million dollars per year
to the Client Company.  Using standard "future value" calculations (ten
years, 3% inflation) the asset value of these patents is $67,800,000.

LAND - Dallas Texas  - It is the Client Company's intention to purchase
approximately 100 acres of land in Texas as the site for the Dallas / Ft 
Worth facility.  A portion of this land will be purchased

It was a pleasure having you here on campus.  Let me add my thanks to those
of the Entrepreneurial Manager faculty who actually taught the case.  I
think your presence added enormously to the success of the maiden voyage of
this case.

As I indicated to you, I want to make the case even stronger by
incorporating any additional data or suggestions that you may have after
seeing it taught.  Jeff, you indicated you had a couple of quick
corrections, and I'd appreciate receiving those.  Also if you have any
thoughts about how we might enrich the case, those would be welcome
too.  Christie, as indicated in our discussions, I think some sense of the
economics of Enron Online would be enormously helpful.  Even if we have to
use disguised data, can we break out the sales and profitability of the
trading operations before the launch of Enron Online.  With some indication
of what the new Internet-based model will do to margins, students can do
some simple calculations of the volume necessary to compensate, and
therefore have some idea of the enormously ambitious (and significantly
risky) venture that this turned out to be.  I will gladly talk further
about this with you directly or with whomever you want to put me in touch
with.  Let me emphasize that the data do not have to be actual data--we can
use disguised information that multiplies all the real data by a factor,
for example.

Thanks again for your incredible support through the development of this
material and its delivery.  I think it was a great success.

Regards,
Chris

P.S.  I am just looking at the beta version of the multimedia cases on
Enron's Transformation and Enron Online. These should be ready within a
couple of weeks and will allow students to read the case and click on
images of Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling, and Louise Kitchen as they talk about the
issues raised in the case. This should help students come to class with an
even richer understanding of the culture, values, and personal style of the
key players.</content>

  <content type="text" name="message">
Dear Mr. Skilling

Your executive assistant suggested that I email you with my request.  I am
a partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP located in Calgary, Alberta.  On a
recent flight on United Airlines, I read with great interest, the article
in United's in-flight magazine about what you did at Enron with regard to
convergence.  To say the least, I was impressed.  Many of our clients in
the Calgary, particularly in the Energy Industry, are dealing with the
concept of convergence.

The purpose of this email is to ask if you would be a guest speaker at one
of our Executive Breakfasts.  PwC Calgary holds three to four Executive
Breakfasts each year which usually has about 100 ? 150 CEO's, CFO's
attending.  We hold these sessions at the Palliser Hotel and they do a
great job in having an upscale event.

I sincerely believe your "Enron story" will interest many of our energy
clients and non-clients.  I would be pleased to discuss this further at
your convenience.  You have my email address or I can be reached at my
Calgary office (403) 509-7530 or residence (403) 241-2930.

Best regards,


Dennis J. Hoffman

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

Sherri :-)

  <content type="text" name="message">Mr Skilling,

I would like the opportunity to talk to you at some point to discuss your vision and goals for the Broadband
Operating System (BOS), and strategic development in general in Enron/EBS. 


Since EBS is currently focused almost exclusively on short-term tactical delivery  (which it should be), I'm not 
sure how strategic efforts like the BOS fits into those goals.   Balancing these tactical vs. strategic goals is 
becoming _very_ difficult.  Indeed, because of the current customer-specific tactical deliverables, there is 
very little strategic development going on in general in EBS.  Yet I know that BOS is still a very important  
deliverable.  

I want to make sure we're doing everything we need to do to support your goals and vision for EBS.

It would _really_ help me if I could hear a little bit more about your short/med/long term goals for the BOS, 
and perhaps some of your thoughts about EBS' technology and products in general.  Then we could discuss 
ways to properly balance the tactical and strategic efforts to achieve those goals.


---


On a different topic, I understand that you are currently thinking about potential projects for the Xcelerator. 
And I understand that you are focusing on technical products and capabilities that do not overlap the current 
&amp; past initiatives at other business units.  I think that there are many great opportunities in that approach.

I have seen a number of very interesting product concepts from various people in Enron that 
would fit that model perfectly.  And I'm sure there are many many more.   As a sample, I've attached 
a short document  listing just a few of the technology-focused ideas that I have heard about.

I also included the idea of commercializing BOS as a stand-alone product on that list.  Perhaps this is
one way that BOS could continue developing within Enron without interfering with the current tactical focus.
Obviously, EBS would still be the primary customer for BOS no matter how it is developed.

....just a thought....


Thank you for your time.  

		-larry

Attendees:

AT&T:  David Dorman,  President of AT&T (bio points below)

Enron:  Jeff Skilling, Stewart Seeligson, David Cox

Adventis: Partha Ghosh, Andy Belt and Mark Bruneau (via telephone)


Background:

As you well know, over the last 9 months EBS has made substantial efforts to establish a significant commercial relationship with AT&T.  Thus far, there have been no transactions between EBS and AT&T other than a couple dozen of circuit purchases by us mostly local loop.  Previously, our primary senior point of contact with AT&T has been Frank Ianna (President of Network Services).  It is probable that Ianna brought only the typical legacy perspective which prevented him from seeing how we could facilitate the AT&T business from a wholesale relationship.  They seemed to only want to sell us services.

Adventis advises us that Ianna now reports to David Dorman and that Dorman should be able to better understand the value that EBS can bring to further his business objectives.  It is my understanding that it will only be Dorman at the meeting (he is supposedly not bringing Ianna).  I view this meeting as a worthwhile shot to see if it is worth pursuing AT&T at all for the balance of the year for a big transaction.  Dorman's positive receptability to us is the only reason I can see to spend significant resources on AT&T in the near future.


EBS - AT&T History

Jun 2000 EES sponsored Executive Briefing with focus on EES and EBS - attendants include Frank Ianna from AT&T.

Oct 2000 - Extensive EBS team meets with extensive AT&T team to set up eight tactical and strategic working teams to find opportunities for the 		companies to build a bilateral commercial relationship.  After three weeks, results were presented to executive committee of both teams. Nothing materializes.

Potential Opportunities

AT&T currently spends a significant amount each year (expected to be in the $100s of millions) on offnet services (wholesale expenses) .  EBS would like AT&T to allocate a potion of the purchases towards EBS.

Adventis states there are currently numerous major undertakings by AT&T which are transforming the telecommunications operations at AT&T.  Is there not something EBS could do to help advance these undertakings?

At a minimum we would like AT&T to interconnect to our pooling points.


Final Note

I do not think we should lead with trading.  We should lead with our ability to provide services to the wholesale sector of the industry. The typical reaction we get from incumbent players is that if they don't trade or if they think that trading puts downward pressure on prices, then they should not do business with Enron.  They need to understand that they don't need to trade to have a valuable business relationship with  Enron

  <content type="text" name="message">Jeff, 

I will be heading out to Macerich's offices to meet Macerich's management team. At that meeting, we will be discussing the outsource and the future relationship between the companies.  He would also like me to speak to his direct reports about change management and other cultural characteristics of Enron.  However, he would really like you to provide a presentation on the same general topics to the Macerich Company Conference in June.  He has heard you speak and believes your approach and perspective can benefit the conference.

Obviously, these guys are an important relationship and reference for our commercial and real estate business.

Let me know your interest.

Regards
Delainey

Angela - thanks for making time to have dinner with us on Wednesday:  it
was great to see you.

As Art mentioned, since the time we have started working with you, we have
made frequent references to our operating teams about Enron's
accomplishments in the areas of customer excellence and employee
satisfaction.  More generally, we've held Enron out as an example of a
highly accomplished company in all the areas Macerich is currently focusing
on as an organization (operational integration, customer orientation,
scalability, change leadership, and strategic focus).

All of that being said, we would be extremely appreciative of an
opportunity to have either Jeff Skilling or Dave Delainey speak at either
of these conferences.  In any event, we're delighted that you would make an
effort to see if this can be put together.

Relative to upcoming Macerich events, there are two scheduled:

(1) University of Notre Dame Executive Education Program, May 7 - 9 in
South Bend.  The curriculum is centered on change leadership and strategic
thinking (officially "Enhanced Leadership and Strategy in the New
Economy").  Attendees include our Executive Team (Art, David, Rick,Tom, Ed,
and Larry Sidwell) and our Operating Team (17 SVPs).  There is also a
round-table discussion scheduled with our Board on May 9.

(2) Macerich's Company Conference, June 4 - 7 in Park Cities, Utah.  The
emphasis of the conference will be on our "e-Business Transformation" (more
specifically on becoming wholly integrated across functional roles,
customer facing, and highly scalable) and capturing value in our "Value
Network" (relationships we have with retailers, partners, vendors,
shoppers, etc.)  The attendees for this event include the same people at
UND as well as our managerial professionals from the malls and our
corporate offices (about 250 people, total).

Let me know if you need any additional background or information.

Eric

  <content type="text" name="message">Dear Mr. Skilling,

	My name is Chris Weekley and I am David and Bonnie Weekley's son.   I am
writing because I am in search of a summer internship (paid or non-paid).  I
recently had out of town plans fall through and this is why I am beginning
this process seemingly late.  I am a junior at Vanderbilt University and I am
majoring in Human and Organization Development with a focus on Leadership
Effectiveness.  This major studies organizations and the human interactions
that allow them to effectively operate.  I have taken various courses in
organizational theory, economics and human relations.   I think it would be a
great opportunity for me to gain experience within Enron.  I would be more
than happy with any type of job from research to customer relations.  For the
first three weeks of summer I will be a counselor at a Christian sports camp
leaving me available from June 11th until August 8th.  I am trying to tie
something down in the next few days prior to my departure for camp if at all
possible.  Thank you so much for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Chris Weekley

  <content name="title" action="cluster">Speaker invitation to Economist Conference 24-25 October</content>
  <content type="text" name="message">Dear Mr Skilling

Following the success of our three previous annual conferences on the e-business and technology sector, the Economist Conferences is delighted to announce that we are now planning our fourth annual event Creating Value with Internet Technologies,  to take place in London in October of this year. We would very much like to invite you to deliver a keynote address at this event.

Now that spending on IT and systems is once again being evaluated in terms of productivity gains and returns on investment, companies are refocusing their efforts towards cost savings and efficiencies. As companies integrate the Internet into their supply chains, they frequently find that they need to change much more than their communications technology. Their strategy, their approach, their deployment of skilled people, their divisional structure - all these things get challenged.

We would very much like to hear your perspective on the potential for the e-marketplace, but, at this stage, I would also be happy to hear your suggestions.

The project is still in the early stages but we would like to secure our key speakers as early as possible. I am sure your diary will be very busy but we feel it would be of great value to have you there. Please find attached a draft outline of the event, and some further information about the Economist Conferences.
I do hope you will be able to consider our invitation, as your participation would certainly help to ensure that we offer an excellent programme and further add value to this annual gathering. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me on one of the numbers below.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours sincerely

  <content type="text" name="message">Dear Ken: 
This note builds on the earlier voice mail, and a memorandum I have sent to  
you, following the Dave Dorman meeting. Given the initial ground work done by  
our team at ATT leadership level, the meeting between Jeff and David Dorman,  
we think did go as expected by us. I am sure Dave and Stewart, along with  
Jeff have shared their views of the meeting, and do feel positive about  the  
process forward. 
Our take on the meeting is as follows: 
1. Dave Dorman is open and eager to explore ways ATT and Enron could  
cooperate across the board. 
2. Dave wants to move fast, but at a pace that will work within ATT, and is  
strategically sound for both the organizations 
3. He is now looking forward to specific value propositions from  
Enron-Adventis team, which he is prepared to discuss with us. 
4. On that basis I am sure he will guide us to the most appropriate guys  
within ATT who will need to understand and act on the value propositions. 
In view of the above the real work begins now. As discussed with Dave and  
Stewart, we will further reinforce our commitment to develop, and take the  
basic proposals with ATT forward. Our team is already on the job and will  
meet with Stewart early this week. 
I did indicate to both Dave and Stewart that we will like to take the next  
steps in a most expeditious and matured fashion so that all the strategic  
possibilities to create the new bandwidth dynamics between the two companies  
could be achieved. 
Given that there were some hesitation within Enron on the out come of the  
first meeting with ATT, we committed to the last 2.5 weeks of work with a  
reduced fee structure. Now that the first major step has been successfully  
taken, we plan to work with you along our normal professional fee schedule.  
As we do want to move as fast as possible and if at any point indications are  
that the desired out come will be difficult to achieve we could stop and  
review progress. As a result, although not common, we are willing to work  
with a weekly rate, adjusted to professional fees of $75,000/week and out of  
pocket expenses. In addition of course for an engagement of this nature which  
essentially leverages our firms professional credibility and trust in the  
industry, our clients pay us on the basis of successful execution of the  
alliance formation along preset milestones.  
Given the strategic nature of this engagement, and our commitment to assist  
you with all the major Telcos, -- incumbents and new, we will welcome to  
learn from you the basic structure of a formula which Enron is most  
comfortable with; typically in other situations in my professional life, we  
have been rewarded in three stages: 
1. On signing of  the letter of intent(s) 
2. On  signing of the agreement(s) 
3. On launch of the first project (s) 
Ken, while we look forward to formalizing the above, please enure we sustain  
and if not increase the momentum gained from the first summit meeting last  
Thursday. If we do the right things, the upside is indeed huge. We of course  
should also start thinking through how to build the same kind of work

  <content type="text" name="message">Mr. Skilling,

I wanted to make you aware of the fact that I was leaving NewPower.
My last day at NewPower should be in the week to come.

Foremost, I wanted to thank you for the time you have given me while I was at Enron and NewPower.
This past year at NewPower has been a very intense and intellectually lucrative learning experience, which have brought me many skills.
My experience at both companies has been wonderful, fruitful and exciting.

I was glade to see that the NewPower/Enron Employee program faired well.

Best continuation, as President &amp; CEO of Enron Corp and to your family.
Will look forward to the chance of meeting with you again.


Regards,
Wilson Kriegel



I have attach my resume, so you would see the opportunities and experience I have gained at Enron &amp; NewPower.

  <content type="text" name="message">
Hi  Jeff,
 
I am following up on  a confidential manuscript I sent you a few days ago of "Digital Storm  - Fresh business strategies from the Electronic Marketplace".  Is is a book about B2B E-Commerce and E-Markets after the hype. It will be  distributed by Wiley this summer as an A+ title (lead category) and Hasso  Plattner, CEO of SAP wrote the preface.
 
Enron is  featured as the most successful marketplace to date with a bright  future.
 
I was wondering,  whether you would like to include a testimonial for the book.  It would certainly also be good marketing for Enron's entry into new  marketplaces. For your convenience I include a potential  quote:
 
Running  the world's largest electronic marketplace, we embrace the opportunities and  challenges of B2B E-Commerce. In 'Digital Storm' Philipp Gerbert and his  colleagues give a powerful analysis of what has been learnt and invaluable  insights for future strategies in this area. 
(you can of course  write what you want; more ideas are in the attachment, which also contains  additional information).
 
I apologize that  this is a bit urgent - the deadline is Friday this week  May 18th). 
 
I very much hope  that you enjoy the manuscript. Perhaps you would be interested to further  discuss the ideas. 
 
Best regards, Phil  Gerbert

  <content type="text" name="message">

IDC's Flagship Event:
 The European IT Forum 2001 - 11th Edition
 Grimaldi Forum, Monaco, 17 and 18 September
 "Old and New Worlds Collide in Europe: Will Business Take the Leap?


 Dear Mr. Skilling,

 Business  leaders,  market  players  and media representatives who attend IDC's
 European  IT  Forum  each  year  rate it the most prestigious and authoritative
 eBusiness conference in Europe.

 Past  speakers  at our Forum have included global business leaders such as Bill
 Gates,  Larry  Ellison,  Scott McNealy, Tim Koogle, Michael Capellas, Sir Peter
 Bonfield;  Economists  and  Technology  Gurus  Nicholas Negroponte, Gary Hamel,
 Jeremy  Rifkin,  George  Gilder,  Geoffrey Moore; Venture Capitalists, Bankers,
 eBusiness Stars and the most senior IDC analysts.

 Although  we  are  still  several  months  away  from this year's event, we are
 pleased  to  confirm the participation of the following industry leaders: Carly
 Fiorina  (CEO  of  HP),  Michael  Capellas  (CEO of Compaq), Jeff Bezos (CEO of
 Amazon.com),  Joe  Tucci (CEO of EMC) and the "gurus" Gary Hamel, Lester Thurow
 and Michael Porter.

 The key themes this year will be:

 -   the Internet stock crash and current economic slowdown
 -   how Internet technologies can help overcome the present financial downturn
 -   how the economy of established companies and the new order of dot-coms are
 merging
 -   how companies can formulate winning strategies by combining the Internet
 with traditional competitive advantages
 -   how Europe can take advantage of current favorable market conditions to
 catch-up with the US
 -   how investments in Internet infrastructures and eCommerce will drive a
 major economic development worldwide over the next decade

 We  would  be  honoured  if  you  would  accept our invitation to speak at this
 important event during the breakout session entitled: "eBusiness Strategies for
 Brick &amp; Mortars"that will take place on Monday 17 September at 16.00-17.30.

 We  anticipate  a  select audience of CEOs and board-level delegates as well as
 columnists  from  key  European publications, as well as TV and other broadcast
 media.

 We hope that you can accept our invitation to present your vision of the future
 of the internet economy at IDC's European IT Forum.

 I look forward to hearing from you soon.

 Best regards,


 Roberto Masiero
 President IDC EMEA

Sorry for the original e-mail below.

A Portuguese speaker sending e-mails in English where he should not.

Attached is the email from Jorge.  We are in the process of terminating Jorge due to performance and relation issues.  We are doing this immediately due to the nature of Jorge's job, although we were trying to delay until the replacement was in place.  Given recent actions (not the email below), we have decided to move forward with the termination this afternoon.

Thank you for agreeing to interview with Vijay Vaitheeswaran of the Economist on Tuesday.  Mike is scheduled for 12:30, Jeff for 2 p.m., Greg for 3 p.m. and John for 4 p.m.

Vijay is working on a story about old economy companies embracing the Internet.  He'll be testing the idea put forward by Erik Brynjolfsson of MIT that companies profiting most from the Internet are ones with a culture of openness.  As background, he has secured an advance copy of a new Harvard Business School case on EnronOnline, which basically outlines the advent of EOL.  It's a story that you all know well, and so you should not be disadvantaged if you don't have a copy of the study. (I can give you one if you want it.)

Specifically, he'll be probing:
How did the company begin to think about using the Internet?  Have our views altered?
What role models did we use?
What changes have worked best and why?
How far has success been dependent on changing corporate culture? Has it gone far enough?
What has been the impact on staffing?  Do we have the right people to do what needs to be done?
Has the Internet made -- or will it make -- substantial cost savings?  What is the scale of investment needed?
Will the Internet change the way we work with suppliers/distributors (where applicable).

Other companies on the list to be interviewed include GE, 7-Eleven, Siemens, Merrill Lynch, Cemex and Valeo.

Let me know if you have any questions.  Otherwise, I'll see you in the afternoon.

  <content type="text" name="message">Oscar Wyatt and Tom Bachtell have agreed with our recommendation to hold off doing anything pending the results of the MCN/MCNIC arbitration scheduled July 23 - August 10.

They also were unaware that our convertible preferred was non-voting which effectively ruled out doing anything at the June shareholder meeting along the lines they were considering since the record date has passed.

Subject:	Crown Energy

I spoke with Oscar Wyatt this afternoon on Crown and subsequently to Tom Bachtell, an attorney in Utah who is attempting to organize shareholders to replace existing management.  Crown has an asphalt oil sand production facility in northeast Utah and an asphalt distribution company.  Bachtell owns about 4-5% of the stock.  Mr. Wyatt indicated he had a "small" holding.  I indicated that we would consider any proposal that might result in salvaging some value from this investment.

We hold convertible preferred and a small amount of common at an original cost of $5.5 million in 1997.  Fully converted, our ownership would be approximately 25%.  The Company has a net deficit of $21 million and a "going concern" paragraph in its audit opinion.  We have written down our carrying value to nil.

The Company in engaged in an arbitration proceeding against MCN Energy and MCNIC Pipeline.  MCNIC has interests in the asphalt assets and is a lender to Crown.  MCNIC attempted to foreclose on certain Crown assets and Crown in turn counter-sued for $100 million.  The arbitration hearing will be held July 23 - August 10.  If Crown obtained an award from the arbitration, some value could be restored to our investment.

We will get further information from Bachtell on the details of his plans and recommend what position Enron should take in this matter.</content>

Following Phil Carroll's letter to you of April 16 I would be delighted to call on you to tell you more about Hakluyt.  While we have already done some work for Enron (Scott Tholan), virtually all our work for our clients is at a strategic level where our coverage of issues is of greatest value.  With your challenging international objectives I am confident we could be of value to you.
If you would find it useful to meet I will contact your office to arrange a suitable time.
Yours sincerely

  <content type="text" name="message">Dear Houston Technology Forum Attendee:

On behalf of Houston Technology Center and Summit Registration, we hope that
you have a safe and enjoyable Memorial Day holiday.  Please remember that
the day you return -- Tuesday, May 29th -- is The Houston Technology Forum.

Registration for the Forum begins at 10:45 a.m.  You many wish to park in
surface lots near the Hyatt Regency (1200 Louisiana), or you may opt to
valet park at the Hyatt.  Valet parking will be discounted to $7.00 with the
validation stickers that HTC will provide.  Please bring your parking
ticket, and stickers will be available at the end of the program as you're
leaving.

Please arrive at the Hyatt as close to 10:45 a.m. as possible, keeping in
mind that the other 1,029 Forum attendees will be arriving as well and
needing to park or valet.  The earlier you arrive, the more time you'll have
for networking and enjoying your lunch.  Luncheon service will begin at
approximately 11:20 a.m., and there will be no food service after noon.

When you enter the Hyatt Regency, please proceed upstairs to the third
floor.  Check-in will be in the foyer outside the Imperial Ballroom.  Name
badges will be arranged alphabetically by individual attendee's last name.
If you have been appointed as a substitute between Friday and Tuesday, you
will need to find the line for the person's last name for whom you are
substituting to get your badge.

If your plans have changed, and you need to cancel, please go online by noon
on Friday to cancel your reservation.  If you receive a confirmed
cancellation by noon, your account will be credited.  No cancellations or
refunds will be accepted after noon on Friday.

If you are a primary contact for a full table, please pass this message on
to the other guests at your table. We look forward to seeing you on Tuesday.

  <content type="text" name="message">
Hi Mr. Skilling,
I am hoping that you can direct me to the correct  person to vet a sponsorship opportunity to the LatinSummit. The LatinSummit is a  unique forum for Enron to gain invaluable exposure at the same time as the World  Bank &amp; IMF Annual Meetings. Below and attached is information on the  upcoming event.  Please consider this opportunity and I look forward to  hearing from you.
Sincerely,
James Ontra

			 The Premier Conference on  Investing in the Americas Presented during the 2001 Annual  Meeting of the World Bank Group and  the International Monetary  Fund October 1-3, 2001 Omni Shoreham Hotel - Washington  D.C.   International  Venture Partners, LLC is pleased and excited to announce our  upcoming Latin American Investment Summit (LatinSummit), the premier  conference on investing in the Americas, presented during the Annual  Meeting of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund.   The LatinSummit is a unique opportunity for your  company to connect with top business executives, government officials and  other potential customers at the largest and most important annual  gathering of world leaders from the public and private sectors. Adjacent  to the LatinSummit will be the ExpoAmericas, consisting of a  maximum of fifty exhibitors, including some of the most prominent  international companies working in Latin America.   Why should your company be a Sponsor?  The Annual Meeting attracts over 15,000  participants, including presidents, ministers, other senior  government officials, as well as thousands of senior level executives  from the private sector.   The Annual Meting attracts extensive international  press coverage and is televised throughout the world. Full media  coverage.  Three-day Conference with top-level speakers  from the public and private sector. LatinSummit will explore the  unique challenges of financing public and private sector projects in  Latin America with a focus on infrastructure finance, capital markets,  commercial lending, mergers and acquisitions and private equity  investing.   Very exclusive ExpoAmericas, with no more than  50 exhibitors and open admission to all Annual Meeting and  LatinSummit attendees. Your company will have maximum  exposure.     LatinSummit will be held in the same venue as the  Annual Meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund,  providing ideal networking opportunities.  Because LatinSummit is organized by IVP (www.ivp-ny.com), an investment banking firm  focused on Latin America, and not a conference organizer, we will ensure  that the agenda covers only the most poignant topics.  Presented by the organizers of Cyber Americas (www.cyber-americas.com) at the Inter-American  Development Bank's Annual Meeting in March 2001. Past sponsors include  PriceWaterhouseCoopers, Oracle, American Airlines, Optiglobe, Lucent  Technologies, Accenture, Impsat, America Online, Global Crossing,  Greenberg Traurig, Bloomberg, Exodus Communications and others. Our  experience will ensure an extremely successful  event.  We are offering a variety of sponsorship opportunities  from which to choose from. We hope that you will join us for this unique  event.  Feel free to contact me at your convenience.

  <content type="text" name="message">Mark,

You are a couple of days ahead of me.  You have a good tickler file.

First, may I  offer my  congratulations on your recent marriage.  You moved to Turkey to write - now you have someone to share your life experiences.  Life is good.

I am doing great.  The market appears to have bottomed out is now "ratcheting up".  And yes- our new president is headed in the right direction with his tax cut and especially his energy policy.  If we can just keep the Governor of California from going too far out into left field and people realize  what we have today was a result of the "past" president.

Speaking of field,  I went to Enron Field last night.  Fantastic baseball stadium.  A must on your travel list. I'm sure someone else you may know  also feels the same way.

Yes, it's premium time again.  Jeff made a $15,000 Gift to the Trust on 5/2/01 - Send Crummy Letter after this date. I told Jeff when he made the gift, I would be contacting you to make the premium payment at the end of the month

I will e-mail you on 5/30/01 the exact amount your are responsible to pay.  As last year, I will e-mail a Word attachment you can sign and fax back to me.  I then will ensure premiums are paid by both parties.

Thanks,

Keith

  <content type="text" name="message">On May 10, 2001, a memo was sent out regarding "Peer Group Mapping".  This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.

Please refer to the attached original memo, if you have not responded to David Oxley and have any comments 
please respond to him by May 25, 2001.

Dave Delainey



Following my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group mapping for all business units. This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.

We were considering moving to a 3 Peer Group Structure however it as agreed at the last PRC Committee Meeting  to stay with the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most activities had been placed with the exception of just  2 or 3. It was agreed that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 Peer Groups. All functions/activities within the business units should now be reflected on the acttached. 

The actions points from this excercise are:

1	to review and agree the attached mapping 

2    consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in previous PRC meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them 	as indicated on the attachment.

3	invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider questionable or requiring further explanation.

      Please return your comments to David Oxley by Friday May 25.

      To have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final VP/MD PRC Meetings.  Definitions of the peer groups are also attached for your ease of
      reference.

Thanks for taking time to call  yesterday.  Good luck with the Lockyer situation.  I truly do believe  that direct and prompt interaction with Lockyer will prove more effective for  Enron than delayed or intermediated action.    As we discussed,  if I can be of any help with reconnaissance or as sounding  board, just let me know.
 
I have attached an article from  this morning's LA Times.  It provides an California view on how the  shakeup in the Senate might impact the state's energy  situation.  Certainly, by the time that President Bush visits  the California in a few days, the state's two Democratic US  Senators will be a good bit more empowered.

Jeffords has never mattered much to Californians. Until now.        The Vermont senator's widely anticipated  decision to abandon his fellow Republicans and put Democrats in control of  the Senate could have big implications for California, particularly on  energy and environmental policy, lawmakers and lobbyists said Wednesday.        The change, which Jeffords is expected  to announce today, could increase political pressure on the Bush  administration to respond more aggressively to California's electricity  crisis, these insiders said.       And it  might force the White House to compromise on key elements of the national  energy policy it unveiled last week. In fact, the administration's  proposed budget cuts for programs to promote renewable energy were said to  be a factor in Jeffords' decision.       At  the very least, Senate observers said, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) is  likely to get the floor vote she has sought on price controls for  wholesale electricity.       That doesn't  necessarily mean that the administration's critics will be able to have  everything their way. Even if the Senate approves electricity price caps,  for example, the measure would face stiff opposition in the GOP-dominated  House--and a likely veto if it made it to the president's desk.        Still, a Democratic majority in the  Senate would give Feinstein and other party members a platform to turn up  the political heat on the administration and congressional Republicans on  energy policy.       "It kicks up the dust,"  groaned one energy industry lobbyist who requested anonymity.        Observed Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.):  "If President Bush's hard-edged conservative approach has in fact caused  the balance to shift towards Democrats in the Senate, it will have  profound implications not just for California, but for the environment and  our nation's energy policy."        Environmentalists seemed almost giddy as  they contemplated the possible impact of Jeffords' decision on the  policies they care about.       All of a  sudden, they said, it seems less likely that oil exploration will take  place in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, that recreational  snowmobiles will have free access to Yellowstone National Park, or that  the administration's desire to promote nuclear power will be embraced by  Congress.       On the other hand, it seems  more probable that Congress would approve a new plan for managing a vast  swath of the Sierra Nevada to protect the region's oldest trees, consider  legislation to restrict emissions of carbon dioxide from power plants and  protect California from a resurgence of offshore oil drilling.        "It's stunning how broad the  repercussions are, particularly on the environment," said Gregory Wetstone  of the Natural Resources Defense Council. "We're trying not to count our  chickens before they hatch. But it will be easier for us in our battles at  least to keep from moving backwards."        For instance, Jeffords is a chief  advocate of a bill that would regulate carbon dioxide from power plants.  And if events play out as expected, he'll become the new chairman of the  Senate committee with jurisdiction over the issue.        Another issue under his purview would be  the two-decade dispute over a proposed repository for the nation's spent  nuclear fuel at Yucca Mountain in Nevada.        "Yucca Mountain is a dead turkey,"  declared Michael Francis of the Wilderness Society.        Environmentalists had been worried that  a number of pro-development provisions would be packed into appropriation  bills. But with Democratic senators in charge, that would become less of a  threat, they said.       "Every wacko idea  Republicans have will get a higher level of scrutiny," Francis said.        The biggest change would be the power of  Senate Democrats to decide which bills will be considered in committees,  and which ones will make it to the floor of the Senate for votes.        As part of a new Democratic majority,  Feinstein and fellow California Democrat Barbara Boxer are likely to gain  leverage with the administration on a number of issues considered  important to the state.       "That translates  into more federal assistance for California across the board," predicted  Steve Maviglio, spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis.        "I think it means more attention to our  state, for sure," Boxer said. "Right now, the president doesn't seem to  give a darn. They're all looking at California as a Democratic state.  They're not interested."       Feinstein, who  has been unable to arrange a meeting with Bush to discuss the energy  crisis, may get better treatment if winning Democratic support becomes  more important to the administration. She has been regarded as a  bridge-builder who worked effectively with Republicans in the past.        "This has not been a warm and friendly  administration," she complained Wednesday. "They've got people who know  all the answers and don't want to listen."        The White House disputed that. In fact,  Bush agreed Wednesday to meet with Davis during the president's first  visit to California next week.       Under a  Democratic majority, Feinstein would be in line to chair two  subcommittees: the military construction panel of the Senate  Appropriations Committee, and the technology, terrorism and government  information subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee.        Boxer would be in line to chair the  subcommittee on Superfund, waste control and risk assessment, and the  Foreign Relations subcommittee on international operations and terrorism.        Maviglio predicted that the effects of  Jeffords' expected party defection would be felt immediately.        The chairmanship of the Senate Energy  and Natural Resources Committee would be taken away from Frank H.  Murkowski (R-Alaska), who has been "openly hostile to California's  plight," and handed to Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), who supports Davis' request  for electricity price controls, according to Maviglio.        Democrats have assailed Bush's energy  plan for tilting heavily toward the supply side. With Democrats in charge  of the Senate, the administration would be more likely to compromise,  perhaps beefing up funding for Democrat-supported causes such as increased  energy assistance to low-income households and more aggressive promotion  of conservation and renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power.

Just wanted to let you all know that the following media outlets were at the press conference this morning:
Channel 2
Channel 45
Channel 48
KUHF radio (NPR)

The Houston Business Journal picked up the story and is currently running it on its home page (it will appear in print this Friday). 

Channel 26 plans on coming out to the awards celebration tomorrow night. The Chronicle and several other local papers are also working on stories.

Dear Mr. Skilling:

As part of Enron's Imagine the Future Day (4/24/01), a group of Ernonite's voluntarily got together under the tutelage of Dr Peter Bishop (Chair, Studies of the Future Program, University of Houston) to create scenarios of possible futures and their impacts on Enron. You once said, "I guarantee that if there is one thing Enron thinks about, it is what we'll do in the future." (ESpeak 2/29/00). With that in mind, you might find the following of interest - our ideas and thoughts about Enron and the future.  

The context created for envisioning possible futures for Enron was based upon our opinion of Enron's core capability: our ability to effectively exploit discontinuities in the marketplace. Enron has successfully exploited discontinuities created by pipeline deregulation, resulting in the creation of Enron; the Internet, resulting in electronic trading and on-line business activities/portals/exchanges; and telecom deregulation, resulting in bandwidth trading. Since Enron is so adept at this, we focused our activity specifically on identifying potential future discontinuities and their implications to Enron. These are our conclusions: 

Future: Rock Around the Clock  
Description: Anytime you want it, anywhere you want it capability to transact business/to do work. 
Discontinuity/Trends: Builds on discontinuities created by the Internet and current technology trends of convergence, increased ubiquity, wireless and miniaturization. 
Enron In This Future: Is fully and entirely networked; primary revenue generation occurs via the communication wires. Business ops "rock around the clock", 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Employees are fully networked and fully connected, giving employees the choice of when and where to work. Office space is no longer an issue because the employee IS the office. Employee uncertainties exist about privacy, lack of interpersonal relationships, and "wireless chains."
Wildcards: Major information systems disruption (global?) completely shuts down business ops; Enron wires unknowingly become 24-7-365 facility for international wire fraud and money laundering.  

Future: Not in My Region, You Don't 
Description: The return of regional protectionism and increased government interference. Globalization is seen as too overpowering, prompting regions to fight for a return of power and local sovereignty. The result is strong regional trading and political blocks that wield much influence. Their first action: restrictions on international business activities.   
Discontinuity/Trends: Contrary to discontinuities created by the fall of communism, and trends related to globalization and eroding boundaries; corresponds with current trend related to increasing numbers of regional economic unions (EU, CIS, ASEAN, Mercosur, NAFTA, etc). 
Enron In This Future: Is ordered by international authorities to dispose of non-US based assets (at a loss) and is forced to vacate foreign countries. Retrenching back into the US occurs. Enron's competition becomes increasingly intense and vicious as other multinationals retrench as well. This increased competitiveness occurs at the same time collective group/industry action is needed to counteract the action of the regional blocks, leaving Enron (and others) struggling to find a balance. 

Future: Regulation Re-run  
Description: Power and telecom re-regulation occurs. 
Discontinuities/Trends: Contradictory to current global trends toward privatization of government services; supported by social and political reaction to "CA style" market failures, perceived decline of competition due to provider consolidation, perceived supply issues with water, gas, oil. 
Enron In This Future: Goes "incognito", taking on a new identity. Governments seek to nationalize our assets. 
Wildcard: propelled and facilitated by increased regionalism and protectionism (Not in My Region, You Don't). 

Future: The Taxman Cometh - Even to Cyberspace 
Description: Internet commerce has become so big, taxing authorities can no longer resist - taxes are levied on all Internet transactions. 
Discontinuities/Trends: Corresponds with current discussion by US and others regarding Internet taxing; corresponds with the increasing power of the Internet as a purchasing mechanism.   
Enron In This Future: All of Enron's on-line transactions are now being taxed. The volume of transactions still remains high; record keeping becomes a nightmare.
Wildcards: Tax imposed is retroactive; government cannot track flow of funds and ability to tax accurately is ineffective.

Future: Enron's New "Corporate DNA" 
Description: rapid advances in biotech solutions lead to trading opportunities in biological "commodities."
Discontinuities/Trends: Corresponds with: recent technological advancements in genome mapping and sequencing, and cloning; increased political/social discussion regarding bio-ethics; increased business/social/political discussion regarding bio-based intellectual property rights. Uncertainties exist regarding the effect of biotech on human race/evolution. 
Enron In This Future: Is the first biological commodities trader in the world. Focus is shifted from energy into the biotech realm. Move clearly positions Enron as a company of the BioTech Century. Enron structures the new bio-market and creates new types of bio-commodities paper. Biotech trading requires a new type of trader with life sciences background; Enron forms relationships with medical, nursing and other bio-based programs for recruitment. 
Wildcards: biotech terrorism; worldwide epidemics; social opposition. 

Historically, discontinuities such as these favor smaller companies because they are inherently quicker to respond. As Enron grows, we become more vulnerable to rapid market changes because it takes longer for us to "sense" them and to react. While none of these discontinuities is certain of course, there is merit in understanding they may occur so Enron can 
"sense'" them and be prepared to respond early to the new opportunities they may offer. 

Of the futures this group constructed, Enron's New Corporate DNA is our most interesting and merits further "flushing" for details. I'm sure this group could do that well, should you be interested. There could be significant opportunity for Enron in the bio-tech trading future.

  <content type="text" name="message">     Hello Sukran and Mark;
     Welcome back to Turkey.
      I hope the weath weather is better in Turkey than here as it has been
cold for spring.  Temps in the 50's during the day and while we have had some
sunny days there has been plenty of rain.  I have been busy with my Golden
"K" Club (Senior Citizen Kiwanis).  We help with a picnic for mentally
retarded children, read to needy preschool children, help at mentally
retarded track meet, go to weekly meetings and etc.  I am told May is the
busiest month and it has been but it is almost finished.
     Mother and I have been watching the weather in Italy and imagining what
the two of you are doing.  Sue is back and catching up on their business.
This week besides Foundry work they have Visited an honorary dinner for one
of Jeff's college professors.   They are also doing some major work  on their
house.   The Sweeps are over at WGN-TV for a while so now Tom is looking
forward to his trip to Alaska a week from Thursday.  Jeff is still busy with
the gas problems so we hear little from him.  I hear Peter Widman is getting
married.  Though nothing definite I hear it will be in the fall.
     Nothing else for now.  Let us hear from you.   In the meantime  WE SEND
BOTH OF YOU  LOTS of LOVE and KISSES    MOTHER and DAD</content>

	Any chance of your providing insight on background on what's going
on at Enron. It seems to me either a lot of people know more than what has
been reported, or the debt and equity markets are overreacting terribly.

Mr. Skilling,

I have been attempting to work with Enron Broadband for over six months;
indeed, we have an 'Agent' agreement.  With the recent market
disequilibrium, it has become next to impossible to close deals with
your company.  Like you, I am a consultant, a deal-broker, a veritable
rainmaker.  Unlike you, I didn't consult with a big firm.  I am
independent an am extremely hungry.

That said, I would love to sit with you to discuss opportunities of
where Enron is going and how they are going to get there.  These
impromptu emails often work and have even afforded me one-on-one chats
with the likes of  VISA founder, Dee Hock!  I can provide further
background information should you be interested in meeting.  I have many
ideas on the telecom future for Enron that are exciting, practical, and
profit mongering.

I'd love the chance to speak with you over the phone, on instant
messenger, or even face-to-face.

With perspicuity and aplomb,

Michael Wilson

  <content type="text" name="message">Dear Mr Skilling,

http://www.ibc-financial.com/bm1272/?source=bm1272em2

Update on IBC's major international conference:
BASEL - MEETING THE PRACTICAL CHALLENGES
31st October and 1st November 2001 - New York

We have obviously considered very carefully whether to continue with this event in the light of the recent terrible events in New York. However, as the business community appears to be trying to get back to normal as far as possible, we have decided that the conference should proceed as planned.

We therefore hope you will take this excellent opportunity to hear the industry response to the latest Basel proposals on Capital Adequacy and Risk Management, and to gain practical advice on meeting the significant business challenges that these proposals pose to the management of risk within the financial services industry.

Conference highlights include:

* A keynote address from William Rutledge, Executive Vice President, FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF NEW YORK

* An impressive panel of leading industry speakers - visit the event website http://www.ibc-financial.com/bm1272/?source=bm1272em2 for full programme details.

* Round table discussion: examining the key elements of operational risk management and control

* Outstanding networking opportunity - over 100 delegates attended our European Capital Adequacy event earlier this year

To reserve your place call +44 (0)1932 853 857, visit http://www.ibc-financial.com/bm1272/?source=bm1272em2, or e-mail cust.serv@informa.com. Alternatively, please forward this e-mail to any colleagues from ENRON CAPITAL &amp; TRADE RESOURCES CORP who may also be interested in attending.

Kind regards

Allison Lindsay
Deputy Conference Director

Jeff,

We last spoke a month or so ago...just after you returned home from your
trip with your son, yet prior to your annoncement to leave Enron. You were
kind enough to return my call based on our YPO connection.

Since we last spoke, I have started a new company, APB Merchant Services,
within a very successful energy brokering company called APB Energy.

I would like to talk with you, or someone within Enron...perhaps Jeff
Donahue, about assistance in asset disposal. We represent a large base of
cash buyers and have successfully made markets in this Telecom space.

Either way, I would enjoy an opportunitty to catch up with you...please call
502.212.4908.

Jack Roth

  <content type="text" name="message">Hello Jeff-- I had been meaning to contact you recently but events somewhat curbed that idea. Wanted to know a couple things, first if we can continue to sent you The Desk, and second if you'd be intersted in participating on our editorial board. Not a lot of responsibility really, but, more of an on-call advisor on market or ops issues -- other members often submit commentaries for The Desk or The Risk Desk, Bandwidth Desk etc, on market issues and so on. Also, if you're on the board, we'll send you the publications for free -- anyhow, let me know. Interested to learn what your plans are--understand the pressure you publicly described from running the big E, but, all of us here and others in the market firmly believe this game would suffer a huge loss were that "Skilling fellow" to call energy markets "quits" for good. If there is anything we can do, let me know. Also attached the special edition we ran last week, in the wake of the NYC tragedy.

  <content name="title" action="cluster">An opportunity to contribute to Global IP Carriers 2002 programme, 17-19 April 2002, The Royal Garden Hotel, London...</content>
  <content type="text" name="message">Dear Mr Skilling,

As conference director for Global IP Carriers 2002, I would like to speak to
you to discuss the focus of next year's conference programme and to discuss
speaking opportunities at the event. It is a well established event for IP
wholesale and IP carriers infrastructure market and I would expect 100+
delegates for next year's conference. A tightly focused programme is most
crucial at this stage and this is the initial reason for contacting you as a
player within the marketplace.

IP networks are capable of delivering cost control and new revenues to
carriers. Internet traffic will grow, albeit not as fast as previously
predicted and we are moving towards all IP networks, certainly for the new
carriers. The areas that I would like to discuss with you cover a broad
range and if you would like to respond only on certain topics that is fine -
all feedback is invaluable for focusing the programme. The broad areas to be
covered include -

Quality of service - what architectures deliver? MPLS vs Diffserv? Gigabit
Ethernet vs ATM?
Service provisioning - areas of growth for service providers and will there
be self provisioning?
What methods of diffentiation are IP carriers at the edge of the network?
Bundling of services - challenges and opportunities
Customer loyalty and churn - strategies for building customer bases and CRM
Areas for revenue growth - value added services that will grow your revenue
IP VPNs - are they the killer app that will encourage enterprises to pay for
new fiber?
VoIP - predictions for uptake and challenges
IP Telephony - economies of scale for new carriers? implications for margins
of incumbents?
Access technologies - what is happening in the IP local loop
How softswitching is going to impact costs and its real advantages
Billing - IP Interconnect and implications for service provisioning
Costs of OSS and business support systems
What enterprise case studies you would like to hear about and what industry
sectors are the most relevant to you?

The delegate profile for the event will be CEOs, CFOs, Strategy &amp; Planning
Directors, International Network Directors, Sales Directors, Marketing
Directors, Business Development Directors, CTOs, IT Directors, Network
Architects and MDs of the following markets -

IP Carriers
ISPs
Bandwidth Exchanges
Optical networking equipment vendors
Consultants
Systems integrators
Billing vendors
OSS suppliers

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss the above topics with you and any
other topics you may feel should be included in the programme. If you would
like to hear from particular speakers also, please let me know and I will
endeavour to invite them to participate. There are speaking opportunities on
the programme as it is very much in its nascent stages and when I have a
draft programme written I would like to discuss participation with you.

I look forward to hearing from you soon as I am on a tight deadline as
always and ideally would like to speak to you for a short time sometime this
week.

Kind regards
Noreen Meehan

  <content type="text" name="message">September 13, 2001

Dear JEFFREY SKILLING:

We are writing to you (and the thousands of other Texas households who
have chosen NewPower as their new Retail Electric Provider) to keep
you informed on the latest developments in the Texas Electric Choice
Pilot program. There have been delays in implementing the Texas
Electric Choice Pilot program, but none of these delays are going to
ultimately prevent NewPower from using our energy expertise to deliver
savings on electricity to our customers.  Nor will they prevent your
local utility from providing the same reliable service.

Here is the latest information from the Public Utility Commission of
Texas (PUCT):

1.  After several delays, we are pleased to announce the Electric
Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) began processing switch requests
to NewPower on July 31, 2001.
2.  Unfortunately, the switch requests are being processed by
ERCOT at a much slower pace than originally promised.
3.  As a result, based on past experience, NewPower has been given
estimates that your actual switch date could take place anytime
between now and November 2001.

NewPower must comply with the revised ERCOT timetable.  We can't
supply you with electricity until ERCOT processes the switch request.
But here's what we can do:

1.  First and foremost, we want to assure you that we are
committed to providing the stability and value you were promised when
you signed up with NewPower for electricity supply... despite these
delays.
2.  As soon as your switch request is processed by ERCOT, we'll
send you a welcome letter notifying you that your service has been
switched to NewPower
3.  In the meantime, we are doing everything we can to encourage
ERCOT to process your switch request more quickly so that you can
receive the savings you expect from NewPower as soon as possible.

If you have any questions or concerns, please visit the Public Utility
Commission's website at
http://www.powertochoose.org
or call NewPower at 1-877-819-9817.


Regards,

Nick Utton

I am sending information to the printer this afternoon for our new brochure
and picture book for The Business Council.  I was wondering if we should
just list you as a Graduate member and list you as Former President &amp; CEO of
Enron Corp. and keep the same business address and phone numbers.  Please
let me know asap.

Thanks.

Just a quick little note. I would very much like to talk to you when you get
a chance.  My guess is that you will probably be taking some time off for
awhile.  When you do have some time, please give me a call.  I specialize in
the finance(VC and Investment Banks) arena and would love to present someone
of your caliber to them.  That is of course, if you are interested in
possibly going into that arena.

your financial advisors and have forged many relationships with
institutions, investors and brokers  to bring cutting edge tax ideas
together. KPMG's Personal Financial Planning is dedicated to developing tax
solutions for those interested in deferral, minimization , and mitigation of

Strategies.

As a side note,  I am sure you have know the Lay Family and Sharon and JT
have been friends of my parents and my husband and I for years through
sailing at the Yacht Club at Lakewood and HYC.

time, to share our Tax ideas with you. If so, have Joannie call me at my

  <content type="text" name="message">Dear Jeff,

In case you do not recall my name, I organized the Conference series for
PDVSA that hosted President Bush (41), Lou Noto, Harry Longwell, etc. in 96,
James A Baker III, et. al. in 97 and Robert Mosbacher , Jeff Skilling and
others in 98.

Anyway, today after reading the Wall Street Journal, it could appear
outright impertinent to contact you. I chose to believe exactly the
opposite. Attached you will find an invitation to an interesting energy/ IT
event. I think you will be able to judge the merits of attending on your
own. I would like to take this opportunity to wish you all the best in your
upcoming professional opportunities.

From: 	Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON [mailto:IMCEANOTES-Enron+20Announcements_Corp_Enron+40ENRON@ENRON.com]  On Behalf Of Ken Lay-@ENRON
Sent:	Tuesday, August 14, 2001 4:00 PM
To:	All Enron Worldwide@ENRON
Subject:	Organizational Announcement


It is with regret that I have to announce that Jeff Skilling is leaving Enron.  Today, the Board of Directors accepted his resignation as President and CEO of Enron.  Jeff is resigning for personal reasons and his decision is voluntary.  I regret his decision, but I accept and understand it.  I have worked closely with Jeff for more than 15 years, including 11 here at Enron, and have had few, if any, professional relationships that I value more.  I am pleased to say that he has agreed to enter into a consulting arrangement with the company to advise me and the Board of Directors.
Now it's time to look forward.
With Jeff leaving, the Board has asked me to resume the responsibilities of President and CEO in addition to my role as Chairman of the Board.  I have agreed.  I want to assure you that I have never felt better about the prospects for the company.  All of you know that our stock price has suffered substantially over the last few months.  One of my top priorities will be to restore a significant amount of the stock value we have lost as soon as possible.  Our performance has never been stronger; our business model has never been more robust; our growth has never been more certain; and most importantly, we have never had a better nor deeper pool of talent throughout the company.  We have the finest organization in American business today.  Together, we will make Enron the world's leading company.
On Thursday at 10:00 a.m. Houston time, we will hold an all employee meeting at the Hyatt.  We will broadcast the meeting to our employees around the world where technically available, and I look forward to seeing many of you there.</content>

As with the many employees here at Enron, I wish you all the best ahead. I'm sorry to hear you leave but I know you have your reasons. I'm sure
we all can respect that.

I just wanted to send you a note to say thanks again for the things you've done for me since last summer. They're greatly appreciated. Hopefully, I will have the chance to meet with you again.

Wishing you the best and hopefully I will see you again....

I just heard of your resignation. I wanted to personally "Thank You" for being such a positive influence for ALL the employees of Enron. You have always carried yourself as "Enron" and have helped placing a positive knowledge to the community of what Enron and its employee's truly are.

 I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors and in life in general. I am deeply saddened by this news that you are leaving, but can not help but feel happy for you. (as this was your decision)

May God Bless you.

  <content name="title" action="cluster">National Power Delivery Opportunities</content>
  <content type="text" name="message">
Dear Mr.. Skilling,
Given the current events of the last several years  regarding power generation and delivery across our nation, I have a  proposal, I'm sure will interest you. 
First, with your position with Enron, you must be keenly aware of the issues  that we face as a nation, and direct impact which the energy markets  have on our economic health.  Additionally, you must also be aware of the  capacity imbalance from region to region, lack of capital improvements  by the incumbent utilities, ISO's etc, all of which has created a situation that  our national grid is in a state of degradation, in which even the delivery and  transfer of existing capacity is questionable, must less the additional  generation which is being added. This has rendered our national grid, with its  many segmented regions to slightly above that of a third world nation. 
This lack of capital investment has been exacerbated by a lack of clear  direction by the vast number of regulatory bodies, and general lack of  aggressive entrepreneurial motivation and vision by the various utilities to  develop creative solutions to issues which they have a vested interest to  resolve, but haven't. It appears that there are vast  opportunities available to an aggressive, first mover organization which  can pull together the resources,  and bring all the players together along  with the capital markets to initiate, develop and build additional capacity or  to enhance the existing power delivery and transfer. 
While the Bush Energy Policy goes a long way towards bringing federal backing  to developing additional generation capacity, it appears to fall short regarding  the transmission systems that cross our nation,  of which many are already  straining under a heavy load, which is only anticipated to grow.   Additional transmission capacity must be built, including additional  interconnects between the various grids and/or existed interconnects  strengthened.  The ability to transfer power from the east coast to the  west coast, as the power demand peak moves across the country from the east, or  the ability to transfer power from such area's as Nova Scotia which has an  abundant supply of inexpensive Hydro Power would certainly be the ideal  situation.
What I propose, is the development of a new Enron company, of which its  vision would be to identify and develop opportunities to build various  transmission assets, and/or additional generation capacity or to strengthen  existing assets.  This would be accomplished by bringing various players  together under the Enron lead,  and working with the capital markets to  develop a strategy, allowing for the asset to be built. All the while keeping in  mind, the asset light and capital velocity approach. It would be the goal of  this new organization, not to own the physical asset, but to retain  the rights to a portion of its capacity. This capacity could then be  traded or used for power transfers from regions with inexpensive supplies to  areas that shortages exist.  I envision long term inexpensive contracts for  Nova Scotia hydropower; being transferred to such area's as New York,  the  Midwest, or even California.
While such an idea is not unique,  with several proposals   being considered by various organizations across our country. Such as the  following:

Path 15, long recognized as the major  transfer constraint between North and Southern California. Recently, WAPA has  issued a solicitation for equity participation, in which private organizations  could participate, in the financing, building  and ownership with  rights to its capacity. http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/EPA-IMPACT/2001/June/Day-13/i14874.htm 
Neptune Project a private initiative in the New England states being  proposed by a group of companies, mostly non-utility for except ABB. This  project has recently been approved by FERC and is currently soliciting bids  for capacity rights, ownership, etc. http://www.neptunerts.com/ 
 
TransAmerica Project another private  initiative being proposed by Black &amp; Vetch along with Siemens. The  scope of this project is to build a DC line between the east/west grids,  thereby allowing a transfer capacity increase to 6000 MW. This project has  already been presented to the National Energy Committee put together by  President Bush as a viable project and potential solution. http://www.bv.com/bv/news/pressrel/2001/bv_siemn.htm 

 
While great idea's are plentiful, the problem is funding from the capital  markets, or an organization with proven leadership and track record to pull  off such a project.
This is just the beginning, and given the historical lack of investment in  the grid, many more opportunities will had by an aggressive organization with  the foresight to put together the team to capture them as they come  available. I envision that this organization would work in conjunction with  TranConnect , which Portland General is currently a member, in order to expand  or compliment their efforts. 
It's my opinion and that of many others, that the only organization on this  planet, with the financial strength, entrepreneurial vision, superior management  along with political clout, to pull all the components together to make  this a success, is Enron. 
As a former Enron employee,  I am extremely familiar with a number of  the organizations, which make up Enron, and feel that this would certainly  compliment or augment existing operations.  
While I'm not with Enron as this time, I certainly am proud of the  contributions I made while with such a progressive organization and I am  extremely interested in meeting with you at your earliest convenience to discuss  this proposal and it's fit into overall Enron strategic plan. 
For further discussion, I can be contacted at (602) 758-4544 (Cell) 
Regards,
Mike Stefanik

  <content name="title" action="cluster">From FoxFire, To an MBA -- I've Come A Long Way</content>
  <content type="text" name="message">Mr. Skilling,

I realize this message may seem quite unexpected, but
I could not resist.  It's been a long time since I
knew you at FoxFire Cabins.  Since then I have
completed my undergraduate degree at Trinity
University and recently my MBA at the University of
Texas San Antonio.  In my current job search for a
marketing career, I found a marketing position open at
Enron and applied for it.  As I researched the
company, one that I have watched in the past because
of your connection, I saw that you are now President
and CEO.  Your success is quite remarkable.
I just wanted to re-introduce myself to you as an
adult and recent graduate and hope that somewhere in
the future there may be an opportunity to work at
Enron.  Also, as a very successful MBA yourself, I
welcome any advice you may provide a newcomer to the
business world.  Hope you are doing well with all your
endeavors.

Sincerely,
Leslye Kellner

Dear Mr Skilling,

Please forgive this interruption to your business day, but I thought it might be time I owned up before you found out from someone else.

A.  I saw you speak at the Tibco conference in Las Vegas and I was inspired.  I've been at Enron for over 5 years, and I think it's fantastic that we using the 'strategy' word more and more.

B. I stole your slides and re-used them for my own purposes.  I hope you don't mind.

C. I think I can see how to move forward with our technology team to build the kind of systems "structure" that goes some way to mimicking the capabilities inherent in your new business structure. 

I thought you might enjoy thumbing through "my" slides and notes.

Regards,
Richard.

  <content type="text" name="message">Mr. Skilling,  
Hello! My name is Tim Ng and I was a summer analyst the last 2 summers. Last  
August, I met with you for a few minutes in your office to talk and ask for  
advice. You told me to diversify my life experiences, as that can only help  
you throughout life. Like you, with your desire to fly planes, I decided to  
take a plane to travel around the world. In the last year, I studied abroad  
in Hong Kong, traveled to places such as China, Macau, Thailand, and  
Australia. After travelling, I see how doing different things, seeing  
different things can only enhance your total life experience.  
Tomorrow, I will return to Enron as a full-time Analyst. I look forward to  
this opportunity to learn more, and challenge myself, and hopefully, do new  
and different things to diversify my experiences.  
I thank you for taking the time to meet with me last summer. It really meant  
a lot to me, and your advice has really changed the way I go about things in  
life now.  
Perhaps one day, I can meet with you again. I know that your schedule can  
only be busier now, but hopefully I can see you during your talk with the new  
Analysts sometime in the next week or so.  
Take care and I hope to hear from you soon!  
Kindest regards,  
Tim Ng </content>

  <content type="text" name="message">

Dear Mr. Skilling,

On behalf of Mayor Willie L. Brown, Jr. (San Francisco), it is my
pleasure to invite you to meet with him regarding energy issues in
California.

Mayor Brown wishes to meet with you in his capacity as a trustee of the
Board of Administration of the California Public Employees Retirement
System (CalPERS).  As you know, CalPERS is the largest public pension fund
in the
nation and is a sizeable investor in domestic energy stocks, bonds,
debentures, etc.  The Board has appointed Mayor Brown to lead a
delegation of trustees to meet with the CEOs of CalPERS' largest energy
holdings.  Enron represents one such holding.

The Mayor would be pleased to host you in his office at the newly
renovated City Hall in San Francisco or arrange an alternative location at
your earliest convenience.  I
will await your response.

Sincerely,

Monique Moyer
Director, Mayor's Office of Public Finance
City &amp; County of San Francisco

  <content type="text" name="message">Mr Skilling,

Thank you for inviting me to participate in the last Executive Forum. It was very informative.  And it helped me 
to understand some of the corporate goals and issues more clearly. 

As I mentioned in that meeting,  I think the Xcelerator can be a key tool for leveraging our "soft" assets, as well 
as helping Enron develop new business models to lead it into the future.  I also think the Xcelerator
can play a key role in creating a balance between technology and commercial realities.  

---

To succeed in these goals,  it's obvious that the Xcelerator needs a very dynamic, strong leadership.  

I understand that a new COO has been hired and starts next week.  I think that this is a great way to introduce a good 
process &amp; structure to the Xcelerator quickly.

I also understand that you're looking for a CEO from within Enron.  I just learned this morning that John Echols
is moving out of EBS.  I believe that John would be a fantastic person to lead the Xcelerator.  John is an extremely 
bright and creative  person, who first visualizes the overall business model, and then works dilligently to achieve it.
John is well respected within Enron, and is viewed by everyone as a "neutral".  He would give the Xcelerator
the internal credibility it needs to succeed.

I'm excited about the opportunity of working with the Xcelerator regardless of who becomes the CEO.
I think it will become a great asset to Enron.


Thanks again for your time.

			-larry

Electricity Cost Data Spread the Blame Power: Many suppliers charged more
than the firms that Davis has pilloried, records show.

SACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more diverse
group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray Davis,
who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records
show.


During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretches of
power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and private
entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid
to Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by
the Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California.


Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per
megawatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San Diego Gas
& Electric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power, the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a
megawatt-hour charged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC
Hydro, to $292 an hour by the DWP.


In fact, some of the biggest private power companies singled out for
criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc., Duke Energy and
Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid for the period.
Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 per megawatt-hour,
according to an analysis of the documents.


The figures cover the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased
by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more
than a month of razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power
emergencies.


Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest
barbs at private out-of-state generators because, in general, they have
reaped the highest profits over the longest period.


"You have to look at the whole picture," Maviglio said.


"The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the
generators who wear cowboy hats," he said. "Their profits were 100% to 400%
above last year. . . . Just because there are other entities who are
charging us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact that we are
getting ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte."


The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times
on the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on California's
electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year's first
quarter.


The records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion buying power in
the first five months of the year, and underscore the complexity of the
state's energy problem. They also show that patterns of high prices are not
limited to a few generators.


Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the water resources agency, said that the
reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the
year. "All the prices were high," he said, noting the downward trend in
costs since his agency began buying power in mid-January.


The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purchases went from $316
in January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an average of $321 per
hour to $271, the reports show.


In the first quarter of the year, some public entities' prices far exceeded
those of the biggest private companies. For example, Houston-based Enron,
one of the nation's biggest power traders, charged an average of $181 per
megawatt-hour. And Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold the most to the state,
a total of $706 million, charged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour.


By contrast, a Calgary, Canada, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a
megawatt-hour, and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average
charges of $330 per megawatt-hour.


A spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said recently that the "vilification of
Enron was based on politics, not facts." Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not
be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the
past, the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered
last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on.


A spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric,
said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to
see the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be
reached Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of
producing the power needed by the state were extremely high.


More Power Bought Than Projected


Hidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agency's efforts,
coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas
prices, have begun to tame the state's market.


Still, the state had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May,
about 10% more than Davis' analysts had projected.


Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply
problems in April. He said reports will show that power purchases fell
short of state projections in June and early July.


The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June
and July, partly because spot prices have fallen sharply, often to well
under $100 a megawatt-hour.


A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday credited
Davis' program of nurturing new power generation and establishing long-term
power contracts with with "moving the California electric energy industry
closer to normalcy."

Dear Jeff,
 
I worked at McKinsey (NY/FI) during 1985-91 and have  since founded and run an IT systems integration company called Techna in Silicon  Valley, with clients worldwide and Purnendu ("PC") Chatterjee (ex McK and  affiliated with Soros' funds) as an equity partner. 
We have been working closely with Sempra Energy trading  for the past couple of years and are beginning an engagement with NYMEX soon.  Our president, Ben Bernstein (ex Microsoft) has been managing these clients on  the east coast personally. Ben and I feel that we have interesting ideas in IT  for Enron from our experience in this industry thus far, and would appreciate  your indulgence in getting us in touch with the appropriate IT leaders at Enron  for us to make a pitch. 
Your achievements at Enron since leaving McKinsey  have deservedly won you quite a fan following! As an unabashed member of  this group, I would love to hear from you anyway, when you find a moment in your  busy day.
Best regards.

  <content type="text" name="message">Mr. Skilling,

I am new to Enron (about 2 months) and I would like to say how pleased I was by your presentation to the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco last week.

Despite the obvious hostility you faced from some of the attendees, I felt you skillfully and professionally delivered a message that is very important for the people of California to hear.  If they listened to what you said, they should have learned a great deal and based on my listening to some of the audience during and after your presentation it seemed apparent that many of them did understand and accepted your message.

Keep voicing the same message, I know we in Government Affairs certainly will and I appreciate your support in light of the emotional environment the energy community currently finds itself operating.  I am sorry I wasn't able to meet you in our office in San Francisco prior to your address, perhaps another time. 

Kind Regards,

Dave Perrino</content>

  <content type="text" name="message">Dear Mr. Lay &amp; Mr. Skilling,

I cannot begin to express my gratitude to you and Enron for the $1000.00 I received.  My husband and I were devastated when our home flooded.  I was so proud to be an Enron employee when I heard that we had donated $500,000 to the flood relief fund.  But when I learned that we would be eligible for $1000 as flood victims, I could only burst into tears and thank God for working for such a humanitarian company.  I was a participant in the Fortune 500 survey last year and rated Enron as THE best place to work for! I truly believed it then and even more so now.  Thank you again for going above and beyond this employees' expectations.  We are truly grateful.

June 18, 2001 
Dear Mr. Skilling: 
  
I would like to explore the possibility of joining your organization as a  
senior technology executive.  
I have more than 16 years of experience, including 11 years as a senior  
executive: 3 years as Director of an academic R&D center at University of  
Maryland, 3 years as a Vice President of a systems-integration company, and 5  
years as a senior technology executive at US Department of Transportation  
(i.e., Chief Scientific and Technical Advisor). I do have hands-on experience  
in design, development, and implementation of advanced technologies,  
including complex products and processes, and introduction of automation  
technologies. I refer to the term "automation" as the process of designing,  
developing, and implementing all the relevant complementary  
(information-based) technologies and systems (i.e., software and hardware)  
that are required to speed up the process of performing a specific manual  
task.    
As a technology executive, I address IT and other relevant technology  
concerns from a holistic perspective, based on an open-system architecture,  
so that as the enterprise evolves, introduction of new technologies (i.e.,  
hardware, software, and communication systems)  would not inhibit future  
growth of the enterprise. I am also committed to proposing and implementing  
uniformly accepted international standards for development of new products  
and services (i.e., software, hardware, systems, and any combination of them)  
in order to guarantee quality and reliability of the products and services,  
accordingly. Furthermore, I am committed to assess and quantify the expected  
consequences (i.e., cost, schedule, performance, reliability and quality  
control concerns) associated with adoption of new technologies prior to  
selecting and committing to those technologies, so that future growth and  
financial revenues would not be unexpectedly interrupted due to emergence of  
more cost effective (competing) technologies elsewhere.  
My organization is responsible to independently monitor, evaluate, and  
officially certify aerospace products (i.e., hardware and software systems as  
well as the commercial aircraft, rotorcraft, and their parts) during design,  
manufacturing, and support phases of their life cycles, in the US and abroad.  
To address a subset of these concerns, I collaborate with the senior  
executive of the commercial aerospace industry and other US Departments and  
federal agencies, including Defense, NASA, and Commerce, and when necessary,  
I assist and advise them accordingly. In my official capacity, aside from my  
executive responsibilities, I monitor and assess the state of art IT,  
automation, and real-time quality assurance technologies in the aerospace  
sector and when necessary, I advise their senior executives accordingly.   
I am responsible to coordinate R&D activities of the FAA's National Centers  
of Excellence including: National Center of Excellence for Aviation  
Operations Research, Joint Center of Excellence in Computational Modeling of  
Aircraft Structures; and  Airworthiness Assurance Center of Excellence, while  
promoting government-industry-university sponsored research and education.  
Furthermore, I collaborate with DARPA and other federal agencies on  
assessment and development of advanced systems and telecommunication  
technologies, including wireless broadband telecommunication technologies  
(Particularly for avionics and real-time entertainment applications), Next  
Generation Internet (NGI), Network Management. I am also familiar with the  
underlying operations, manufacturing and quality control concerns  
corresponding to the life cycles of such products. I am a member of the  
National Science Academy's Transportation Research Board (TRB), and work  
closely with NASA's Ames center at Moffet-Field on advanced information and  
avionics systems for design, development, and prototyping of the next  
generation of advanced aviation support systems.I have also designed and  
implemented advanced web-enabled logistics systems, web-enabled Supply Chain  
Management systems, and web-enabled real-time quality control & surveillance  
systems.  
I have extensive outsourcing, procurement, and acquisition management  
experience in both private sector and the government in domains of  
information and communications systems, and have extensive hands-on  
experience with outsourcing and contracting. I have contributed to  
improvement of US Government's (multibillion $) aerospace acquisition  
management, and have contributed to revision and improvement of the FAA's  
acquisition management system for procurement of advanced information  
systems. I have also been instrumental in implementation of ISO standards in  
the aerospace sector. 
Please let me know if I can provide you with additional information. I can be  
reached either at (202) 965-3696 or (703) 593-4854. 
Thank you for your consideration. 
Sincerely, 
Ben Pourbabai

  <content type="text" name="message">
For Immediate Release  Friday, October 12, 2001 	Media Contact: Michael Mack Vice President of Business Development Phone: (202) 207-0540 michael.mack@votenet.com 	


Votenet Brings NAFSA's National Elections Online 

Firm formally launches eBallot software and consulting practice for associations and member-based organizations 

October 26, 2001, Washington, D.C. - Votenet Solutions, Inc. is pleased to announce its latest web-based software innovation, eBallot, which allows organization's members to vote online.  This easy-to-use, cost effective method of voting will change forever how private elections are conducted.  NAFSA (Association for International Educators http://www.nafsa.org) employed Votenet's technology as the sole voting mechanism during their recent 2002 national officer's election.  With 35 candidates running in twenty races internationally, NAFSA members were able to vote online for the first time in NAFSA's history.    
"As an international association with a dispersed membership, the benefits of Votenet's application are incalculable," says Denise Wold, Director of Membership Services, NAFSA, an organization of 6400 members. "The key to our success was the ease-of-use of the voting system.  Our members found the voting application to be intuitive and convenient.  Taking our election online allowed our members to view candidate profiles and vote in just a few minutes."  
Votenet's eBallot software provides: 
Convenient 24 hour a day online ballots integrated into the organization's website; 
Candidate biographies;  
Election management suite that enables election administrators to monitor voting and view real-time voting reports; 
Login security ensures one vote per eligible voter; 
Web-based application is scalable to handle any size election or referendum. 

Ideal for any organization with elected officials, Votenet's eBallot Software is not only secure, but it is easy-to-use and will aid in cutting mailing, labor, and other overhead costs involved with elections.  "Votenet's online election system saved time and money and will certainly benefit us in future election years," remarked Bill Newman, Chief Financial Officer at NAFSA.  "Any association or organization interested in slashing the financial and man-power costs associated with an election should consider working with Votenet to conduct a virtual election." 
"A large number of elections take place every year at national and international associations, businesses, charities, and unions.  Now to be able to perform that function, while also offering candidate biographies, a 'voting wizard' to aid voters, and real-time results, online is impressive. The time, trouble and cost associated with a traditional paper intensive election system makes Votenet's eBallot Software a very high ROI application for any organization with a large or geographically dispersed voting constituency," says Glen Hughlette, CEO and President of Votenet Solutions. 
The eBallot software is immediately available from Votenet Solutions.  Interested groups can learn how to license the software by calling a sales representative at 1-800-VOTENET ext. 513

  <content type="text" name="message">On another note, as a worldwide activity, our resid business is up $12 million this year, and it is something on which we clearly need to focus.  We have a poor history as a company in this area, but it is a business we know is important to our success.  You'll hear more about our additional resources in marketing and risk management in this area.

Have a great weekend.

I'm sure this is just a "misunderstanding", but I know that UBS Capital has spent innumerable hours with management.  While Mark says that he doesn't want LJM to have an advantage, it looks like LJM is being put at a disadvantage.  You would think that Cliff and Mark would welcome a new bidder with open arms after failing to sell this business for 2+ years.  Until this is resolved, I'll assume that LJM is out of the bidding and will not do any further work.  Enron is back to one bidder (the lower one) -- better for our company ???

Andy - Mark Metts called tonight and has asked me not to meet with you in Houston tomorrow.  His stated concern is over disparate/more favorable treatment of you (LJM) as opposed to other bidders for EWC.  As we have discussed, while I am very interested in an LJM financed MBO, at this stage I need you to sort out any process issues with Cliff/Mark and/or Jeff.  Let's meet as soon as that gets worked out.  In the meantime, I won't travel to Houston Monday but will call to chat.  Thanks. Adam</content>

My name is Tom Mashington and I'm a Construction Project Manager for EES in their Philadelphia office. A few weeks ago, I received in the mail a Enron newsletter which contained a feature of you and your interests. While reading the article, I noticed that you're into "Anything Africa." Two years ago, I was working in Ghana, West Africa on a cogen plant with Stone &amp; Webster. Most US. citizens have no idea what the conditions are like in these 3rd world countries. 
I was curious as to how many trips you've made to the sub-Saharan section of the continent and to which countries you have visited.
Earlier, I was discussing my African experience with Marty Sunde. I sent him a few ebony wood carvings purchased from the local villagers. These pieces were hand carved by artisans in the area.  If you have a moment, you should stop by his office on the 8th floor where he has them on display.
I have also attached the files containing a few digital photo's from the area where I lived and worked. These are primarily photos from the local villages near the plant.
While you're viewing the photos, you should be able to recognize me. I'm the only American looking individual in the tribe.
Enjoy

Tom Mashington

  <content type="text" name="message">Jeff:

Thank you for agreeing to spend a few minutes on Tuesday, April 17 with Moody's Investor Service.  You are scheduled to speak at noon in room EB50M.  To put the day into context, Moody's will have heard prior to your session presentations from Andy and Ben on 2000 results, Mike McConnell on Global Markets, and Jeff McMahon on Wholesale Services.  Our afternoon session will include presentations from Dan Leff on EES, Rod Hayslett on ETS, Kevin Hannon on EBS and Rick Buy on RAC.

In attendance from Moody's will be (in order of rank) Mike Foley - Group Managing Director, John Diaz - Managing Director, and Stephen Moore - Relationship Manager (our analyst).  Diaz and Moore are very familiar with the Enron credit profile.  Foley is their boss.  He apparently is the leader of their ratings committee.  He has not historically attended our meetings.

Key messages for you to hit (which will have already been touched upon by Andy and reinforced throughout the day) include:

Enron's core businesses - have never been better.  We are the market leader in gas and power by a wide margin;
Portland General - we will ultimately divest of this entity and are disappointed that the Sierra Pacific transaction was derailed by regulatory hurdles.  However, PG provides considerable, stable cash flows;
International Asset Sales - we are still committed to liquidating our interests in low returning investments.  Market problems have delayed our M&amp;A effort but we expect movement in the next 12-24 months;
Credit Profile is critical to core businesses - we protect our credit rating as a matter of corporate policy.  Our asset sale and corresponding capital redeployment strategy is based in part to allow us to either reduce leverage or to invest in areas with stronger cash flows thereby improving our key coverage ratio;  and 
Issue Resolution Ongoing - we have some issues (such as California, Dabhol, and Azurix) which are important and are receiving the attention of top management.  They will be covered by Ben and Rick Buy's group.  The main message is that they are not representative of our core business.

If you have any questions, please call me at x31770 or (713) 962-4013 (cell phone).

Thanks,
Tim

  <content name="title" action="cluster">MS150 interview for A/A Encounter</content>
  <content type="text" name="message">Jeff,

My name is Samuel Pak, and I'm an Analyst in the A/A program.  I will also be riding the MS150 with you and the Team this weekend.  As I did last year, I am writing an article on the MS150 for the Encounter.  As such, I was hoping that maybe we could chat a few minutes at lunch in Bellville or at dinner in La Grange.  If this is OK with you, I will find you and introduce myself, and we can go from there.

Much Thanks!
Sam.
