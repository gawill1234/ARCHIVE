<TR VALIGN="bottom">
<TD COLSPAN="5" VALIGN="top">The clustering should always behave in a &quot;reasonable way&quot;. You may be referring to the following case. Two top categories A (let's say &quot;France&quot; 25 docs) and B (let's say &quot;Paris&quot;, 12 docs) sharing 9 documents, these 9 documents are likely to appear under A in a cluster named B, but NOT appear under B in a cluster named A. The reason is that at each level, the clustering uses the contextual information: under A it is useful information to know that a document is about B, but under B 75% of the documents are about A and it is likely that the clustering will not consider A a worthy sub-category of B. So you may end up with &quot;France (25) &gt; Paris (9)&quot;, and &quot;Paris (12) &gt; Museum (3), Hotels (3), Tour (3), Texas (3)&quot; instead of &quot;Paris (12) &gt; France (9), Texas (3)&quot;. </TD>

On the other hand, &quot;risperdal&quot; can not be both rephrased to &quot;risperdone&quot; AND &quot;J&amp;J drug&quot;, this would need to be done with &quot;evoke&quot;.</TD>

<TD VALIGN="top">Boolean Statements</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">Meta-search does not accept simple boolean statements, often yielding in an error or no result. Sometimes the boolean statement is misinterpreted e,g. 'prostate cancer OR prostatic neoplasm' was translated to 'prostatic (neoplasm OR prostate)'. Often boolean 'AND' is interpreted as 'OR'. It is mandatory that at least ' AND' and 'OR' are interpreted correctly.</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">The lack of using boolean operators severly limits the options of a searcher to increase retrieval precision</TD>
<TD ALIGN="center" VALIGN="top">2</TD>
</TR>
<TR VALIGN="bottom">
<TD COLSPAN="5" VALIGN="top">As stated above, AND and OR can be supported. This requires a precise description of the syntax supported by the search engines queried. For example, Vivisimo was hooked up to Convera using the default &quot;concept search&quot; for which it was unclear if it was an &quot;any&quot; or &quot;all&quot; search. The interpretation of precedences and input form syntax needs to be aggreed on (the interpretation of OR described above matches the Google syntax), Vivisimo can support any type of input syntax (and even mutliple ones).</TD>

<TD VALIGN="top">Fielded Search</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">Can existing attributes be utilized in search? If yes, can it be done so it is transparent to the user, which source has these attributes and supports searching them and which one does not?</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">Without fielded search formal attributes (author, trial number, title) cannot be searched effectively</TD>
<TD ALIGN="center" VALIGN="top">1</TD>
</TR>
<TR VALIGN="bottom">
<TD COLSPAN="5" VALIGN="top">This is definitely supported by the Content Integrator. Any set of fields can be defined (new fields can be created at will), each of them can be made &quot;critical&quot;, so that only the sources supporting it will be queried whenever the user specifies it.</TD>

<TD ALIGN="center" VALIGN="top">1</TD>
</TR>
<TR VALIGN="bottom">
<TD COLSPAN="5" VALIGN="top">Vivisimo gives deterministic results. This can only be due to timeouts (in which case the given source returns partial results or no results). The user can be notified of such timeout and proposed to rerun the query with a higher timeout. Also, Vivisimo offers the option to cache the results.</TD>
</TR>
<TR VALIGN="bottom">
<TD VALIGN="top">** 4</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">Time-out Problem</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top"> Can time-out be configured? We were told to disable the search in some sources, but this is of course no solution. Convera is slow when it comes to searching PDFs, this is a known issue that cannot be resolved. PDFs are, however, a substantial part of the document collection.</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">Some business critical sources cannot be searched.</TD>
<TD ALIGN="center" VALIGN="top">1</TD>
</TR>
<TR VALIGN="bottom">
<TD COLSPAN="5" VALIGN="top">Timeout can be configured (per source or for all sources). The reason why we asked you to disable some of the sources was that the CONVERA search engine was never returning for these sources (INDEPENDENTLY of Vivisimo), using 100% CPU on the machine and needed to be restarted.</TD>
</TR>
<TR VALIGN="bottom">
<TD VALIGN="top">** 5</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">Proximity of words</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">Proximity of words does not impact the search result ranking in a way that documents with the search terms in closer proximity are also ranked higher. Same is true for clustering of the result</TD>
