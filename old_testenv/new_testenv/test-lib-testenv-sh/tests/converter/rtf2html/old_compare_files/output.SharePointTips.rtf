<p>
<i><b>For the latest information, please see the  on Microsoft Office Online.</b></i><p>
<h1>Introduction</h1><i><b>These Tips and Tricks show how to perform a number of basic tasks in a Microsoft® Office SharePoint™ Portal Server 2003 environment. They can help you learn to use SharePoint Portal Serverand will introduce you to the basic features and principles of portal site navigation and customization. This document is intended to be a desktop reference, but it can also form the basis for self-paced or instructor-led training. </b></i><p>
<i><b>Some SharePoint Portal Server features, such as My Sites and the ability to create new SharePoint sites, may not be available due to your company’s IT policies. SharePoint Portal Server security can be used to limit the actions that each user can perform. In many cases, you need the correct rights in order to perform certain tasks. Check with your IT department for clarification of individual issues.</b></i><p>
<h1>Create a New SharePoint Site</h1><i><b>SharePoint Portal Server makes it easy to create SharePoint sites. SharePoint sites can serve a variety of purposes, such as the team Web site for a particular team or division, or for collaboration on a particular task or project. These steps show you how to create a SharePoint site from within the portal site.</b></i><p>
<h2>Create a New Site</h2>1. <i><b>On your portal site home page, click Sites. The Site Directory, a list of the different sites contained in the portal site, appears.</b></i><p>
2. <i><b>In the Actions list, click Create Site. The New SharePoint Site page appears.</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>Creating a new SharePoint site</b></i><p>
3. <i><b>In the Title box, type your new site’s name. It should be a short, descriptive name that makes it easy for others to find your site.</b></i><p>
4. <i><b>In the Description box, type a brief description of your site. It should explain who uses the site, and what kind of content people can expect to find there.</b></i><p>
5. <i><b>In the Web Site Address section, in the URL name section, of the area, type your site’s Web address. The name of the Web server where your site will be created is already filled out. Beside that, a drop-down menu lists one or more subareas for site creation. If there are multiple choices, ask your IT department which one to select.</b></i><p>
6. <i><b>In the Your E-mail Address section, type your e-mail address. This designates you as the owner of the site. As such, you may receive administrative information from the IT department and user requests for access to the site in addition to suggestions or questions from site visitors.</b></i><p>
7. <i><b>Click Create.</b></i><p>
<h2>Add Your Site to the Site Directory and Portal Site Search</h2><i><b></b></i><i><b> </b></i><p>
<i><b>Adding a site to the Site Directory</b></i><p>
1. <i><b>If you want to list your new site in the Site Directory, ensure that the List this site in the site directory check box is selected in the Site Link section on the Add Link to Site page. Only users with permission to access your site will see it listed in the directory. If you do not want your site listed in the directory, clear the List this site in the site directory check box. It is still there, but now only you can see it.</b></i><p>
2. <i><b>The Title, URL, and Description boxes contain the data you entered previously. If you want to make any changes, you can do so now.</b></i><p>
3. <i><b>If you want to list the site owner’s name in the Site Directory, type your name in the Owner box. If you are not the site owner, type the site owner’s name. This field tells people who is in charge of the site. </b></i><p>
4. <i><b>If you want to categorize your site by specific criteria, such as company division or region, click the appropriate list. For example, to categorize by division, select a division from the Division list. These categories, which are determined and configured by your IT department, make it easier for people to find your site.</b></i><p>
5. <i><b>If you want to spotlight your site, bringing it to the attention of general portal site users, select the Spotlight Site check box. A spotlight site is featured in the Site Directory and in relevant searches. Typically, you want to make a site a spotlight site only if it is the most important site for a common organizational term such as a category, product, business unit, etc.</b></i><p>
6. <i><b>If you want your site included in search results when people search for information through the portal site, select the Include in search results check box in the Search Results section.</b></i><p>
7. <i><b>If you want to specify a location within the portal site for your site, you can do so at this point. The location determines how your site is organized within the portal site’s navigation structure. You should choose a location that makes sense for your site, so it is easy for others to find it by going through the portal site. In most cases, a new site is created in a default location chosen by your IT Staff. This location is usually the best choice for new sites. </b></i><p>
<i><b>If you must change this location, click the Change Location link, and then follow these steps:</b></i><p>
a. <i><b>The Change Location properties page appears. To expand an area, click the plus sign (+) next to that area. There are no areas under the listing if the plus sign changes to a minus sign (-) without listing any subareas.</b></i><p>
b. <i><b>Select the check box next to the name of the area or subarea in which you want to locate your site.</b></i><p>
c. <i><b>Click OK.</b></i><p>
<i><b>Note</b></i><i><b>If you pick a location for which you don’t have the correct rights, your site may not appear immediately because the manager of that area must first approve your site.</b></i><p>
<p>
<b><p>
</b><i><b>Selecting a location for your SharePoint site</b></i><p>
8. <i><b>When you finish, click OK.</b></i><p>
<h2>Choose a Template for your Site</h2><i><b>When you create a SharePoint site, you must choose a template for that site. Each template contains features and functionality appropriate to a particular purpose or task.</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>Choosing a template for your SharePoint site</b></i><p>
1. <i><b>Under Template, select a template for your site. This list may include custom templates created by your IT department. When you select a template, an explanation of that template appears in the Select a Template area. The list may include:</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Team Site</b></i><i><b>. This is a very flexible type of Web site pre-populated with a variety of features for collaborating, sharing and publishing information. This template is a good choice for a wide variety of purposes. </b></i><p>
? <i><b>Blank Site</b></i><i><b>. This is a SharePoint site that is not pre-populated with tools. Choose this template if you intend to do most of the design and customization of the site yourself.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Document Workspace</b></i><i><b>. This is a SharePoint site pre-populated with tools related to document collaboration. </b></i><p>
? <i><b>Basic Meeting Workspace</b></i><i><b>. This is a SharePoint site pre-populated with tools related to meeting tasks.</b></i><p>
2. <i><b>After you select your template, click OK. Your new site automatically opens in the browser.</b></i><p>
<h2>Next Steps for Your New Site</h2><i><b>After you create your SharePoint site, there are a number of tasks you can perform to prepare it for your users. These tasks include:</b></i><p>
<b>? </b><b><i>Adding Users and Rights to your Site</i><p>
</b>? <i><b>After you create your site, you must add users and assign them rights. Rights determine what actions users can perform on your site. For example, you may want to allow some users to publish and edit documents, but allow others only to read documents. For more information on this task, see “Add Users and Rights to your Hosted SharePoint Site” later in this white paper.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Creating Document Libraries and Information Lists</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Optional backward-compatible document libraries and other types of lists make it easy to publish useful information on your site. You can use document libraries to store documents of interest to site users. You can also easily create lists, such as contact lists, announcements, events, links, etc.</b></i><p>
<b>? </b><b><i>Creating and Customizing Web Part Pages</i><p>
</b>? <i><b>Web Part Pages are special Web pages that can contain modular pieces of data or functionality called Web Parts. Web Parts can be used for a variety of tasks—from publishing lists and information to providing access to line-of-business applications or data. You can create Web Part Pages within your site and add Web Parts to those pages from within your Web browser.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Customizing the Look and Feel of your Site</b></i><i><b> </b></i><p>
? <i><b>There are a number of ways to customize the look and feel of your SharePoint site. You can use the browser to make some customizations, such as changing your site’s logo and applying a theme to the site. For more advanced customizations, such as those involving lists and Web Parts, you can use Microsoft Office FrontPage® 2003.</b></i><p>
<p>
<h1>Add Users and Rights to your Hosted SharePoint Site</h1><i><b>SharePoint sites use site groups to help manage security. Users are assigned to site groups to grant them a customizable set of rights appropriate to the tasks they need to perform. For example, the Reader group is for users who can view content on the site, but should not be allowed to edit it. The Contributor group is for users who are allowed to edit content, but do not have total administrative control over the site.</b></i><p>
<i><b>Note</b></i><i><b>You can add users to only one site group at a time. In this exercise, add only users who will be in the same site group. You can add users to additional site groups later.</b></i><p>
1. <i><b>On the top-level toolbar on your SharePoint site home page, click Site Settings. The Site Settings page opens.</b></i><p>
2. <i><b>In the Administration section, click Manage users.</b></i><p>
<b><p>
</b><i><b>Managing users on a SharePoint site</b></i><p>
3. <i><b>You can add, remove, and manage users on the Manage Users page. To add users, click Add Users.</b></i><p>
<b><p>
</b><i><b>Adding users to a SharePoint site</b></i><p>
4. <i><b>You can add users—singly or in groups—on the Add Users page. Type the user names or group names of those you want to add to your site. If you have any questions about which users and groups you can add to your site, contact your IT department.</b></i><p>
5. <i><b>If Microsoft Office Outlook® 2003 is installed on your computer, you can also use your Outlook address book to find and add users. To do this, complete the following steps:</b></i><p>
a. <i><b>On the Add Users page, click Address Book.</b></i><p>
b. <i><b>If you are prompted to select an Outlook profile, select the appropriate profile, and then click OK.</b></i><p>
c. <i><b>In the Microsoft Address Book dialog box, add users by double-clicking their names. Their names appear in the To box.</b></i><p>
 <p>
<i><b>Adding users to a SharePoint site with Address Book</b></i><p>
d. <i><b>When you finish, click OK.</b></i><p>
e. <i><b>You may see a security warning. If you do, select the Allow access for check box, select 1 minute from the list, and then click Yes. The e-mail addresses you selected appear in the Users box.</b></i><p>
6. <i><b>When you add users, you must choose in which site group to include them. Site groups provide similar rights to groups of users. Each site group includes a short description next to it. Specify the access level you want to give these users by selecting the appropriate check box under Site groups, and then clicking Next.</b></i><p>
<i><b>Note</b></i><i><b>You can add users to only one site group at a time. You can add users to additional site groups later.</b></i><p>
7. <i><b>You can now confirm the users you want to add and send them an introductory email. First, in the Confirm Users section, ensure that the users and groups listed are those you want to add to the site. If not, click Back and make any necessary changes.</b></i><p>
8. <i><b>If you want to send an introductory e-mail, follow these steps:</b></i><p>
a. <i><b>In the Send E-mail section, select the Send the following e-mail to let these users know they've been added check box.</b></i><p>
b. <i><b>Type an appropriate subject line in the Subject box. </b></i><p>
c. <i><b>Type a message in the Body box. This message should explain to which site the users have been added, why they have been added, and how to find the site.</b></i><p>
9. <i><b>When you are done, click Finish. The new users are listed on the Manage Users page.</b></i><p>
10. <i><b>To add users to other site groups, repeat these steps for the each additional site group.</b></i><p>
<p>
<h1>Alerts</h1><i><b>Alerts are notifications that tell you when a particular piece of information on the portal site has changed or when new information has been added. You can receive alerts about pages, lists of information, document libraries, individual documents, news, and search results. You can receive alerts by e-mail, either individually or in a periodic summary. If your organization uses My Sites—which allows users to have a personal portal site—you can also view your current alerts there.</b></i><p>
<h2>Alert for a Particular Page</h2>1. <i><b>Using Microsoft Internet Explorer, go to the page containing information you are interested in. </b></i><p>
2. <i><b>In the Actions list, click Alert Me. The Add Area Alert page opens.</b></i><p>
<b><p>
</b><i><b>Adding an area to My Alerts</b></i><p>
3. <i><b>In the Title section, type a title for your alert or keep the automatically created default title. </b></i><p>
4. <i><b>In the Delivery Options section, you can specify how you are notified about changes to this area.</b></i><p>
5. <i><b>If you want alerts concerning this area included in your alerts summary, select the My Alerts Summary check box.</b></i><p>
6. <i><b>If you want to receive e-mail alerts, select the E-mail address check box next to your e-mail address.</b></i><p>
7. <i><b>If you want to receive e-mail alerts, you can specify the frequency of alerts by selecting one of the options under the E-mail address check box. These include immediate, daily, and weekly summaries.</b></i><p>
8. <i><b>You may also set the advanced options for your alerts by clicking the Advanced Options link. Advanced options allow you to ask for alerts only when particular events occur (such as when new items are added or when existing items change). You can also filter your alerts so that you receive alerts only on particular items.</b></i><p>
9. <i><b>Click OK.</b></i><p>
<h2>View My Alerts</h2><i><b>SharePoint Portal Server allows users to have personal portal sites, where they can gather and publish information of interest. Your personal portal site, or My Site, contains a summary of all your alerts.</b></i><p>
1. <i><b>While viewing a page in the portal site, click My Site. A summary of your alerts appears. </b></i><p>
2. <i><b>Under My Alerts Summary, click Go to My Alerts page. The My Alerts page opens.</b></i><p>
<b><p>
</b><i><b>My Alerts page</b></i><p>
3. <i><b>This page gives more in-depth information about your alerts and allows you to manage them. You can use this page to activate or deactivate alerts, to delete alerts, and to view the contents of an alert.</b></i><p>
<p>
<h1>Create a New Document Library or Information List  </h1><i><b>Microsoft® SharePoint™ Products and Technologies provide lists to publish different types of information. This can include contact lists, lists of links, announcements, document libraries, etc. </b></i><p>
<i><b>Both SharePoint Portal Server and Microsoft® Windows® SharePoint™ Services allow you to create lists and libraries. This section explains how to create a new list on a SharePoint Portal Server portal site. The steps for creating lists on a team Web site, workspace, or other site using Windows SharePoint Services may differ slightly, but the process is essentially the same.</b></i><p>
<h2>Create a New List</h2><i><b>In this example, you create a new list of links. The steps for creating other types of lists may differ slightly, but the process is essentially the same.</b></i><p>
1. <i><b>Using Internet Explorer, go to the page where you want to create a new list.</b></i><p>
2. <i><b>In the Actions list, click Manage Content.</b></i><p>
3. <i><b>On the Documents and Lists page, click Create.</b></i><p>
<b><p>
</b><i><b>Creating a new list</b></i><p>
<i><b>A catalog of lists, pages, and discussion boards that you can create appears. Each category includes a brief explanation of its use.</b></i><p>
<i><b>Note</b></i><i><b>Each type of list is slightly different; and, furthermore, lists can be extended beyond their default customization. Follow the instructions in your browser when creating different types of lists. Nevertheless, the process of creating and customizing lists is essentially the same.</b></i><p>
4. <i><b>On the Create Page page, click Links. The New List page opens.</b></i><p>
5. <i><b>In the Name and Description section, in the Name box, type a simple name for your list of links. The name should make clear what type of information the list contains.</b></i><p>
6. <i><b>In the Description box, type a longer description of your list.</b></i><p>
7. <i><b>Click Create.</b></i><p>
<h2>Add Items to Your List</h2><i><b>After you create your list, you can add information to it. In this example, you add one item at a time to the list of links you just created. The steps for adding information to other types of lists may vary slightly.</b></i><p>
1. <i><b>When you create a new list, the management page for that list appears. In the list toolbar, click New Item.</b></i><p>
<b><p>
</b><i><b>Creating a new link in a list of links</b></i><p>
2. <i><b>In the URL box, type the Web address for the first item in the list.</b></i><p>
3. <i><b>In the Type the description box, type a brief description of the link.</b></i><p>
4. <i><b>If you want to include additional information, type it in the Notes box.</b></i><p>
5. <i><b>Click Save and Close. You can edit this item by clicking the Edit link next to the list item.</b></i><p>
6. <i><b>Repeat these steps as many times as necessary to add more items to the list.</b></i><p>
<h1>Edit a List in Datasheet View</h1><i><b>A list on a SharePoint site can have multiple views. Each view is customized for a particular audience or task. Datasheet view is a good way to rapidly add items to your lists. Datasheet view makes it easy for list managers to edit and customize lists, for example, when they are adding a large number of items to a list at one time. </b></i><p>
<i><b>In this exercise, use datasheet view to add items to a list of links. Editing other types of lists may require steps that vary slightly from those shown here.</b></i><p>
1. <i><b>Using Internet Explorer, go to the page that contains the list you want to manage.</b></i><p>
2. <i><b>In the Actions list, click Manage Content.</b></i><p>
<i><b>A list of all the lists you can manage in the current area appears on the Documents and Lists page. Click the list you want to edit. For example, to edit the Links list, click its name. The management page for the list appears. </b></i><p>
<i><b>List management page </b></i><p>
<i><b>On this page, click Edit in Datasheet. The datasheet view for this list appears. </b></i><p>
<b><i>Editing a list in datasheet view</i><p>
</b>3. <i><b>To add an item, type the new item in the blank row at the bottom of your list. The list expands as you type.</b></i><p>
4. <i><b>If you want to change the order of items in your list, click Change Order. The Change Item Order page appears. To change the order of an item, click the Position from Top list next to the column name, and then select the new value. When you finish, click OK. </b></i><p>
5. <i><b>If you want to activate a Totals column on your list, click Totals. Click this button again to disable the Totals column.</b></i><p>
6. <i><b>If you want to perform more advanced operations, click Task Pane on the toolbar. This task pane allows you to cut, paste, and manage filters for your list. It also allows you to move data between your list and Office2003 applications. To close the task pane, click Task Pane again.</b></i><p>
7. <i><b>If you want to refresh the data in your list, click Refresh Data at any time.</b></i><p>
8. <i><b>To return to the list management page, click Show in Standard View.</b></i><p>
<h1>Edit Columns on an Information List </h1><i><b>A list can have one or more columns that organize the information in the list. You can add a new column to the list and change the order in which the columns appear. </b></i><p>
<h2>Access the Customization Menu</h2><i><b>In this example, you customize the list of sites included with SharePoint Portal Server. The steps to customize a different list may vary slightly from those described here.</b></i><p>
1. <i><b>Using Internet Explorer, go to the page that contains the list you want to customize.</b></i><p>
2. <i><b>In the Actions list, click Manage Content. A directory of all the lists and information in the current area appears.</b></i><p>
3. <i><b>Find the list you want to customize and click on its name. For example, to customize the Sites list, click Sites. The list management page opens.</b></i><p>
4. <i><b>In the Actions list, click Modify settings and columns. The Customize page opens. The page includes a number of ways to customize the list.</b></i><p>
<b><p>
</b><i><b>Customizing a list</b></i><p>
 <p>
<h2>Add a Column to a List</h2><i><b>Lists can include a number of columns containing information. For example, a list of links will typically contain columns for the name, URL, and description of the links. In this exercise, we create a new column.</b></i><p>
1. <i><b>To add a column to the list, in the Columns section, click Add a new column.</b></i><p>
<b><p>
</b><i><b>Columns area of Customize list page</b></i><p>
2. <i><b>In the Name and Type section, in the Column name box, type a descriptive name for the column.</b></i><p>
3. <i><b>Under The type of information in this column is, select the most appropriate type of data. This should match the kind of information you or other users are expected to enter in this column.</b></i><p>
4. <i><b>In the Optional Settings for Column section, in the Description box, type a brief description of this column.</b></i><p>
5. <i><b>If the column contains mandatory information for an entry on this list, click Yes under Require that this column contains information. Users will be able to save a record to the list only if all the mandatory columns contain information.</b></i><p>
6. <i><b>After you choose the type of information, the Optional Settings for Column section is populated with choices relevant to this column. These options depend on the type of data the column contains. For example, if you add a date column, you are asked what date and time format the column should use.</b></i><p>
7. <i><b>If you want to add this column to the default view for this list, select the Add to default view check box.</b></i><p>
8. <i><b>Click OK. Your column is now listed in the Columns section on the Customize page.</b></i><p>
<h2>Reorder the Columns in a List </h2><i><b>You can also change the order in which the columns appear in your list.</b></i><p>
1. <i><b>In the Columns section, click Change the order of the fields.</b></i><p>
<b><p>
</b><i><b>Changing column order in a list</b></i><p>
2. <i><b>On the Change Field Order page, click the Position from Top list next to the field you want to move, and then select the item’s new position. </b></i><p>
3. <i><b>The order of the other fields changes to match your new selection. Repeat step2 as many times as necessary to order the list the way you want. </b></i><p>
4. <i><b>When you finish, click OK.</b></i><p>
<h1>Create a New View of a List</h1><i><b>In this example, you create a new view of the Links list. Creating a new view of other types of lists may require slightly different steps from those shown here.</b></i><p>
1. <i><b>Using Internet Explorer, go to the page that contains the list you want to modify.</b></i><p>
2. <i><b>In the Actions list, click Manage Content. A list of all the lists in the current area appears. Find the list you want to customize, and click its name. For example, to open the Links list, click Links. </b></i><p>
3. <i><b>In the Actions list, click Modify settings and columns to open the Customize page.</b></i><p>
<b><p>
</b><i><b>Customizing a list page</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>Customizing views on a list page</b></i><p>
4. <i><b>On the Customize page, under Views, click Create a new view.</b></i><p>
5. <i><b>The Create View page displays types of views to choose from. Click Standard View.</b></i><p>
<b><p>
</b><i><b>Creating a new view</b></i><p>
6. <i><b>In the Name section, in the View Name box, type a simple, easily identifiable name for your view.</b></i><p>
7. <i><b>If you want this to be the default view for the list, select the Make this the default view check box.</b></i><p>
8. <i><b>In the Audiences section, you can choose to create a personal view for your own use or a public view for anyone to use. Select the appropriate option.</b></i><p>
9. <i><b>In the Columns section, you can manage the columns of your view. This area lists all the possible data columns that can be displayed in your view. If you want a column to be displayed, select the Display check box next to that column’s name.</b></i><p>
10. <i><b>You can also adjust the order of the columns. To change the order of a column, click the Position from Left list next to the column name, and then select the new value. The other lists automatically change to accommodate your new selection.</b></i><p>
11. <i><b>In the Sort section, you can change how the list is sorted in your view. If you want to allow other users to sort this view according to their own criteria, check Yes under Allow users to order items in this view.</b></i><p>
12. <i><b>You can sort by up to two columns. To create a sort order:</b></i><p>
a. <i><b>To choose the first column to sort, select a column from the First sort by the column list.</b></i><p>
b. <i><b>To specify how the list is sorted, select Show items in ascending order or Show items in descending order. </b></i><p>
c. <i><b>If you want to sort by more columns, repeat these steps.</b></i><p>
13. <i><b>If you want to filter the view, select the Show items only when the following is true option in the Filter section. You can then create a criterion for your filter. For example, in order to show only items created after a certain date, complete the following steps:</b></i><p>

<h1>Add or Remove Web Parts from a Web Part Page</h1><i><b>Web Parts are modular, reusable portions of a Web page that provide tools or information. SharePoint Web sites use special Web pages called Web Part Pages to contain Web Parts. Users or Web designers can add or remove parts from these pages, and customize the layout of a Web Parts Page.</b></i><p>
<h2>Add a Web Part to a Page</h2><i><b>These steps describe the process for adding a Web Part to a Web Part Page in SharePoint Portal Server. The steps for performing this task on a Windows SharePoint Services site may be slightly different.</b></i><p>
1. <i><b>Using Internet Explorer, go to the Web Part Page you want to customize.</b></i><p>
2. <i><b>In the Actions list, click Edit page.</b></i><p>
3. <i><b>In the upper right side of the page, click Modify Shared Page, point to Add Web Parts, and then click Browse. The Add Web Parts pane opens.</b></i><p>

4. <i><b>Under Select the gallery you would like to browse, click the Web Part gallery with the same name as your SharePoint portal site. The number of Web Parts in each gallery appears in parentheses next to the gallery name. When you select a gallery, a list of Web Parts appears under Web Part List. </b></i><p>
<b><p>
</b><i><b>Adding Web Parts to a Web Part Page</b></i><p>
5. <i><b>There are a number of Web Part zones on the page. Each zone is labeled with the zone name above it in gray, such as Top Zone, Middle Left Zone, etc. Drag and drop your Web Part into one of these zones to add it to the page. For example, to add a document library to the page, click on Document Library and drag it into one of the Web Part zones on the page. The Web Part List shows only a certain number of the Web Parts in your gallery. If you do not see the Web Part you want, click Next to see additional Web Parts.</b></i><p>
6. <i><b>Alternately, you can add the Web Part by clicking the Add to list, selecting a Web Part zone, and clicking Add.</b></i><p>
7. <i><b>Click the X at the top of the Add Web Part pane to close it. Your Web Part appears on the page.</b></i><p>
<h2>Close a Web Part</h2><i><b>You can close a Web Part that you do not want to appear on the page. This does not delete the Web Part permanently, but simply removes it from the display. This is useful for customizing the appearance of a page without permanently deleting Web Parts that may contain useful data. Close a Web Part by following these steps:</b></i><p>
1. <i><b>In the Actions list, click Edit Page.</b></i><p>
<i><b>Note</b></i><i><b>If you see View Page in the Actions list, you are in edit mode.</b></i><p>
2. <i><b>On the upper right corner of the Web Part you wish to remove, click the down arrow.</b></i><p>
3. <i><b>Select Close.</b></i><p>
<h2>Delete a Web Part</h2><i><b>Sometimes you do not want to simply remove a Web Part from a page, but to delete it permanently. This completely deletes the Web Part and any data it contains. Delete a Web Part by following these steps:</b></i><p>
1. <i><b>In the Actions list, click Edit Page.</b></i><p>
<i><b>Note</b></i><i><b>If you see View Page in the Actions list, you are in edit mode.</b></i><p>

<h2>Hide a Web Part</h2><i><b>Sometimes you want to hide a Web Part so that it does not appear on the page, but you do not want to close it completely or delete it. For example, you may want to hide a Web Part that is providing data to another Web Part through a Web Part connection if only the second Web Part is actually of interest to people using a Web Part Page. Hide a Web Part by following these steps:</b></i><p>
1. <i><b>In the Actions list, click Edit Page.</b></i><p>
<i><b>Note</b></i><i><b>If you see View Page in the Actions list, you are in edit mode.</b></i><p>
