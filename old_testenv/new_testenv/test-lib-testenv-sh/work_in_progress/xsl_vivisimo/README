This is a series of tests designed to test the vivisimo xsl functions
(viv:whatever()).

Each test is is a standalone file labeled with the function name and
case number.  The tests are run using the ".tst" file for each directory.
This command will run all of the cases in a given directory.  The
output will be in a file called result.html in the test directory.  Each
test will exit with a pass/fail exit value and will state on exit what
the test result was.  In the case of a failure, please view the html
file to determine what the failure was.

The cases are set up so new tests can be added by doing a simple copy,
cut and paste.  Each case file is written using xml.  This xmal, along
with a global template and transformation xsl will create a new test xsl
file which is the test.  The test is run using "transform".  For a better
understanding, view one of the .tst files.  They are currently so short,
the tests are easily understood.
