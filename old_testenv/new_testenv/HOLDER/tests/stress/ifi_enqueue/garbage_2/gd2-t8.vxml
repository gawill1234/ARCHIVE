                <content name="type">This kid always got a bum deal.  Whenever he helped his friends, all they saw was he did it in a manner that was not perfect for that person, not that he found the way to help them all.  For example, he didn't take a sponsorship for their baseball team. Why? Because it would have meant that none of the girls could play (and neither could Snoopy). So he turned it down.  All the the team did, girls included, was berate him.</content>

                <content name="type">Lucy, the supposed fussbudget.  More like a complete bitch.  She is a teenage girl too early, believing she is absolutely the center of the universe and everything should be done to accommodate here needs.  Schroeder see's her for what she is and tells her to get lost.  Charlie Brown should as well, but he's actually too nice to do that.  Linux would like to, but he is her brother. Too bad for him.  I want her to be gagged.</content>

                <content name="type">The only kid who made some attempt to understand Charlie Brown's motives when he did stuff.  He was the only one who did not immediately condemn Charlie Brown for an apparently silly decision.  He went in to find out what something was done before going off, and having discovered the reasons for the action, almost never went off on him. I know some managers who could benefit from this method of doing things. Most are Lucy.</content>
