samba-16 is a basic samba crawl of an exported windows
samba/cifs share.

samba-2 is a basic samba crawl of an exported linux
samba/cifs share.

There are a couple of thousand documents
being crawled followed by a series of queries.  The queries
and the expected results are in the TEST_QUERIES file.

samba-16 and samba-2 should have identical results.
