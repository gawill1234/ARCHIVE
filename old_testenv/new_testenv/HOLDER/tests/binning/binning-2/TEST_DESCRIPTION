Basic crawl of an Oracle table/view.
Collection and source set up a mixed bag
using both binning and metadata.

binning-2, 2C and 2D vary only in the queries
added to the test.

Binning-2B first does the binning crawl and 
makes sure the unconfigured metadata does not
help the query.  The metadata is configured after
the crawl to assure the changes take effect.
