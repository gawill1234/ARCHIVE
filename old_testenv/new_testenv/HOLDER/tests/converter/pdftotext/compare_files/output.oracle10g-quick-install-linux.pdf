21

5.

If necessary, complete one of the following actions:
■

If the oracle user exists, but its primary group is not oinstall or it is not a member of the dba group, then enter the following command: # /usr/sbin/usermod -g oinstall -G dba oracle

■

If the oracle user does not exist, enter the following command to create it: # /usr/sbin/useradd -g oinstall -G dba oracle This command creates the oracle user and specifies oinstall as the primary group and dba as the secondary group.

6.

Enter the following command to set the password of the oracle user: # passwd oracle

7.

To determine whether the nobody user exists, enter the following command: # id nobody

22
