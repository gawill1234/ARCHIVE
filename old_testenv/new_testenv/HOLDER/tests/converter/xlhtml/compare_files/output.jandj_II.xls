A best reply here would refer to a specific case of concern to you.                                                                                                                                 You may be referring to the following case. Say, two top categories France (25 docs) and Paris (12 docs) share 9 documents  These 9 documents are likely to appear under France in a Paris subcluster, but NOT under Paris in a France subcluster. Why?  At each level, clustering uses the contextual information: under France, it is useful to know that a document is about Paris, but under Paris, 75% of the documents are about France and it is likely that the clustering will not consider France a worthy sub-cluster of Paris. So you may end up with &quot;France (25) &gt; Paris (9)&quot;, and &quot;Paris (12) &gt; Museum (3), Hotels (3), Tour (3), Texas (3)&quot; instead of &quot;Paris (12) &gt; France (9), Texas (3)&quot;. </FONT></TD>

<TD VALIGN="top">Meta-search does not accept simple boolean statements, often yielding in an error or no result. Sometimes the boolean statement is misinterpreted e,g. 'prostate cancer OR prostatic neoplasm' was translated to 'prostatic (neoplasm OR prostate)'. Often boolean 'AND' is interpreted as 'OR'. It is mandatory that at least ' AND' and 'OR' are interpreted correctly.</TD>
