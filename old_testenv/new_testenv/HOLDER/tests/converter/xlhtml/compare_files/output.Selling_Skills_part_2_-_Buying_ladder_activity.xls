<TD VALIGN="middle" BGCOLOR="FFFF99"><B>Dr Hatlock
Has always used POPs and considers himself very good at counselling women in the pros and cons of POPs.  Favours prescribing generically, favouring 30mcg LNG, and also Microgynon when using COCs.  He will admit to using desogestrel COCs and even Yasmin as a last resort in women who can’t tolerate other COCs.</B></TD>

<TD VALIGN="middle" BGCOLOR="FFFF99"><B>Dr Shaw
This doctor doesn’t see representatives in the surgery, but you got to speak at a recent meeting, where he joked at the name Cerazette – he didn’t appear to have heard of it.</B></TD>

<TR VALIGN="bottom">
<TD VALIGN="middle" BGCOLOR="FFFF99"><B>Dr Rapek
Has a number of women on POPs, though the vast majority of women coming to start on contraception end up on a COC, starting with Microgynon and then other options as they find a COC to settle on.  She has seen the Cerazette ads in the GP magazines and journals and has read an article on the 12-hour-rule and Cerazette</B></TD>

<TD VALIGN="middle" BGCOLOR="FFFF99"><B>Dr Jitman
Has seen the adverts in the medical press and recognises that Cerazette is a type of contraceptive pill.</B></TD>

<TR VALIGN="bottom">
<TD VALIGN="middle" BGCOLOR="FFFF99"><B>Dr Kamal
Sees reps regularly and spoke to someone in the Ashfield team about Cerazette and is excited about the implications of the 12-hour-rule.  She understands that bleeding patterns will be irregular, and even has a leave-piece in her drawer (she usually throws them away).  She has yet to find a suitable woman for Cerazette.</B></TD>
</TR>
<TR VALIGN="bottom">
<TD VALIGN="middle" BGCOLOR="FFFF99"><B>Dr Sonjack
Has read the Cerazette literature and patient information material that a representative left with him 2 months ago.  So far has 2 patients on Cerazette, one with oestrogen intolerance and dysmenorrhoea, and another, a 36-year-old smoker, who wanted to stop her COC (she had been taking Microgynon for 18 years), in no stable relationship.</B></TD>

<TD VALIGN="middle" BGCOLOR="FFFF99"><B>Dr Soveg
A family planning doctor who works 2 afternoons at the family planning clinic on York street, this doctor has studied the information on Cerazette he has been presented with by a representative, and is now prescribing Cerazette to those women under 35 who can’t take or who don’t want a COC.  For those women over 35 he prescribes LNG 30mcg.</B></TD>

<TD VALIGN="middle" BGCOLOR="FFFF99"><B>Dr Daveth
This doctor is interested in Cerazette and the literature and discussions with representatives.  She is regularly pressurised about prescribing budgets in the practice and has concerns over using Cerazette in place of all POPs.  She is using Cerazette as first port of call in women under 30 suffering from menstrual headaches who want an OC.</B></TD>

<TD VALIGN="middle" BGCOLOR="FFFF99"><B>Dr Roy
You’ve seen this doctor a few times about Cerazette now, and she is using it regularly.  When pressed as to which types of women you have discovered that, contrary to your assumptions about ‘all women wanting no oestrogens’, she is reserving it as a best choice for young breast feeding mothers wanting contraception.</B></TD>
</TR>
<TR VALIGN="bottom">
<TD VALIGN="middle" BGCOLOR="FFFF99"><B>Dr Carol
This doctor has had a keen interest in family Planning since medical school and works in an area with high teenage pregnancy and abortion rates.  She sees the Organon representative regularly for more patient information leaflets for Cerazette and the latest information, and was prescribing regularly before the 12-hour-rule was granted.  She now uses Cerazette for all women presenting looking effective oral contraception not tolerating or wanting to take oestrogens.</B></TD>

<TD VALIGN="middle" BGCOLOR="FFFF99"><B>Dr Ponty
Quite a polite, shy doctor who doesn’t usually see representatives, but surprised you being agreeing to see you 6 months ago.  The resulting discussing was heavily centred around Cerazette and there were lots of questions and a request for two clinical papers to be sent directly to the surgery.  You followed up recently with more data on BMD and breast milk, and confirmed what the pharmacist had implied.  This doctor is a keen advocate of Cerazette and although others in the practice are only dabbling still, he is using Cerazette with women wanting OCs where a COC is unwanted or inappropriate.

<TD VALIGN="middle" BGCOLOR="FFFF99"><B>Dr Blanc
This doctor has been involved in family planning since the 1970s and has been on the advisory board of several companies.  She has a keen interest in all developments in family planning, and had been waiting for Cerazette for many years!  She has been prescribing Cerazette since launch with excellent results.  The entire practice has been influenced by her, and all her colleagues are regular prescribers of Cerazette.  The local pharmacy hardly keeps any stock of traditional POPs any more.

<TD VALIGN="middle" BGCOLOR="FFFF99"><B>Dr Black
You were so pleased at your recent stand meeting when this doctor turned up to say hello when you were discussing Cerazette with a particularly industry-sceptical  and cost-conscious young GP.  He basically did your job for you and convinced the young GP that there really is little place for POPs now that Cerazette is here.
