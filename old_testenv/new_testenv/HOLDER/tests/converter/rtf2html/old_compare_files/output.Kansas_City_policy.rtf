</b></u><u><b><i>FAMILY AND JUVENILE DRUG COURT</i><p>
</b></u><b><p>
</b><b><i>SIXTEENTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT</i><p>
</b><b><i>JACKSON COUNTY, MISSOURI</i><p>
</b><p>
<b>I. </b><b><i>Introduction</i><p>
</b><b><p>
</b><i><b>The traditional adversarial system of justice has not been totally effective in addressing alcohol and other drugs of abuse.  Traditional prosecutorial and defense functions, coupled with standard court procedures, often reinforce the offender’s denial of a substance abuse problem.  In addition, the traditional dependency court system of case review occurs with less frequency.  The intensity and collaborative nature of the Family Drug Court Model is described as follows.</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>The Family Drug Court model transforms the roles of both the criminal justice/juvenile justice practitioners and the substance abuse treatment providers.  The judge is the central figure in the team effort focusing on sobriety, lawful behavior, and accountability as the primary goals.  As a result, the judge takes on a major role--keeping clients engaged in treatment.  Providers can then focus effectively on developing a therapeutic relationship with the client.  Finally, the treatment providers keep the court informed of each client’s progress so that incentives and sanctions can be provided.</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>The Family Drug Court creates an environment with clear and concise rules.  Each clients’ performance is immediately and directly communicated to the judge who, in turn, provides incentives for progress or applies sanctions for noncompliance.  The Family Drug Court establishes an environment the client understands; a system in which clear choices are presented and individuals are encouraged to take control of their own abstinence and recovery.</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>The Family Drug Court operates a coordinated, systemic approach to the substance abuser via comprehensive and inclusive planning; including an avenue for data collection and program evaluation.</b></i><p>
<b><p>
</b><b>II. </b><b><i>Mission and Goals </i><p>
</b><b><p>
</b><i><b>Mission:</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>To provide judicially managed community-based services, close supervision and specialized treatment to parents and juveniles whose substance abuse places their children or themselves at risk of substantially increased intervention by the justice system.</b></i><p>
<p>
<b><p>
</b><p>
<p>
<p>
<i><b>Goals:</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>To stop substance abuse by parents which threatens the safety and permanency of their dependent children.</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>To stop substance abuse by delinquent juveniles or that of their parents which places the juveniles at risk of further delinquent behavior.</b></i><p>
<p>
<b>III. </b><b><i>Eligible Cases</i><p>
</b><b><p>
</b><b>A. </b><b><i>Child Dependency and Child Endangerment/Criminal Cases</i><p>
</b><b><p>
</b><i><b>Cases assigned to the Family Drug Court may consist of:</b></i><p>
<p>
<b>1) </b><b><i>Child Dependency (Abuse/Neglect Civil Cases)</i><p>
</b><b><p>
</b><i><b>Any case filed pursuant to child abuse/neglect statutes wherein</b></i><p>
<i><b>parental substance is the primary or underlying cause for the neglect</b></i><p>
<i><b>or abuse of the child.</b></i><p>
<p>
<b>2) </b><b><i>Child Endangerment/Criminal Cases (Diversion)</i><p>
</b><b><p>
</b><i><b>Criminally-filed child endangerment cases in which the defendant/mother has had at least one drug-exposed child with a second or subsequent infant born with the mother or baby testing positive for any abused substance at the child’s birth, or;</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>A criminal defendant eligible for the Adult Drug Court who also has a child(ren) who is the subject of a dependency proceeding in the Family Court.</b></i><p>
<p>
<b>B. </b><b><i>Delinquency Cases</i><p>
</b><b><p>
</b><b>1) </b><b><i>Juvenile Delinquency Cases</i><p>
</b><p>
<i><b>Youth presently placed on probation whose continuing substance abuse causes behavior that will prevent compliance with any or all of the terms of the probation rules.</b></i><p>
<p>
<b>2) </b><b><i>Parental Substance Abuse</i><p>
</b><b><p>
</b><i><b>Delinquent cases in which parental substance abuse is a primary factor in the inability to return a juvenile to parental custody or to successfully maintain the juvenile on probation.</b></i><p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>IV. </b><b><i>Methodology</i><p>
</b><b><p>
</b><i><b>Family Drug Court Treatment Team</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>The Family Drug Court consists of two teams.  In common with both teams is a core group consisting of the Family Drug Court Commissioner, Family Drug Court Administrator, Attorney for the Juvenile Officer, Defense Attorney, Treatment Providers, Social Service Providers, family members and interested parties.</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>Specific to Abuse/Neglect and Child Endangerment cases:  </b></i><i><b>The team also includes the Adult Prosecutor, Guardian Ad Litem as well as the Division of Family Services Family Drug Court Case Manager.</b></i><p>
<i><b><p>
</b></i><i><b>Specific to Delinquency cases:</b></i><i><b>  The team also includes the Public Defender, Anti-Drug Deputy Juvenile Officer and the youth’s parent(s).</b></i><p>
<i><b><p>
</b></i><b>V. </b><b><i>Key Components:</i><p>
</b><b><p>
</b><b>A. </b><b><i>Integration of substance abuse treatment services with justice case processing.</i><p>
</b><b><p>
</b><i><b>The multi-phased treatment process includes a collaborative team-approach which involves the above-listed teams and may additionally include state and local level organizations representing substance abuse services, vocational rehabilitation, education, housing, and utility providers all having important roles to play.</b></i><p>
<p>
<b>B. </b><b><i>Use a non-adversarial approach.  Prosecution and defense counsel promote public safety while protecting clients’ due process rights.</i><p>
</b><p>
<i><b>The prosecutors and the defense attorneys participate in the screening, eligibility, and case processing to guarantee that due process rights and public safety needs are served.</b></i><p>
<p>
“<i><b>Prosecuting attorney”  </b></i><i><b>Attorney for the Juvenile Officer reviews the case and determines client’s initial eligibility for the program.  In addition, recommendations regarding the client’s performance in treatment rather than legal aspects of the case are made.  </b></i><p>
<i><b><p>
</b></i>“<i><b>Defense counsel”  </b></i><i><b>Reviews the charges, arrest warrant, affidavits, other relevant information, and reviews all program documents (e.g., waivers, written agreements etc.).  Advises the client as to the nature and purpose of the Family Drug Court, the rules, incentives and sanctions governing participation, and further informs the client that s/he is expected to speak directly to the judiciary, not through their attorney.</b></i><p>
<i><b><p>
</b></i><p>
<b>C. </b><b><i>Eligible clients are identified early and promptly placed in the family drug court.</i><p>
</b><b><p>
</b><i><b>The period immediately after charges are filed provides a critical window of opportunity for intervention by introducing the value of substance abuse treatment.  Judicial action promptly after filing capitalizes on the crisis nature of having charges filed.  It is critical that the referral to the Family Drug Court be immediately followed by a court appearance in order for the intervention to become effective.</b></i><p>
<p>
? <i><b>Eligibility screening is based on established written criteria.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Eligible clients for drug court are promptly advised about the drug court program requirements and the relative merits of participating.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Trained professionals screen drug court eligible individuals for substance abuse problems and appropriateness for treatment.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Initial appearance before the drug court judiciary occurs immediately after referral to ensure program participation.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Eligible clients are immediately enrolled in substance abuse treatment services.</b></i><p>
<p>
<b>D. </b><b><i>Provides access to a continuum of substance abuse and other related treatment and rehabilitation services.</i><p>
</b><b><p>
</b>? <i><b>Substance abuse problems are complex and unique to each individual and influenced by a variety of accumulated bio-psycho-socio-cultural experiences.  This model uses a holistic approach to the client and family treatment plan strategies, which incorporate medical and mental health, housing, vocational, family, and legal issues.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Clients are initially screened and re-assessed by both the Family Drug Court and treatment providers.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Treatment services are comprehensive and provide:  Individual and Group Counseling, Relapse Prevention, Self-Help Groups, Preventive and Primary Medical Care, General Health and Nutrition Education, Parenting Skills, Domestic Violence Education including Treatment for Batterers and treatment for long-term effects of childhood physical and sexual abuse.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Case Management services are provided so an uninterrupted continuum of care and monitoring of client progress occurs.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Treatment services are accessible.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Funding for treatment services is adequate, stable, and dedicated to the Family Drug Court clients.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Treatment services have quality controls.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Treatment service providers are accountable.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Treatment designs and delivery systems are sensitive and relevant to issues of race, culture, religion, gender, age, ethnicity and sexual orientation.</b></i><p>
<p>
<p>
<b>E. </b><b><i>Frequent urinalysis testing monitors abstinence.</i><p>
</b><b><p>
</b><i><b>Urinalysis testing is essential in monitoring client compliance.  It is an accurate, cost-effective, objective and efficient way to establish a framework for accountability and to gauge each client’s progress.</b></i><p>
<p>
<b><p>
</b><b>F. </b><b><i>A coordinated strategy governs Family Drug Court responses to clients’</i><p>
</b><b><i>compliance.</i><p>
</b><p>
? <i><b>Abstinence from substance abuse and related criminal activity are the ultimate goals of the Family Drug Court.</b></i><p>
<p>
? <i><b>Continuing substance abuse is not condoned, although it is recognized that relapse is a part of the recovery process.  Sanctions are imposed for continued substance abuse and increase in severity for continued non-compliance.</b></i><p>
<p>
? <i><b>Incentives for cooperation and abstinence are equally important and are structured into the system of responses.  Graduation ceremonies will also take place upon completion of the program.</b></i><p>
<p>
<b>G. </b><b><i>Ongoing judicial interaction with each client is essential.</i><p>
</b><b><p>
</b><i><b>The judiciary is the leader of the Family Drug Court team, linking clients to substance abuse treatment and to the justice system.</b></i><p>
<p>
? <i><b>Regular status hearings are used to monitor client performance.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Appropriate incentives and sanctions are applied to match the clients’ treatment progress.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Payment of fees, fines and/or restitution, may be part of the clients’ treatment.</b></i><p>
<p>
<b>H. </b><b><i>Monitor and evaluate the achievement of program goals and gauge effectiveness.</i><p>
</b><b><p>
</b><i><b>Data collection is automated and designed to monitor daily activities, evaluate the quality of services provided and produce outcome evaluations.</b></i><p>
<p>
<b>I. </b><b><i>Continuing interdisciplinary education promotes effective family drug court planning, implementation and operations.</i><p>
</b><b><p>
</b><i><b>The Family Drug Court provides and makes accessible education and training to ensure the drug courts’ goals and objectives are understood by the drug court team, and by those indirectly involved in the program.</b></i><p>
<p>
<b><p>
</b><b>J. </b><b><i>Collaboration among the Family Drug Court, public agencies, and community-based organizations generate local support and enhances Family Drug Court effectiveness.</i><p>
</b><b><p>
</b><i><b>The Family Drug Court, as part of the justice system, has developed collaborations among private and public community-based organizations, public criminal justice agencies, law enforcement, and substance abuse treatment delivery systems.  Forming such collaborations has expanded the continuum of services available to Family Drug Court clients and informed the community about the Family Drug Court concepts.</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>The Family Drug Court model has been developed and implemented by team effort, and under the direction of the Juvenile Officer/Family Court Administrator of the 16th Judicial Circuit in Missouri.

<b><p>
</b><p>
<u><i><b>Screening and Eligibility<p>
</b></i></u><b><p>
</b><p>
<i><b>Screening Process</b></i><i><b>—The process of cases will begin at three possible points of intervention.</b></i><p>
<p>
1) <i><b>Newborn Crisis Assessments</b></i><i><b>—A medical social worker, nurse or physician activates a Newborn Crisis Assessment (NCA) request by calling the State of Missouri Child Abuse Hotline when an infant tests positive for an illicit drug at delivery, a mother tests positive for an illicit drug at delivery or a physician has reason to believe there are serious risk concerns for the infant due to illicit drug use by a parent.  This assessment request is treated in an emergent manner and response is timely.  The average assessment is completed within 24 – 36 hours after delivery of the infant. The Newborn Crisis (NC) team consists of two  Division of Family Services workers.  The infant is not released from the hospital until the written assessment has been reviewed as described below.  The assessment tool is a local document.  The assessment tool addresses the following:  family composition, prenatal care, paternity, pregnancy complications, physical, emotional and intellectual functioning of the parent(s), attachment and bonding, parenting skills and sibling assessment, prior history of abuse and neglect, planning/preparation for the infant’s birth/hospital discharge, behavior associated with drug and alcohol use, criminal history (e.g., a criminal background check is run on all adults residing in the home over the age of 18), mother and infant’s toxicology at birth, infant’s withdrawal signs or medical complications, special health care needs of the infant, family supports, condition of the home, history of domestic violence, other concerns/strengths, safety plan and a recommendation for disposition/placement.  The assessor often has facilitated an assessment appointment for the potential client at a treatment facility prior to discharge from the hospital.  </b></i><p>
<b><p>
</b><i><b>The completed assessment is faxed to the Child Protection Attorney (CPA) at Family Court for review regarding statutory requirements.   The eligibility screening consists of three steps: presumptive qualifying characteristics, clinical guidelines and disqualifying characteristics. The CPA gives the information to the Drug Court Administrator of the Family and Juvenile Drug Court (FJDC) for clinical review if the family is eligible for consideration. The review by the CPA averages four to six hours.  The review by the Drug Court Administrator (DCA) averages one to three hours.  If this review is in agreement (and if there is available space), the case is put on the docket for the initial detention hearing.  A petition (and temporary custody disposition) is completed and filed.  The hearing is scheduled to occur within seven to ten days.  A case manager and attorney are assigned.  Other procedures (e.g., 72-hour meeting for children placed in protective custody outside the home) are scheduled and appropriate parties are notified.  </b></i><p>
<p>
2) <i><b>Other Child Dependency Cases</b></i><i><b>—If a Hotline call alleges parental substance abuse or neglect due to parental substance abuse, and the family requires Court intervention, the Division of Family Services (DFS) will forward a Protective Custody Assessment to the CPA.  The case must meet the requirements of Section 211.031.1 RSMo. The procedures for reviewing assessments as outlined above will be activated.</b></i><p>
<p>
3) <i><b>Criminal Cases</b></i><i><b>—Child endangerment charges will be filed in cases of a second or more drug exposed infants. When a NCA is completed on a mother with a second or more drug exposed infant, the case will be referred to the Sex Crimes Unit of the Kansas City, Missouri, Police Department or to the corresponding unit of the agency in the municipality where the child was born.  A detective will be assigned to the case and will conduct an investigation. The detective will refer the case to the Sex Crimes Unit of the Jackson County Prosecutor’s Office.  This unit will transfer the case to the Administrator of the Diversion Programs/Assistant Prosecutor who will review the case and file charges if the mother has qualified and has been accepted into the FJDC.  The attorney for the Juvenile Officer assigned to the FJDC will send photocopies of the initial FJDC eligibility screening form to the Administrator of the Diversion Programs/Assistant prosecutor.  </b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>If the mother is not eligible for the FJDC, the Administrator of the Diversion Programs/Assistant Prosecutor will refer the case back to the Sex Crimes Unit of the Jackson County Prosecutor’s Office for review and possible filing of criminal charges.</b></i><p>
<b><p>
</b><i><b>Procedures for cases transferred to the Family Court Division</b></i><i><b>:</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>Filing:</b></i><i><b>  The prosecutor’s office will hand carry all complaints to Criminal Records for filing.  A designated worker in Criminal Records will handle all of the complaints.  The prosecutor’s office will send a file-stamped courtesy copy to:</b></i><p>

<p>
<i><b>If the defendant posts bond on the warrant, the county jail officials will give the defendant a court date to appear before Division 44 in three working days at 9:00 AM.</b></i><p>
<p>

<p>
<i><b>Preliminary Hearing/Arraignment into Circuit Court:  </b></i><i><b>The Commissioner of the FJDC will handle the waiver of preliminary hearing.  The attorney for the Juvenile Officer will appear on behalf of the Jackson County Prosecuting Attorney for the waiver of the preliminary hearing and formal arraignment into circuit court.  The Director of Legal Services and his or her designees will be appointed as special prosecutor for the limited purposes of these hearings.

<b><p>
</b><i><b>The Administrative Judge of the Family Court will handle the formal arraignment into circuit court.  The Judge will give the defendant the next court date before Division 44 and will enter an arraignment and pre-trial order.

Currently there are four defense attorneys who provide pro bono legal services for FJDC clients.  If a participant should choose to hire private counsel, the attorney shall enter a record of appearance and follow the established protocol of the FJDC team when reviews are held.</b></i><p>
<p>
<b><i>TREATMENT</i><p>
</b><p>
<i><b> Referral to an accredited treatment facility will be actively pursued prior to the detention hearing.  The participant will sign a release of information for the FJDC team to receive and exchange information relating to the initial assessment and any contact thereafter, including urinalysis reports.  The participant will attend any and all assessments, in or out patient programs, and any outside meetings as ordered. The FJDC will consider the participant’s level of cooperation, history of usage and geographic location of residence if a request for a change in treatment location is raised.  The primary treatment resource of the FJDC is North Star Research Recovery, Inc.  This or any other treatment facility will develop a substance abuse treatment plan, subject to the acceptance of it by the FJDC team.  The treatment facility will keep the FJDC informed of the participant’s progress or lack thereof, which will include attendance, level of cooperation, results of urinalysis and any concerns regarding parenting or the welfare of any children in the custody of participant.  The primary treatment center will provide a designated worker who routinely participates in the FJDC staffings.  This worker or the agency’s staff will be familiar with the participants’ progress in treatment and also will notify the Program Manager and/or the case manager(s) of any significant issues outside of the regularly scheduled Court hearings.  </b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b> The participants may be participating in various levels of treatment if the facilitity is a Comprehensive Substance Abuse Treatment and Rehabilitation  (CSTAR) program.  The provision of childcare and therapeutic interventions/activities for children, in addition to treatment for the mother, is part of the services provided. The levels of treatment below identify the suggested choices based on the provider assessment and/or the recommendation of the FJDC team. </b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b><u>Level I Residential Treatment</u></b></i><i><b>.  Client needs continuous structure, supervision and treatment to achieve and maintain sobriety or access to outpatient primary treatment on a nonresidential basis is not available due to distance and lack of transportation.  Client meets all criteria for Level I Outpatient Primary Treatment admission and the following conditions:</b></i><p>
<p>
? <i><b>A current living environment which places the client in imminent danger and precludes the client’s ability to participate in and benefit from Primary Outpatient Treatment.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>An immediate need for twenty-four (24) hour supervision, structure, and support related to the client’s current emotional and behavioral status.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>A current demonstrated inability to significantly reduce and alter substance use patterns despite regular participation in nonresidential primary treatment.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Access to Primary Treatment on a nonresidential basis is not available due to distance and/or a lack of transportation.</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b><u>Level I Outpatient Primary Treatment</u></b></i><i><b>—Client needs daily or almost daily structure, supervision, and treatment to achieve and maintain sobriety.  Specifically, admission shall be based on:</b></i><p>
<p>
? <i><b>Evidence client cannot control chemical use without close monitoring and structured support.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Need for daily or almost daily treatment services.</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b><u>Level II Outpatient/Rehabilitation Treatment</u></b></i><i><b>—Client is not in crisis but needs active participation in rehabilitation program to initiate or sustain recovery.  Specifically, admission shall be based on:</b></i><p>
<p>
? <i><b>Ability to limit substance use and remain abstinent without close monitoring and structured support.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Absence of a crisis that cannot be resolved by community support services.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Evidence of willingness to participate in the program, keep appointments, participate in self-help, and</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Willingness, as clinically appropriate, to involve significant others in the treatment program, such as family, employer, parole officer, etc.</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b><u>Level III Outpatient/Supported Recovery Services</u></b></i><i><b>—Client has support system for recovery or has completed Level I or Level II treatment.  Specifically, admission shall be used on:</b></i><p>
<p>
? <i><b>Abuse diagnosis or dependence diagnosis in remission.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Evidence of a desire to participate fully in the treatment regimen and maintain a drug-free lifestyle.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Adequacy of resources to support self in the community.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Absence of a crisis that cannot be resolved by community support services.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Lack of a need for intensive or structured treatment.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Involvement in the community, such as family, church, employer, and</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Presence of an appropriate substance-free support structure in the community.</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b><u>Clinical review process</u></b></i><i><b>--CSTAR clients who do not meet initial admission criteria for a particular level of care but wish to participate in a particular level due to individual circumstances shall be reviewed by the program manager and if approved, their request sent to clinical review for final approval.</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b> An aftercare plan is an integral part of the treatment process.  The decision to release the client from FJDC is based on the establishment of aftercare and indicators the client is in compliance.  </b></i><p>
<p>
<p>
<b><i>URINALYSIS</i><p>
</b><p>
<i><b> The FJDC will follow the established protocols of the Family Court regarding urinalysis. Physician’s Reference Laboratory primarily will conduct analysis on collected urine specimens.</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>Participants tested will be judicially ordered to submit urine specimens at various times throughout the process.  These are ordered randomly.  Frequency is directly correlated to consistent treatment attendance, noted changes in affect and physical appearance, and level of cooperation.  The usual schedule is a baseline specimen upon entry into the program.  Thereafter, each case is individually assessed to determine the need for analysis, following the guidelines of a level system, which is addressed in another section.  For example, if a marijuana user has tested negative for four consecutive analysis and is cooperating with the case plan (e.g., attending treatment, coming to court reviews etc.), testing would occur at least monthly.  Conversely, if a participant inconsistently attends treatment, misses court reviews and or avoids contact with case manager, testing will be increased.</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>Positive analysis will result in a revised treatment plan which may include residential treatment, intensive out-patient, 90 meetings in 90 days, or other actions deemed appropriate by the Judiciary or a consensus of the team.</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>Processing and collection of the analysis must follow procedures, which establish a proper “Chain of Custody.”  Chain of Custody is defined as the “one who offers evidence in Court must be able to account for the custody of the specimen from the moment it is obtained to the time it is presented as evidence in Court.”</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>Judicial order must be in effect.  Collection is done in private on site, at home, school or employment by a same gender CM/ACW or other Court personnel.  Direct observation will be utilized.  The “Corrections Drug Testing Custody and Control Form” (see Appendix), U.A. specimen kit, latex gloves and bluing solution (if needed) will be placed in an opaque bag.  It is recommended the form be partially filled out prior to the collection in order to avoid mistakes.  The following procedures are to be followed precisely:</b></i><p>
<b><p>
</b><i><b>Positive identification of the participant.</b></i><p>
<i><b>Correct completion of the Corrections etc. form:</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>Section I. AGENCY:  Already completed.</b></i><p>
<i><b>Section II. TEST:  Check DP9AE+(TCAOPBZMXE) Bundled</b></i><p>
<i><b>Section III. DONOR INFORMATION:  add LIFE #, check DOES NOT APPLY, indicate Date.</b></i><p>
<i><b>Section IV. COLLECTION INFORMATION: complete WAS COLLECTION OBSERVED?, indicate all Medications (prescription or over the counter) at MISC. COLLECTOR COMMENT, complete COLLECTION LOCATION.</b></i><p>
<i><b>Section V. COLLECTOR’S CERTIFICATION STATEMENT AND CHAIN OF CUSTODY:  Sign and print collector’s name and date.</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>BOTTLE CUSTODY SEAL</b></i><i><b>:  Indicate DONOR LIFE#, DATE, DONOR’S INITIALS.  </b></i><p>
<b><p>
</b>? <i><b>Participant must remove any outer garments (e.g., coats, and jackets) and place purses, diaper bags, or other items directly outside the toilet area.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Pockets must be emptied and at the discretion of the collector, a pat search may be initiated.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Pant legs or skirts may be lifted to verify there are no hidden containers of adulterated urine at the discretion of the collector.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Thorough hand washing and drying of the hands by the participant before the specimen is collected.  Observe and examine the process.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Participant is given the pre-wrapped specimen kit to observe for tampering.  If the kit is observed to be without flaws, the participant opens the outer package for further observation.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Mandatory</b></i><i><b>:  Collector puts on latex gloves.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>If the bluing agent is used, put it in the toilet and instruct the participant not to flush until the specimen has been collected.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>The participant is instructed to urinate into the specimen cup until the urine reaches the 30 ML line.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>The collector observes the temperature of the urine via the temperature strip on the cup as well as the collection amount (e.g., at least 30 ML).  </b></i><p>
? <i><b>The participant pours the urine from the cup to the bottle, affixing the cap tightly.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>The participant carefully attaches the Security Seal tape by centering it over the specimen bottle cap.  </b></i><p>
? <i><b>The participant places the bottle inside the bag.  The security tape on this bag will be removed and sealed by the participant.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Place the first copy of the “Corrections Drug Testing Custody and Control Form” in the front outer pouch of the specimen bag.  Give a copy of the form to the participant and the third form is placed in the case manager’s file.  Store the specimen in the designated refrigerator unless there is immediate courier pick-up.  </b></i><p>
? <i><b>Collector records all pertinent information on the “Urinalysis Log.”</b></i><p>
? <i><b>No unauthorized person shall handle the specimen at any time.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>STAT pick-up is encouraged when there is suspicion a participant is in an altered state.  This process enables you to receive results of a positive or negative within four hours from the PRL after pick-up of the specimen.  Procedure for this requests is as follows:  1) affix a STAT sticker to the outside of the Urine Specimen bag; 2) call PRL’s Patient Care Services (338-4090), speak to the dispatcher and explain you have a STAT pick-up.  Provide your location name, your name, address and telephone number where you will be.  The STAT pick-up cannot be used if you are unable to be reached by phone during the process.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>A participant who fails to provide a urine specimen within 45 minutes will have a “stall” recorded on the specimen paperwork.  All “stalls” are interpreted as deliberately withholding a urine specimen in order to avoid a positive test result. </b></i><p>
<b><p>
</b><i><b>Positive results notification will occur within 24 hours after the results are received.  The CM/ACW will notify the participant by telephone directly, before a court review or by letter to the last known address.  Positive results will also be conveyed to the treatment site.</b></i><p>
<p>
<b><i>In-House Testing</i><p>
</b><p>
<i><b>Collector will assemble the following items:</b></i><p>
<p>
? <i><b>Test stick for desired substance</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Specimen cup</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Latex gloves</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Urinalysis log sheet</b></i><p>
<p>
? <i><b>Instruct the client to remove outer garments and set aside along with any other personal items             such as backpacks, purses, diaper bags or packages.</b></i><p>
<p>
? <i><b>Instruct the client to use soap to wash, rinse and thoroughly dry hands.</b></i><p>
<p>
? <i><b>Examine the client’s hands and arms for possible adulteration substances.</b></i><p>
<p>
? <i><b>Put on latex gloves.</b></i><p>
<p>
? <i><b>Remove the large cup from the sealed package and hand it to the client, instructing the client to fill the cup to the 30ML line.  This is necessary in the event confirmation is required.</b></i><p>
<p>
? <i><b>The UA Specialist or other Court personnel must observe the stream of urine entering the specimen cup.  Under no circumstances should the client be left alone during the collection process.</b></i><p>
<p>
? <i><b>Remove TesTstik from foil pouch.</b></i><p>
<p>
? <i><b>Fully retract the protective sample pad cover by sliding it towards the opposite end of the TesTstik until it can go no farther.</b></i><p>
<p>
? <i><b>Gently immerse the exposed sample pad into the specimen until the specimen reaches the “Dip Line.”  DO NOT immerse the entire device into the specimen.  If there is insufficient sample to reach the required “Dip Line,” tip the specimen container until the specimen reaches the “Dip Line.”  Keep the TesTstik in the specimen for a full count of 5-10 seconds.</b></i><p>
<p>
? <i><b>Remove the TesTstik from the specimen and while holding the TesTstik over the specimen, slide the sample pad cover until it stops.</b></i><p>
<p>
? <i><b>Allow the test to proceed until a distinct blue band is observed in the “TEST VALID” window.  The TesTstik may be placed on a level surface or held while the band is developing.  There is no required timing step.  </b></i><p>
<p>
? <i><b>Once the “TEST VALID” line appears, break off and remove the tab from the sample pad cover which covers the result window.</b></i><p>
<p>
? <i><b>Read and record the results on the Urinalysis Log.  Appearance of any blue band (dark, light or partial) in the result window depicts a negative result.  A white plus (+) sign (absence of any color in the test window) depicts a positive result.</b></i><p>
<p>
? <i><b>When the TesTstik results are positive, the results need to be confirmed.  Follow the procedures as outlined in the previous section regarding processing of samples through the Physician’s Reference Laboratory.  </b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>The UA Specialist or the Anti Drug DJO who is performing the test will maintain the urinalysis log.  The  results of the TesTstik will be entered in the computer database within two days of the test.  </b></i><p>
<p>
<b><i>SCHEDULE OF TESTING</i><p>
</b><p>
<i><b> Randomness is key.  Testing must not be predictable to the client.  The  UA Specialist for the Family Drug Court will be the primary staff person testing all female clients. CM/ACW will test clients if it is necessary and appropriate for the situation.  Anti Drug DJOs will test their clients in Juvenile Drug Court.</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>Baseline test for all clients.</b></i><p>
<i><b>In patient clients—On suspicion or after weekend passes</b></i><p>
<i><b>Out patient clients—Utilize level system as follows:</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>Level I treatment</b></i><i><b> (daily treatment or 3-4 times per week):  1-2 times per week depending on drug of choice, cooperation, participation in treatment (except for marijuana only use, then test every two – three weeks).</b></i><p>
<i><b>Level II treatment</b></i><i><b> (2-3 days of treatment per week):  1 time per week depending on drug of choice, cooperation, participation in treatment (except for marijuana only use, then test every two – three weeks).</b></i><p>
<i><b>Level III treatment</b></i><i><b> (1 day of treatment per week): 1 time every other week or 1 time per month depending on drug of choice, cooperation, and participation in treatment.</b></i><p>
<i><b>Level IV treatment</b></i><i><b> (treatment completed, participating in community after care):  Phase 4 UA:  Upon suspicion and 1 time every four to six weeks.</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>Other issues to consider:</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>Admission by the client.  Document and do not test unless drug of choice has changed  (e.g., formerly cocaine and now marijuana).</b></i><p>
<i><b>Submit every third UA for appropriate processing in order to maintain the true randomness of the process.</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>The randomized telephone system of UA collection consists of the following protocol:</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>Each client is assigned a number.  Sunday through Thursday the UA Specialist randomly selects numbers that are recorded on her telephone shortly before 5:00 PM on those days.  The client telephones, listens to the recording and then must appear at Court the next day during the times specified if his/her number is selected.  Special arrangements can be made for unusual circumstances or for clients who are employed.  Failure to appear without a valid excuse from a physician or employer is noted as a positive</b></i><p>
<p>
<b><i>STATUS REVIEWS/STAFFINGS</i><p>
</b><p>
<i><b>The FJDC team (Commissioner, CM/ACW, GAL, defense  attorney, treatment representative, DFS worker, community or program representative) will meet prior to the review for the purpose of reviewing the participant’s progress in treatment and other services, results of urinalysis, level of cooperation and the welfare of the child(ren). Team members will have an opportunity to present information regarding the participant.  The team will then develop a recommendation.</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>Frequency of hearings: (This is tied directly to the level of treatment)</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>1st Phase: Weekly hearings for four weeks.  Thereafter, twice monthly if progressing in treatment.</b></i><p>
<i><b>2nd Phase: Twice monthly hearings for 12 weeks to 24 weeks.</b></i><p>
<i><b>3rd Phase: Monthly hearing 12 weeks to 24 weeks.</b></i><p>
<i><b>4th Phase: Hearing every 4 to 6 weeks for 24 weeks. </b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b> If new information is presented by the client during the review process, any team member may request a brief recess to reassess implementing a new recommendation or utilizing the recommendation the team had formulated during the staffing.  The purpose of the recess is to insure the team has weighed the new information against the information obtained in the staffing.  Changing the team recommendation should be carefully reviewed in order to maintain the team concept.  However, the Commissioner is the final decision-maker.</b></i><p>
<p>
<b><i>SANCTIONS</i><p>
</b><p>
<i><b> </b></i><i><b>Violations of the Court’s order, which would include positive urinalysis, failure to attend treatment, no-show at Court hearings, failure to cooperate with home visits by the case manager, missed visits with children unless excuse is honored by the team, or other specific violations will result in a graduated system of sanctions.   </b></i><p>
<p>
? <i><b>First noncompliance: Reprimand from the bench on most violations.  Positive urinalysis will result in an extra day of treatment for an out patient participant.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Second violation: Participant will increase treatment activity, watch specific educational videos and write one to two page report, write letter to children if parent missed a visit (first reviewed by a therapist), write essays, create art to express emotions, complete community service, sit in Court all day, etc.  Return to previous phase of Court hearings.</b></i><p>
? <i><b>Third violation: As above.  Also, home detention/electronic monitoring, brief incarceration.  Return to previous phase of Court hearings.</b></i><p>
<p>
<b><i>REWARDS</i><p>
</b><p>
<i><b> </b></i><i><b>Recognition and/or a tangible reward will be offered to clients who are in compliance with the Court order and following the treatment plan.  Examples are as follows: verbal recognition from the bench, increased visitation with children, decreased court attendance, certificates for sobriety (e.g., 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, 120 days etc.), grocery or clothing vouchers, tickets or passes to community activities or family related events.</b></i><p>
<p>
<b><i>TRANSFERRING CASES FROM OTHER DOCKETS  </i><p>
</b><p>
<i><b> </b></i><i><b>Cases in other courtrooms may be considered for transfer.  A Commissioner or Judge may request consideration by contacting the Prosecutor assigned to the FJDC.  The Prosecutor will review the case file.  If the case meets the established criteria, the Drug Court Administrator will then determine the clinical eligibility. If there is available space on CM/ACW caseload, the case will be transferred to the FJDC docket.  A motion for transfer will be prepared and filed.  The Commissioner or Judge requesting the transfer will prepare the Order.  Notice of the transfer will be sent to all appropriate parties and the matter will be set for an initial review in FJDC. </b></i><p>
<p>
<p>
<b><i>TRANSFERRING CASES TO OTHER DOCKETS</i><p>
</b><p>
<i><b> </b></i><i><b>Cases may be transferred to other dockets when the participant is unsuccessful in his/her participation.  This could include: no progress over a six month period, a period of 60 days with no meaningful participation with treatment, case manager or FJDC, new charges filed which are not drug related, establishment of abandonment criteria or permanency planning has been initiated.  The procedures are as follows:</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>Recommendation is made by the team.  The Attorney for the Juvenile Officer drafts a motion.  Within that motion specific statements and dates of lack of cooperation and progress, services recommended and offered etc.  Evidentiary hearing is held.  Order is entered granting the transfer.</b></i><p>
<p>
<p>
<b><i>GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS</i><p>
</b><p>
<i><b> The FJDC team reviews cases considered for graduation based on the established phase criteria (see phase description in the appendix).  If the client has achieved the status of phase four and completed tasks to the satisfaction of the team, the client would then be eligible for graduation at one of four times during the year.   The following criteria is standard for the successful participant:</b></i><p>

</b><i><b>The ADJO will make a home visit at least once monthly during the length of participation.  The ADJO will make contact in person with the juvenile on a weekly basis during the first 12 weeks of entry into the FDJC.  Contact is decreased as the juvenile completes treatment, tests negative during the 12 week phase, attends Court hearings, and complies with other aspects of the Court order (e.g., attends school, secures employment, etc.)  If non-compliance occurs, contact will be increased until compliance is achieved.</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>Treatment—</b></i><i><b>The juvenile will participate in a recommended course of substance abuse treatment.  Currently Scott Greening Center is the primary treatment resource for juvenile in or out patient treatment.  A representative from Scott Greening will be present at staffings to report on the progress of the juvenile.  When other treatment providers are involved, that treatment provider will follow the protocol as established with Scott Greening.  ADJO will monitor progress regarding treatment.  Parents will be asked to participate in treatment if appropriate, as well as submit to urinalyses.  Other resources will be offered to families as recommended or requested.  All cases requiring long term placement (e.g., exceeds 30 days) out of home care  must be staffed by the Placement Review Committee.</b></i><p>

</b></u><u><b><i>Family Drug Court</i><p>
</b></u><b><i>Program Rules</i><p>
</b><b><p>
</b><b><i> As a Family Drug Court participant, you will be required to abide by the following rules:</i><p>
</b><b><p>
</b><i><b>Do not use or possess any drugs or alcohol</b></i><b><i>.  </i></b><i><b>Sobriety is the primary focus of this program.  Maintaining a drug free lifestyle is very important in your recovery process.  Carefully choose the people with whom you associate.</b></i><p>
<b><p>
</b><i><b>Attend all ordered treatment sessions.  </b></i><i><b>This includes individual and group counseling, educational sessions and 12-step meetings.  If you are unable to attend a scheduled session, you MUST contact your treatment counselor BEFORE a session is missed.</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>Report to your Case Manager as directed. </b></i><i><b>If you have any problems making an appointment, contact your case manager immediately.  This is especially important for requested urinalysis.</b></i><p>
<b><p>
</b><i><b>Be on time.  </b></i><i><b>If you are late, you may not be allowed to attend your counseling session and will be considered non-compliant.  Contact your treatment counselor if there is a possibility you may be late.</b></i><p>
<b><p>
</b><i><b>Do not make threats toward other participants or staff or behave in a violent manner.  </b></i><i><b>Violent or inappropriate behavior will not be tolerated and will be reported to Court.  This may result in termination from the Family Drug Court Program.</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>Dress appropriately for Court and treatment sessions.  </b></i><i><b>You will be expected to wear a shirt or blouse, pants, dress, or skirt of a reasonable length.  Clothing bearing drug or alcohol related themes or promoting or advertising alcohol or drug use or violence is considered inappropriate.  Men should remove hats or other head/hair covering before entering the Court.  Sunglasses are not to be worn inside Court or treatment center unless medically approved and verified.  Speak with your case manager or treatment contacts if you need assistance with clothing.</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>Always tell the truth.  </b></i><i><b>This value will be upheld.  Withholding information is the same as a lie.  Rebuilding credibility takes a long time after losing it.  Please know almost 100% of the lies, which are told, are discovered.</b></i><p>
<i><b><p>
</b></i><i><b>When in doubt about a rule, consult with your attorney and/or case manager before making a mistake, which has serious consequences.<p>

<i><b>Dear ________________:</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b> You and your family will be participating in the Juvenile Drug Court Program.  This packet will hopefully answer many of your questions and help you make the right decisions as you begin your recovery from alcohol or illicit drugs.  This packet contains the Juvenile Drug Court rules, a contract you will sign in the presence of your assigned attorney, resources, graduation requirements and a record of your urinalysis.   Your Court orders and other official documents should also be kept in this folder for easy reference.  You will need to bring this packet to Court with you at each appearance.  Keep it in a safe place.</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b> Most participants have various questions about this Program.  Your assigned Deputy Juvenile Officer and attorney should be able to answer most of your questions.  Your success will be directly related to the choices you make.  Change can occur if you are willing to take responsibility for your actions.  </b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b> This Program is an opportunity for you and your family to have a chance living a drug-free life.  Good luck, and please contact me if you have additional questions.</b></i><p>

</b></u><b><i>Program Rules</i><p>
</b><b><p>
</b><b><i> As a Juvenile Drug Court participant, you will be required to abide by the following rules:</i><p>
</b><b><p>
</b><i><b>Do not use or possess any drugs or alcohol</b></i><b><i>.  </i></b><i><b>Sobriety is the primary focus of this program.  Maintaining a drug free lifestyle is very important in your recovery process.  Carefully choose the people with whom you associate.</b></i><p>
<b><p>
</b><i><b>Attend all ordered treatment sessions.  </b></i><i><b>This includes individual and group counseling, educational sessions and 12-step meetings.  If you are unable to attend a scheduled session, you MUST contact your treatment counselor BEFORE a session is missed.</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>Report to your DJO as directed. </b></i><i><b>If you have any problems making an appointment, contact your DJO immediately.  This is especially important for requested urinalysis.</b></i><p>
<b><p>
</b><i><b>Be on time.  </b></i><i><b>If you are late, you may not be allowed to attend your counseling session and will be considered non-compliant.  Contact your treatment counselor if there is a possibility you may be late.</b></i><p>
<b><p>
</b><i><b>Do not make threats toward other participants or staff or behavior in a violent manner.  </b></i><i><b>Violent or inappropriate behavior will not be tolerated and will be reported to Court.  This may result in termination from the Juvenile Drug Court Program.</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>Dress appropriately for Court and treatment sessions.  </b></i><i><b>You will be expected to wear a shirt or blouse, pants (no “sagging or bagging”), dress, or skirt of a reasonable length.  Clothing bearing drug or alcohol related themes or promoting or advertising alcohol or drug use or violence is considered inappropriate. Males should remove hats or other head/hair covering before entering the Court.  Sunglasses are not to be worn inside Court or treatment center unless medically approved and verified.  Speak with your DJO or treatment contacts if you need assistance with clothing.</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>Always tell the truth.  </b></i><i><b>This value will be upheld.  Withholding information is the same as a lie.  Rebuilding credibility takes a long time after losing it.  Please know almost 100% of the lies, which are told, are discovered.</b></i><p>
<p>
<i><b>When in doubt about a rule, consult with your attorney and/or DJO before making a mistake, which has serious consequences.<p>
