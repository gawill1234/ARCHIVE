<DIV style="position:absolute;top:114;left:303"><nobr><span class="ft0">Declaration of Independence</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:167;left:325"><nobr><span class="ft1">IN CONGRESS, July 4, 1776.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:213;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft3"><b>The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America,</b></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:255;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft4">When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the<br>political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the<br>earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle<br>them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes<br>which impel them to the separation.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:382;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft4">We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by<br>their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit<br>of Happiness.— That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving<br>their just powers from the consent of the governed,—  That whenever any Form of Government<br>becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to<br>institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in<br>such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence,<br>indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and<br>transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:573;left:109"><nobr><span class="ft4">suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they<br>are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same<br>Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right,  it is their duty,<br>to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.— Such has<br>been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains<br>them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great<br>Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the<br>establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a<br>candid world.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:785;left:163"><nobr><span class="ft4">He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the<br>public good.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:849;left:163"><nobr><span class="ft4">He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing<br>importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained;<br>and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:933;left:163"><nobr><span class="ft4">He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of<br>people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the<br>Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:1018;left:163"><nobr><span class="ft4">He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant<br>from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into<br>compliance with his measures.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:112;left:162"><nobr><span class="ft4">He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly<br>firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:176;left:162"><nobr><span class="ft4">He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be<br>elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned<br>to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time<br>exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:282;left:162"><nobr><span class="ft4">He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose<br>obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to<br>encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new<br>Appropriations of Lands.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:388;left:162"><nobr><span class="ft4">He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws<br>for establishing Judiciary powers.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:452;left:162"><nobr><span class="ft4">He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices,<br>and the amount and payment of their salaries.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:516;left:162"><nobr><span class="ft4">He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to<br>harrass our people, and eat out their substance.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:579;left:162"><nobr><span class="ft4">He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of<br>our legislatures.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:643;left:162"><nobr><span class="ft2">He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:685;left:162"><nobr><span class="ft4">He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our<br>constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of<br>pretended Legislation:</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:876;left:163"><nobr><span class="ft2">For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:919;left:163"><nobr><span class="ft4">For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent: For depriving us in many cases,<br>of the benefits of Trial by Jury:</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:982;left:163"><nobr><span class="ft2">For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:176;left:162"><nobr><span class="ft4">For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering<br>fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:240;left:162"><nobr><span class="ft4">For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with<br>power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:303;left:162"><nobr><span class="ft4">He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and<br>waging War against us.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:367;left:162"><nobr><span class="ft4">He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the<br>lives of our people.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:431;left:162"><nobr><span class="ft4">He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat<br>the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of<br>Cruelty &amp; perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally<br>unworthy of the Head of a civilized nation.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:537;left:162"><nobr><span class="ft4">He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear<br>Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and<br>Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:621;left:162"><nobr><span class="ft4">He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring<br>on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known<br>rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:706;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft4">In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms:<br>Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is<br>thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.<br>Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from<br>time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We<br>have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have<br>appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our<br>common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our<br>connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of<br>consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation,<br>and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.</span></nobr></DIV>
