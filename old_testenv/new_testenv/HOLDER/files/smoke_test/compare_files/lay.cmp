privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either 
House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place.

and proceed to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration 
two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall 
be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, 
by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved 
by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law. But in 
all such Cases the Votes of both Houses shall be determined 
by Yeas and Nays, and the Names of the Persons voting for 
and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each 
House respectively, If any Bill shall not be returned by the 
President within ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall 
have been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in 
like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by 
their Adjournament prevent its Return, in which Case it 
shall not be a Law. 

Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be 
necessary (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about one million dollars for each hour we work.  One
hundred hours is a conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar, then we produce a
million dollars per hour; next year we will have to do four text
files per month, thus upping our productivity to two million/hr.
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers.

All communication to Project Gutenberg should be carried out via
Illinois Benedictine College unless via email.  This is for help
in keeping me from being swept under by paper mail as follows:

1.  Too many people say they are including SASLE's and aren't.

2.  Paper communication just takes too long when compared to the
    thousands of lines of email I receive every day.  Even then,
    I can't communicate with people who take too long to respond
    as I just can't keep their trains of thought alive for those
    extended periods of time.  Even quick responses should reply
    with the text of the messages they are answering (reply text
    option in RiceMail).  This is more difficult with paper.

3.  People request disks without specifying which kind of disks,
    it can be very difficult to read an Apple disk on an IBM.  I
    have also received too many disks that cannot be formatted.

Why is this "small print" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us that we could get sued if there is something wrong
with your copy of this etext, even if what's wrong is not our
fault, and even if you got it for free and from someone other

FEDERALIST. No. 1

General Introduction
For the Independent Journal.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
AFTER an unequivocal experience of the inefficiency of the
 subsisting federal government, you are called upon to deliberate on
 a new Constitution for the United States of America. The subject
 speaks its own importance; comprehending in its consequences
 nothing less than the existence of the UNION, the safety and welfare
 of the parts of which it is composed, the fate of an empire in many
 respects the most interesting in the world. It has been frequently
 remarked that it seems to have been reserved to the people of this
 country, by their conduct and example, to decide the important
 question, whether societies of men are really capable or not of
 establishing good government from reflection and choice, or whether
 they are forever destined to depend for their political
 constitutions on accident and force. If there be any truth in the
 remark, the crisis at which we are arrived may with propriety be
 regarded as the era in which that decision is to be made; and a
 wrong election of the part we shall act may, in this view, deserve
 to be considered as the general misfortune of mankind.
This idea will add the inducements of philanthropy to those of
 patriotism, to heighten the solicitude which all considerate and
 good men must feel for the event. Happy will it be if our choice
 should be directed by a judicious estimate of our true interests,
 unperplexed and unbiased by considerations not connected with the
 public good. But this is a thing more ardently to be wished than
 seriously to be expected. The plan offered to our deliberations
 affects too many particular interests, innovates upon too many local
 institutions, not to involve in its discussion a variety of objects
 foreign to its merits, and of views, passions and prejudices little
 favorable to the discovery of truth.
Among the most formidable of the obstacles which the new
 Constitution will have to encounter may readily be distinguished the
 obvious interest of a certain class of men in every State to resist
 all changes which may hazard a diminution of the power, emolument,
 and consequence of the offices they hold under the State
 establishments; and the perverted ambition of another class of men,
 who will either hope to aggrandize themselves by the confusions of
 their country, or will flatter themselves with fairer prospects of
 elevation from the subdivision of the empire into several partial
 confederacies than from its union under one government.
It is not, however, my design to dwell upon observations of this
 nature. I am well aware that it would be disingenuous to resolve
 indiscriminately the opposition of any set of men (merely because
 their situations might subject them to suspicion) into interested or
 ambitious views. Candor will oblige us to admit that even such men
 may be actuated by upright intentions; and it cannot be doubted
 that much of the opposition which has made its appearance, or may
 hereafter make its appearance, will spring from sources, blameless
 at least, if not respectable--the honest errors of minds led astray
 by preconceived jealousies and fears. So numerous indeed and so
 powerful are the causes which serve to give a false bias to the
 judgment, that we, upon many occasions, see wise and good men on the
 wrong as well as on the right side of questions of the first
 magnitude to society. This circumstance, if duly attended to, would
 furnish a lesson of moderation to those who are ever so much
 persuaded of their being in the right in any controversy. And a
 further reason for caution, in this respect, might be drawn from the
 reflection that we are not always sure that those who advocate the
 truth are influenced by purer principles than their antagonists.
 Ambition, avarice, personal animosity, party opposition, and many
 other motives not more laudable than these, are apt to operate as
 well upon those who support as those who oppose the right side of a
 question. Were there not even these inducements to moderation,
 nothing could be more ill-judged than that intolerant spirit which
 has, at all times, characterized political parties. For in
 politics, as in religion, it is equally absurd to aim at making
 proselytes by fire and sword. Heresies in either can rarely be
 cured by persecution.
And yet, however just these sentiments will be allowed to be, we
 have already sufficient indications that it will happen in this as
 in all former cases of great national discussion. A torrent of
 angry and malignant passions will be let loose. To judge from the
 conduct of the opposite parties, we shall be led to conclude that
 they will mutually hope to evince the justness of their opinions,
 and to increase the number of their converts by the loudness of
 their declamations and the bitterness of their invectives. An
 enlightened zeal for the energy and efficiency of government will be
 stigmatized as the offspring of a temper fond of despotic power and
 hostile to the principles of liberty. An over-scrupulous jealousy
 of danger to the rights of the people, which is more commonly the
 fault of the head than of the heart, will be represented as mere
 pretense and artifice, the stale bait for popularity at the expense
 of the public good. It will be forgotten, on the one hand, that
 jealousy is the usual concomitant of love, and that the noble
 enthusiasm of liberty is apt to be infected with a spirit of narrow
 and illiberal distrust. On the other hand, it will be equally
 forgotten that the vigor of government is essential to the security
 of liberty; that, in the contemplation of a sound and well-informed
 judgment, their interest can never be separated; and that a
 dangerous ambition more often lurks behind the specious mask of zeal
 for the rights of the people than under the forbidden appearance of
 zeal for the firmness and efficiency of government. History will
 teach us that the former has been found a much more certain road to
 the introduction of despotism than the latter, and that of those men
 who have overturned the liberties of republics, the greatest number
 have begun their career by paying an obsequious court to the people;
 commencing demagogues, and ending tyrants.
In the course of the preceding observations, I have had an eye,
 my fellow-citizens, to putting you upon your guard against all
 attempts, from whatever quarter, to influence your decision in a
 matter of the utmost moment to your welfare, by any impressions
 other than those which may result from the evidence of truth. You
 will, no doubt, at the same time, have collected from the general
 scope of them, that they proceed from a source not unfriendly to the
 new Constitution. Yes, my countrymen, I own to you that, after
 having given it an attentive consideration, I am clearly of opinion
 it is your interest to adopt it. I am convinced that this is the
 safest course for your liberty, your dignity, and your happiness. I
 affect not reserves which I do not feel. I will not amuse you with
 an appearance of deliberation when I have decided. I frankly
 acknowledge to you my convictions, and I will freely lay before you
 the reasons on which they are founded. The consciousness of good
 intentions disdains ambiguity. I shall not, however, multiply
 professions on this head. My motives must remain in the depository
 of my own breast. My arguments will be open to all, and may be
 judged of by all. They shall at least be offered in a spirit which
 will not disgrace the cause of truth.
I propose, in a series of papers, to discuss the following
 interesting particulars: 
THE UTILITY OF THE UNION TO YOUR POLITICAL PROSPERITY
THE INSUFFICIENCY OF THE PRESENT CONFEDERATION
 TO PRESERVE THAT UNION  THE NECESSITY OF A GOVERNMENT AT LEAST
 EQUALLY ENERGETIC WITH THE ONE PROPOSED, TO THE ATTAINMENT OF THIS
 OBJECT  THE CONFORMITY OF THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTION TO THE TRUE
 PRINCIPLES OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT 
 ITS ANALOGY TO YOUR OWN STATE CONSTITUTION 
 and lastly, THE ADDITIONAL SECURITY WHICH ITS
 ADOPTION WILL AFFORD TO THE PRESERVATION OF THAT SPECIES OF
 GOVERNMENT, TO LIBERTY, AND TO PROPERTY.
In the progress of this discussion I shall endeavor to give a
 satisfactory answer to all the objections which shall have made
 their appearance, that may seem to have any claim to your attention.
It may perhaps be thought superfluous to offer arguments to
 prove the utility of the UNION, a point, no doubt, deeply engraved
 on the hearts of the great body of the people in every State, and
 one, which it may be imagined, has no adversaries. But the fact is,
 that we already hear it whispered in the private circles of those
 who oppose the new Constitution, that the thirteen States are of too
 great extent for any general system, and that we must of necessity
 resort to separate confederacies of distinct portions of the
 whole.1 This doctrine will, in all probability, be gradually
 propagated, till it has votaries enough to countenance an open
 avowal of it. For nothing can be more evident, to those who are
 able to take an enlarged view of the subject, than the alternative
 of an adoption of the new Constitution or a dismemberment of the
 Union. It will therefore be of use to begin by examining the
 advantages of that Union, the certain evils, and the probable
 dangers, to which every State will be exposed from its dissolution.
 This shall accordingly constitute the subject of my next address.
 PUBLIUS.
1 The same idea, tracing the arguments to their consequences, is
 held out in several of the late publications against the new
 Constitution.



FEDERALIST No. 2

Concerning Dangers from Foreign Force and Influence
For the Independent Journal.

JAY

To the People of the State of New York:
WHEN the people of America reflect that they are now called upon
 to decide a question, which, in its consequences, must prove one of
 the most important that ever engaged their attention, the propriety
 of their taking a very comprehensive, as well as a very serious,
 view of it, will be evident.
Nothing is more certain than the indispensable necessity of
 government, and it is equally undeniable, that whenever and however
 it is instituted, the people must cede to it some of their natural
 rights in order to vest it with requisite powers. It is well worthy
 of consideration therefore, whether it would conduce more to the
 interest of the people of America that they should, to all general
 purposes, be one nation, under one federal government, or that they
 should divide themselves into separate confederacies, and give to
 the head of each the same kind of powers which they are advised to
 place in one national government.
It has until lately been a received and uncontradicted opinion
 that the prosperity of the people of America depended on their
 continuing firmly united, and the wishes, prayers, and efforts of
 our best and wisest citizens have been constantly directed to that
 object. But politicians now appear, who insist that this opinion is
 erroneous, and that instead of looking for safety and happiness in
 union, we ought to seek it in a division of the States into distinct
 confederacies or sovereignties. However extraordinary this new
 doctrine may appear, it nevertheless has its advocates; and certain
 characters who were much opposed to it formerly, are at present of
 the number. Whatever may be the arguments or inducements which have
 wrought this change in the sentiments and declarations of these
 gentlemen, it certainly would not be wise in the people at large to
 adopt these new political tenets without being fully convinced that
 they are founded in truth and sound policy.
It has often given me pleasure to observe that independent
 America was not composed of detached and distant territories, but
 that one connected, fertile, widespreading country was the portion
 of our western sons of liberty. Providence has in a particular
 manner blessed it with a variety of soils and productions, and
 watered it with innumerable streams, for the delight and
 accommodation of its inhabitants. A succession of navigable waters
 forms a kind of chain round its borders, as if to bind it together;
 while the most noble rivers in the world, running at convenient
 distances, present them with highways for the easy communication of
 friendly aids, and the mutual transportation and exchange of their
 various commodities.
With equal pleasure I have as often taken notice that Providence
 has been pleased to give this one connected country to one united
 people--a people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same
 language, professing the same religion, attached to the same
 principles of government, very similar in their manners and customs,
 and who, by their joint counsels, arms, and efforts, fighting side
 by side throughout a long and bloody war, have nobly established
 general liberty and independence.
This country and this people seem to have been made for each
 other, and it appears as if it was the design of Providence, that an
 inheritance so proper and convenient for a band of brethren, united
 to each other by the strongest ties, should never be split into a
 number of unsocial, jealous, and alien sovereignties.
Similar sentiments have hitherto prevailed among all orders and
 denominations of men among us. To all general purposes we have
 uniformly been one people each individual citizen everywhere
 enjoying the same national rights, privileges, and protection. As a
 nation we have made peace and war; as a nation we have vanquished
 our common enemies; as a nation we have formed alliances, and made
 treaties, and entered into various compacts and conventions with
 foreign states.
A strong sense of the value and blessings of union induced the
 people, at a very early period, to institute a federal government to
 preserve and perpetuate it. They formed it almost as soon as they
 had a political existence; nay, at a time when their habitations
 were in flames, when many of their citizens were bleeding, and when
 the progress of hostility and desolation left little room for those
 calm and mature inquiries and reflections which must ever precede
 the formation of a wise and wellbalanced government for a free
 people. It is not to be wondered at, that a government instituted
 in times so inauspicious, should on experiment be found greatly
 deficient and inadequate to the purpose it was intended to answer.
This intelligent people perceived and regretted these defects.
 Still continuing no less attached to union than enamored of
 liberty, they observed the danger which immediately threatened the
 former and more remotely the latter; and being pursuaded that ample
 security for both could only be found in a national government more
 wisely framed, they as with one voice, convened the late convention
 at Philadelphia, to take that important subject under consideration.
This convention composed of men who possessed the confidence of
 the people, and many of whom had become highly distinguished by
 their patriotism, virtue and wisdom, in times which tried the minds
 and hearts of men, undertook the arduous task. In the mild season
 of peace, with minds unoccupied by other subjects, they passed many
 months in cool, uninterrupted, and daily consultation; and finally,
 without having been awed by power, or influenced by any passions
 except love for their country, they presented and recommended to the
 people the plan produced by their joint and very unanimous councils.
Admit, for so is the fact, that this plan is only RECOMMENDED,
 not imposed, yet let it be remembered that it is neither recommended
 to BLIND approbation, nor to BLIND reprobation; but to that sedate
 and candid consideration which the magnitude and importance of the
 subject demand, and which it certainly ought to receive. But this
 (as was remarked in the foregoing number of this paper) is more to
 be wished than expected, that it may be so considered and examined.
 Experience on a former occasion teaches us not to be too sanguine
 in such hopes. It is not yet forgotten that well-grounded
 apprehensions of imminent danger induced the people of America to
 form the memorable Congress of 1774. That body recommended certain
 measures to their constituents, and the event proved their wisdom;
 yet it is fresh in our memories how soon the press began to teem
 with pamphlets and weekly papers against those very measures. Not
 only many of the officers of government, who obeyed the dictates of
 personal interest, but others, from a mistaken estimate of
 consequences, or the undue influence of former attachments, or whose
 ambition aimed at objects which did not correspond with the public
 good, were indefatigable in their efforts to pursuade the people to
 reject the advice of that patriotic Congress. Many, indeed, were
 deceived and deluded, but the great majority of the people reasoned
 and decided judiciously; and happy they are in reflecting that they
 did so.
They considered that the Congress was composed of many wise and
 experienced men. That, being convened from different parts of the
 country, they brought with them and communicated to each other a
 variety of useful information. That, in the course of the time they
 passed together in inquiring into and discussing the true interests
 of their country, they must have acquired very accurate knowledge on
 that head. That they were individually interested in the public
 liberty and prosperity, and therefore that it was not less their
 inclination than their duty to recommend only such measures as,
 after the most mature deliberation, they really thought prudent and
 advisable.
These and similar considerations then induced the people to rely
 greatly on the judgment and integrity of the Congress; and they
 took their advice, notwithstanding the various arts and endeavors
 used to deter them from it. But if the people at large had reason
 to confide in the men of that Congress, few of whom had been fully
 tried or generally known, still greater reason have they now to
 respect the judgment and advice of the convention, for it is well
 known that some of the most distinguished members of that Congress,
 who have been since tried and justly approved for patriotism and
 abilities, and who have grown old in acquiring political
 information, were also members of this convention, and carried into
 it their accumulated knowledge and experience.
It is worthy of remark that not only the first, but every
 succeeding Congress, as well as the late convention, have invariably
 joined with the people in thinking that the prosperity of America
 depended on its Union. To preserve and perpetuate it was the great
 object of the people in forming that convention, and it is also the
 great object of the plan which the convention has advised them to
 adopt. With what propriety, therefore, or for what good purposes,
 are attempts at this particular period made by some men to
 depreciate the importance of the Union? Or why is it suggested that
 three or four confederacies would be better than one? I am
 persuaded in my own mind that the people have always thought right
 on this subject, and that their universal and uniform attachment to
 the cause of the Union rests on great and weighty reasons, which I
 shall endeavor to develop and explain in some ensuing papers. They
 who promote the idea of substituting a number of distinct
 confederacies in the room of the plan of the convention, seem
 clearly to foresee that the rejection of it would put the
 continuance of the Union in the utmost jeopardy. That certainly
 would be the case, and I sincerely wish that it may be as clearly
 foreseen by every good citizen, that whenever the dissolution of the
 Union arrives, America will have reason to exclaim, in the words of
 the poet: ``FAREWELL! A LONG FAREWELL TO ALL MY GREATNESS.''
PUBLIUS.


FEDERALIST No. 3

The Same Subject Continued
(Concerning Dangers From Foreign Force and Influence)
For the Independent Journal.

JAY

To the People of the State of New York:
IT IS not a new observation that the people of any country (if,
 like the Americans, intelligent and wellinformed) seldom adopt and
 steadily persevere for many years in an erroneous opinion respecting
 their interests. That consideration naturally tends to create great
 respect for the high opinion which the people of America have so
 long and uniformly entertained of the importance of their continuing
 firmly united under one federal government, vested with sufficient
 powers for all general and national purposes.
The more attentively I consider and investigate the reasons
 which appear to have given birth to this opinion, the more I become
 convinced that they are cogent and conclusive.
Among the many objects to which a wise and free people find it
 necessary to direct their attention, that of providing for their
 SAFETY seems to be the first. The SAFETY of the people doubtless
 has relation to a great variety of circumstances and considerations,
 and consequently affords great latitude to those who wish to define
 it precisely and comprehensively.
At present I mean only to consider it as it respects security
 for the preservation of peace and tranquillity, as well as against
 dangers from FOREIGN ARMS AND INFLUENCE, as from dangers of the LIKE
 KIND arising from domestic causes. As the former of these comes
 first in order, it is proper it should be the first discussed. Let
 us therefore proceed to examine whether the people are not right in
 their opinion that a cordial Union, under an efficient national
 government, affords them the best security that can be devised
 against HOSTILITIES from abroad.
The number of wars which have happened or will happen in the
 world will always be found to be in proportion to the number and
 weight of the causes, whether REAL or PRETENDED, which PROVOKE or
 INVITE them. If this remark be just, it becomes useful to inquire
 whether so many JUST causes of war are likely to be given by UNITED
 AMERICA as by DISUNITED America; for if it should turn out that
 United America will probably give the fewest, then it will follow
 that in this respect the Union tends most to preserve the people in
 a state of peace with other nations.
The JUST causes of war, for the most part, arise either from
 violation of treaties or from direct violence. America has already
 formed treaties with no less than six foreign nations, and all of
 them, except Prussia, are maritime, and therefore able to annoy and
 injure us. She has also extensive commerce with Portugal, Spain,
 and Britain, and, with respect to the two latter, has, in addition,
 the circumstance of neighborhood to attend to.
It is of high importance to the peace of America that she
 observe the laws of nations towards all these powers, and to me it
 appears evident that this will be more perfectly and punctually done
 by one national government than it could be either by thirteen
 separate States or by three or four distinct confederacies.
Because when once an efficient national government is
 established, the best men in the country will not only consent to
 serve, but also will generally be appointed to manage it; for,
 although town or country, or other contracted influence, may place
 men in State assemblies, or senates, or courts of justice, or
 executive departments, yet more general and extensive reputation for
 talents and other qualifications will be necessary to recommend men
 to offices under the national government,--especially as it will have
 the widest field for choice, and never experience that want of
 proper persons which is not uncommon in some of the States. Hence,
 it will result that the administration, the political counsels, and
 the judicial decisions of the national government will be more wise,
 systematical, and judicious than those of individual States, and
 consequently more satisfactory with respect to other nations, as
 well as more SAFE with respect to us.
Because, under the national government, treaties and articles of
 treaties, as well as the laws of nations, will always be expounded
 in one sense and executed in the same manner,--whereas, adjudications
 on the same points and questions, in thirteen States, or in three or
 four confederacies, will not always accord or be consistent; and
 that, as well from the variety of independent courts and judges
 appointed by different and independent governments, as from the
 different local laws and interests which may affect and influence
 them. The wisdom of the convention, in committing such questions to
 the jurisdiction and judgment of courts appointed by and responsible
 only to one national government, cannot be too much commended.
Because the prospect of present loss or advantage may often
 tempt the governing party in one or two States to swerve from good
 faith and justice; but those temptations, not reaching the other
 States, and consequently having little or no influence on the
 national government, the temptation will be fruitless, and good
 faith and justice be preserved. The case of the treaty of peace
 with Britain adds great weight to this reasoning.
Because, even if the governing party in a State should be
 disposed to resist such temptations, yet as such temptations may,
 and commonly do, result from circumstances peculiar to the State,
 and may affect a great number of the inhabitants, the governing
 party may not always be able, if willing, to prevent the injustice
 meditated, or to punish the aggressors. But the national
 government, not being affected by those local circumstances, will
 neither be induced to commit the wrong themselves, nor want power or
 inclination to prevent or punish its commission by others.
So far, therefore, as either designed or accidental violations
 of treaties and the laws of nations afford JUST causes of war, they
 are less to be apprehended under one general government than under
 several lesser ones, and in that respect the former most favors the
 SAFETY of the people.
As to those just causes of war which proceed from direct and
 unlawful violence, it appears equally clear to me that one good
 national government affords vastly more security against dangers of
 that sort than can be derived from any other quarter.
Because such violences are more frequently caused by the
 passions and interests of a part than of the whole; of one or two
 States than of the Union. Not a single Indian war has yet been
 occasioned by aggressions of the present federal government, feeble
 as it is; but there are several instances of Indian hostilities
 having been provoked by the improper conduct of individual States,
 who, either unable or unwilling to restrain or punish offenses, have
 given occasion to the slaughter of many innocent inhabitants.
The neighborhood of Spanish and British territories, bordering
 on some States and not on others, naturally confines the causes of
 quarrel more immediately to the borderers. The bordering States, if
 any, will be those who, under the impulse of sudden irritation, and
 a quick sense of apparent interest or injury, will be most likely,
 by direct violence, to excite war with these nations; and nothing
 can so effectually obviate that danger as a national government,
 whose wisdom and prudence will not be diminished by the passions
 which actuate the parties immediately interested.
But not only fewer just causes of war will be given by the
 national government, but it will also be more in their power to
 accommodate and settle them amicably. They will be more temperate
 and cool, and in that respect, as well as in others, will be more in
 capacity to act advisedly than the offending State. The pride of
 states, as well as of men, naturally disposes them to justify all
 their actions, and opposes their acknowledging, correcting, or
 repairing their errors and offenses. The national government, in
 such cases, will not be affected by this pride, but will proceed
 with moderation and candor to consider and decide on the means most
 proper to extricate them from the difficulties which threaten them.
Besides, it is well known that acknowledgments, explanations,
 and compensations are often accepted as satisfactory from a strong
 united nation, which would be rejected as unsatisfactory if offered
 by a State or confederacy of little consideration or power.
In the year 1685, the state of Genoa having offended Louis XIV.,
 endeavored to appease him. He demanded that they should send their
 Doge, or chief magistrate, accompanied by four of their
 senators, to FRANCE, to ask his pardon and receive his terms. They
 were obliged to submit to it for the sake of peace. Would he on any
 occasion either have demanded or have received the like humiliation
 from Spain, or Britain, or any other POWERFUL nation?

For the Independent Journal.

JAY

To the People of the State of New York:
MY LAST paper assigned several reasons why the safety of the
 people would be best secured by union against the danger it may be
 exposed to by JUST causes of war given to other nations; and those
 reasons show that such causes would not only be more rarely given,
 but would also be more easily accommodated, by a national government
 than either by the State governments or the proposed little
 confederacies.
But the safety of the people of America against dangers from
 FOREIGN force depends not only on their forbearing to give JUST
 causes of war to other nations, but also on their placing and
 continuing themselves in such a situation as not to INVITE hostility
 or insult; for it need not be observed that there are PRETENDED as
 well as just causes of war.
It is too true, however disgraceful it may be to human nature,
 that nations in general will make war whenever they have a prospect
 of getting anything by it; nay, absolute monarchs will often make
 war when their nations are to get nothing by it, but for the
 purposes and objects merely personal, such as thirst for military
 glory, revenge for personal affronts, ambition, or private compacts
 to aggrandize or support their particular families or partisans.
 These and a variety of other motives, which affect only the mind of
 the sovereign, often lead him to engage in wars not sanctified by
 justice or the voice and interests of his people. But, independent
 of these inducements to war, which are more prevalent in absolute
 monarchies, but which well deserve our attention, there are others
 which affect nations as often as kings; and some of them will on
 examination be found to grow out of our relative situation and
 circumstances.
With France and with Britain we are rivals in the fisheries, and
 can supply their markets cheaper than they can themselves,
 notwithstanding any efforts to prevent it by bounties on their own
 or duties on foreign fish.
With them and with most other European nations we are rivals in
 navigation and the carrying trade; and we shall deceive ourselves
 if we suppose that any of them will rejoice to see it flourish;
 for, as our carrying trade cannot increase without in some degree
 diminishing theirs, it is more their interest, and will be more
 their policy, to restrain than to promote it.
In the trade to China and India, we interfere with more than one
 nation, inasmuch as it enables us to partake in advantages which
 they had in a manner monopolized, and as we thereby supply ourselves
 with commodities which we used to purchase from them.
The extension of our own commerce in our own vessels cannot give
 pleasure to any nations who possess territories on or near this
 continent, because the cheapness and excellence of our productions,
 added to the circumstance of vicinity, and the enterprise and
 address of our merchants and navigators, will give us a greater
 share in the advantages which those territories afford, than
 consists with the wishes or policy of their respective sovereigns.
Spain thinks it convenient to shut the Mississippi against us on
 the one side, and Britain excludes us from the Saint Lawrence on the
 other; nor will either of them permit the other waters which are
 between them and us to become the means of mutual intercourse and
 traffic.
From these and such like considerations, which might, if
 consistent with prudence, be more amplified and detailed, it is easy
 to see that jealousies and uneasinesses may gradually slide into the
 minds and cabinets of other nations, and that we are not to expect
 that they should regard our advancement in union, in power and
 consequence by land and by sea, with an eye of indifference and
 composure.
The people of America are aware that inducements to war may
 arise out of these circumstances, as well as from others not so
 obvious at present, and that whenever such inducements may find fit
 time and opportunity for operation, pretenses to color and justify
 them will not be wanting. Wisely, therefore, do they consider union
 and a good national government as necessary to put and keep them in
 SUCH A SITUATION as, instead of INVITING war, will tend to repress
 and discourage it. That situation consists in the best possible
 state of defense, and necessarily depends on the government, the
 arms, and the resources of the country.
As the safety of the whole is the interest of the whole, and
 cannot be provided for without government, either one or more or
 many, let us inquire whether one good government is not, relative to
 the object in question, more competent than any other given number
 whatever.
One government can collect and avail itself of the talents and
 experience of the ablest men, in whatever part of the Union they may
 be found. It can move on uniform principles of policy. It can
 harmonize, assimilate, and protect the several parts and members,
 and extend the benefit of its foresight and precautions to each. In
 the formation of treaties, it will regard the interest of the whole,
 and the particular interests of the parts as connected with that of
 the whole. It can apply the resources and power of the whole to the
 defense of any particular part, and that more easily and
 expeditiously than State governments or separate confederacies can
 possibly do, for want of concert and unity of system. It can place
 the militia under one plan of discipline, and, by putting their
 officers in a proper line of subordination to the Chief Magistrate,
 will, as it were, consolidate them into one corps, and thereby
 render them more efficient than if divided into thirteen or into
 three or four distinct independent companies.
What would the militia of Britain be if the English militia
 obeyed the government of England, if the Scotch militia obeyed the
 government of Scotland, and if the Welsh militia obeyed the
 government of Wales? Suppose an invasion; would those three
 governments (if they agreed at all) be able, with all their
 respective forces, to operate against the enemy so effectually as
 the single government of Great Britain would?
We have heard much of the fleets of Britain, and the time may
 come, if we are wise, when the fleets of America may engage
 attention. But if one national government, had not so regulated the
 navigation of Britain as to make it a nursery for seamen--if one
 national government had not called forth all the national means and
 materials for forming fleets, their prowess and their thunder would
 never have been celebrated. Let England have its navigation and
 fleet--let Scotland have its navigation and fleet--let Wales have its
 navigation and fleet--let Ireland have its navigation and fleet--let
 those four of the constituent parts of the British empire be be
 under four independent governments, and it is easy to perceive how
 soon they would each dwindle into comparative insignificance.
Apply these facts to our own case. Leave America divided into
 thirteen or, if you please, into three or four independent
 governments--what armies could they raise and pay--what fleets could
 they ever hope to have? If one was attacked, would the others fly
 to its succor, and spend their blood and money in its defense?
 Would there be no danger of their being flattered into neutrality
 by its specious promises, or seduced by a too great fondness for
 peace to decline hazarding their tranquillity and present safety for
 the sake of neighbors, of whom perhaps they have been jealous, and
 whose importance they are content to see diminished? Although such
 conduct would not be wise, it would, nevertheless, be natural. The
 history of the states of Greece, and of other countries, abounds
 with such instances, and it is not improbable that what has so often
 happened would, under similar circumstances, happen again.
But admit that they might be willing to help the invaded State
 or confederacy. How, and when, and in what proportion shall aids of
 men and money be afforded? Who shall command the allied armies, and
 from which of them shall he receive his orders? Who shall settle
 the terms of peace, and in case of disputes what umpire shall decide
 between them and compel acquiescence? Various difficulties and
 inconveniences would be inseparable from such a situation; whereas
 one government, watching over the general and common interests, and
 combining and directing the powers and resources of the whole, would
 be free from all these embarrassments, and conduce far more to the
 safety of the people.
But whatever may be our situation, whether firmly united under
 one national government, or split into a number of confederacies,
 certain it is, that foreign nations will know and view it exactly as
 it is; and they will act toward us accordingly. If they see that
 our national government is efficient and well administered, our
 trade prudently regulated, our militia properly organized and
 disciplined, our resources and finances discreetly managed, our
 credit re-established, our people free, contented, and united, they
 will be much more disposed to cultivate our friendship than provoke
 our resentment. If, on the other hand, they find us either
 destitute of an effectual government (each State doing right or
 wrong, as to its rulers may seem convenient), or split into three or
 four independent and probably discordant republics or confederacies,
 one inclining to Britain, another to France, and a third to Spain,
 and perhaps played off against each other by the three, what a poor,
 pitiful figure will America make in their eyes! How liable would
 she become not only to their contempt but to their outrage, and how
 soon would dear-bought experience proclaim that when a people or
 family so divide, it never fails to be against themselves.

JAY

To the People of the State of New York:
QUEEN ANNE, in her letter of the 1st July, 1706, to the Scotch
 Parliament, makes some observations on the importance of the UNION
 then forming between England and Scotland, which merit our attention. 
 I shall present the public with one or two extracts from it: ``An
 entire and perfect union will be the solid foundation of lasting
 peace: It will secure your religion, liberty, and property; remove
 the animosities amongst yourselves, and the jealousies and
 differences betwixt our two kingdoms. It must increase your
 strength, riches, and trade; and by this union the whole island,
 being joined in affection and free from all apprehensions of
 different interest, will be ENABLED TO RESIST ALL ITS ENEMIES.''
 ``We most earnestly recommend to you calmness and unanimity in this
 great and weighty affair, that the union may be brought to a happy
 conclusion, being the only EFFECTUAL way to secure our present and
 future happiness, and disappoint the designs of our and your
 enemies, who will doubtless, on this occasion, USE THEIR UTMOST
 ENDEAVORS TO PREVENT OR DELAY THIS UNION.''
It was remarked in the preceding paper, that weakness and
 divisions at home would invite dangers from abroad; and that
 nothing would tend more to secure us from them than union, strength,
 and good government within ourselves. This subject is copious and
 cannot easily be exhausted.
The history of Great Britain is the one with which we are in
 general the best acquainted, and it gives us many useful lessons.
 We may profit by their experience without paying the price which it
 cost them. Although it seems obvious to common sense that the
 people of such an island should be but one nation, yet we find that
 they were for ages divided into three, and that those three were
 almost constantly embroiled in quarrels and wars with one another.
 Notwithstanding their true interest with respect to the continental
 nations was really the same, yet by the arts and policy and
 practices of those nations, their mutual jealousies were perpetually
 kept inflamed, and for a long series of years they were far more
 inconvenient and troublesome than they were useful and assisting to
 each other.
Should the people of America divide themselves into three or
 four nations, would not the same thing happen? Would not similar
 jealousies arise, and be in like manner cherished? Instead of their
 being ``joined in affection'' and free from all apprehension of
 different ``interests,'' envy and jealousy would soon extinguish
 confidence and affection, and the partial interests of each
 confederacy, instead of the general interests of all America, would
 be the only objects of their policy and pursuits. Hence, like most
 other BORDERING nations, they would always be either involved in
 disputes and war, or live in the constant apprehension of them.
The most sanguine advocates for three or four confederacies
 cannot reasonably suppose that they would long remain exactly on an
 equal footing in point of strength, even if it was possible to form
 them so at first; but, admitting that to be practicable, yet what
 human contrivance can secure the continuance of such equality?
 Independent of those local circumstances which tend to beget and
 increase power in one part and to impede its progress in another, we
 must advert to the effects of that superior policy and good
 management which would probably distinguish the government of one
 above the rest, and by which their relative equality in strength and
 consideration would be destroyed. For it cannot be presumed that
 the same degree of sound policy, prudence, and foresight would
 uniformly be observed by each of these confederacies for a long
 succession of years.
Whenever, and from whatever causes, it might happen, and happen
 it would, that any one of these nations or confederacies should rise
 on the scale of political importance much above the degree of her
 neighbors, that moment would those neighbors behold her with envy
 and with fear. Both those passions would lead them to countenance,
 if not to promote, whatever might promise to diminish her
 importance; and would also restrain them from measures calculated
 to advance or even to secure her prosperity. Much time would not be
 necessary to enable her to discern these unfriendly dispositions.
 She would soon begin, not only to lose confidence in her neighbors,
 but also to feel a disposition equally unfavorable to them.
 Distrust naturally creates distrust, and by nothing is good-will
 and kind conduct more speedily changed than by invidious jealousies
 and uncandid imputations, whether expressed or implied.
The North is generally the region of strength, and many local
 circumstances render it probable that the most Northern of the
 proposed confederacies would, at a period not very distant, be
 unquestionably more formidable than any of the others. No sooner
 would this become evident than the NORTHERN HIVE would excite the
 same ideas and sensations in the more southern parts of America
 which it formerly did in the southern parts of Europe. Nor does it
 appear to be a rash conjecture that its young swarms might often be
 tempted to gather honey in the more blooming fields and milder air
 of their luxurious and more delicate neighbors.
They who well consider the history of similar divisions and
 confederacies will find abundant reason to apprehend that those in
 contemplation would in no other sense be neighbors than as they
 would be borderers; that they would neither love nor trust one
 another, but on the contrary would be a prey to discord, jealousy,
 and mutual injuries; in short, that they would place us exactly in
 the situations in which some nations doubtless wish to see us, viz.,
 FORMIDABLE ONLY TO EACH OTHER.
From these considerations it appears that those gentlemen are
 greatly mistaken who suppose that alliances offensive and defensive
 might be formed between these confederacies, and would produce that
 combination and union of wills of arms and of resources, which would
 be necessary to put and keep them in a formidable state of defense
 against foreign enemies.
When did the independent states, into which Britain and Spain
 were formerly divided, combine in such alliance, or unite their
 forces against a foreign enemy? The proposed confederacies will be
 DISTINCT NATIONS. Each of them would have its commerce with
 foreigners to regulate by distinct treaties; and as their
 productions and commodities are different and proper for different
 markets, so would those treaties be essentially different.
 Different commercial concerns must create different interests, and
 of course different degrees of political attachment to and
 connection with different foreign nations. Hence it might and
 probably would happen that the foreign nation with whom the SOUTHERN
 confederacy might be at war would be the one with whom the NORTHERN
 confederacy would be the most desirous of preserving peace and
 friendship. An alliance so contrary to their immediate interest
 would not therefore be easy to form, nor, if formed, would it be
 observed and fulfilled with perfect good faith.
Nay, it is far more probable that in America, as in Europe,
 neighboring nations, acting under the impulse of opposite interests
 and unfriendly passions, would frequently be found taking different
 sides. Considering our distance from Europe, it would be more
 natural for these confederacies to apprehend danger from one another
 than from distant nations, and therefore that each of them should be
 more desirous to guard against the others by the aid of foreign
 alliances, than to guard against foreign dangers by alliances
 between themselves. And here let us not forget how much more easy
 it is to receive foreign fleets into our ports, and foreign armies
 into our country, than it is to persuade or compel them to depart.
 How many conquests did the Romans and others make in the characters
 of allies, and what innovations did they under the same character
 introduce into the governments of those whom they pretended to
 protect.
Let candid men judge, then, whether the division of America into
 any given number of independent sovereignties would tend to secure
 us against the hostilities and improper interference of foreign
 nations.

FEDERALIST No. 6

Concerning Dangers from Dissensions Between the States
For the Independent Journal.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
THE three last numbers of this paper have been dedicated to an
 enumeration of the dangers to which we should be exposed, in a state
 of disunion, from the arms and arts of foreign nations. I shall now
 proceed to delineate dangers of a different and, perhaps, still more
 alarming kind--those which will in all probability flow from
 dissensions between the States themselves, and from domestic
 factions and convulsions. These have been already in some instances
 slightly anticipated; but they deserve a more particular and more
 full investigation.
A man must be far gone in Utopian speculations who can seriously
 doubt that, if these States should either be wholly disunited, or
 only united in partial confederacies, the subdivisions into which
 they might be thrown would have frequent and violent contests with
 each other. To presume a want of motives for such contests as an
 argument against their existence, would be to forget that men are
 ambitious, vindictive, and rapacious. To look for a continuation of
 harmony between a number of independent, unconnected sovereignties
 in the same neighborhood, would be to disregard the uniform course
 of human events, and to set at defiance the accumulated experience
 of ages.
The causes of hostility among nations are innumerable. There
 are some which have a general and almost constant operation upon the
 collective bodies of society. Of this description are the love of
 power or the desire of pre-eminence and dominion--the jealousy of
 power, or the desire of equality and safety. There are others which
 have a more circumscribed though an equally operative influence
 within their spheres. Such are the rivalships and competitions of
 commerce between commercial nations. And there are others, not less
 numerous than either of the former, which take their origin entirely
 in private passions; in the attachments, enmities, interests,
 hopes, and fears of leading individuals in the communities of which
 they are members. Men of this class, whether the favorites of a
 king or of a people, have in too many instances abused the
 confidence they possessed; and assuming the pretext of some public
 motive, have not scrupled to sacrifice the national tranquillity to
 personal advantage or personal gratification.
The celebrated Pericles, in compliance with the resentment of a
 prostitute,1 at the expense of much of the blood and treasure of
 his countrymen, attacked, vanquished, and destroyed the city of the
 SAMNIANS. The same man, stimulated by private pique against the
 MEGARENSIANS,2 another nation of Greece, or to avoid a
 prosecution with which he was threatened as an accomplice of a
 supposed theft of the statuary Phidias,3 or to get rid of the
 accusations prepared to be brought against him for dissipating the
 funds of the state in the purchase of popularity,4 or from a
 combination of all these causes, was the primitive author of that
 famous and fatal war, distinguished in the Grecian annals by the
 name of the PELOPONNESIAN war; which, after various vicissitudes,
 intermissions, and renewals, terminated in the ruin of the Athenian
 commonwealth.
The ambitious cardinal, who was prime minister to Henry VIII.,
 permitting his vanity to aspire to the triple crown,5
 entertained hopes of succeeding in the acquisition of that splendid
 prize by the influence of the Emperor Charles V. To secure the
 favor and interest of this enterprising and powerful monarch, he
 precipitated England into a war with France, contrary to the
 plainest dictates of policy, and at the hazard of the safety and
 independence, as well of the kingdom over which he presided by his
 counsels, as of Europe in general. For if there ever was a
 sovereign who bid fair to realize the project of universal monarchy,
 it was the Emperor Charles V., of whose intrigues Wolsey was at once
 the instrument and the dupe.
The influence which the bigotry of one female,6 the
 petulance of another,7 and the cabals of a third,8 had in
 the contemporary policy, ferments, and pacifications, of a
 considerable part of Europe, are topics that have been too often
 descanted upon not to be generally known.
To multiply examples of the agency of personal considerations in
 the production of great national events, either foreign or domestic,
 according to their direction, would be an unnecessary waste of time.
 Those who have but a superficial acquaintance with the sources from
 which they are to be drawn, will themselves recollect a variety of
 instances; and those who have a tolerable knowledge of human nature
 will not stand in need of such lights to form their opinion either
 of the reality or extent of that agency. Perhaps, however, a
 reference, tending to illustrate the general principle, may with
 propriety be made to a case which has lately happened among
 ourselves. If Shays had not been a DESPERATE DEBTOR, it is much to
 be doubted whether Massachusetts would have been plunged into a
 civil war.
But notwithstanding the concurring testimony of experience, in
 this particular, there are still to be found visionary or designing
 men, who stand ready to advocate the paradox of perpetual peace
 between the States, though dismembered and alienated from each other. 
 The genius of republics (say they) is pacific; the spirit of
 commerce has a tendency to soften the manners of men, and to
 extinguish those inflammable humors which have so often kindled into
 wars. Commercial republics, like ours, will never be disposed to
 waste themselves in ruinous contentions with each other. They will
 be governed by mutual interest, and will cultivate a spirit of
 mutual amity and concord.
Is it not (we may ask these projectors in politics) the true
 interest of all nations to cultivate the same benevolent and
 philosophic spirit? If this be their true interest, have they in
 fact pursued it? Has it not, on the contrary, invariably been found
 that momentary passions, and immediate interest, have a more active
 and imperious control over human conduct than general or remote
 considerations of policy, utility or justice? Have republics in
 practice been less addicted to war than monarchies? Are not the
 former administered by MEN as well as the latter? Are there not
 aversions, predilections, rivalships, and desires of unjust
 acquisitions, that affect nations as well as kings? Are not popular
 assemblies frequently subject to the impulses of rage, resentment,
 jealousy, avarice, and of other irregular and violent propensities?
 Is it not well known that their determinations are often governed
 by a few individuals in whom they place confidence, and are, of
 course, liable to be tinctured by the passions and views of those
 individuals? Has commerce hitherto done anything more than change
 the objects of war? Is not the love of wealth as domineering and
 enterprising a passion as that of power or glory? Have there not
 been as many wars founded upon commercial motives since that has
 become the prevailing system of nations, as were before occasioned
 by the cupidity of territory or dominion? Has not the spirit of
 commerce, in many instances, administered new incentives to the
 appetite, both for the one and for the other? Let experience, the
 least fallible guide of human opinions, be appealed to for an answer
 to these inquiries.
Sparta, Athens, Rome, and Carthage were all republics; two of
 them, Athens and Carthage, of the commercial kind. Yet were they as
 often engaged in wars, offensive and defensive, as the neighboring
 monarchies of the same times. Sparta was little better than a
 wellregulated camp; and Rome was never sated of carnage and
 conquest.
Carthage, though a commercial republic, was the aggressor in the
 very war that ended in her destruction. Hannibal had carried her
 arms into the heart of Italy and to the gates of Rome, before
 Scipio, in turn, gave him an overthrow in the territories of
 Carthage, and made a conquest of the commonwealth.
Venice, in later times, figured more than once in wars of
 ambition, till, becoming an object to the other Italian states, Pope
 Julius II. found means to accomplish that formidable league,9
 which gave a deadly blow to the power and pride of this haughty
 republic.
The provinces of Holland, till they were overwhelmed in debts
 and taxes, took a leading and conspicuous part in the wars of Europe. 
 They had furious contests with England for the dominion of the
 sea, and were among the most persevering and most implacable of the
 opponents of Louis XIV.
In the government of Britain the representatives of the people
 compose one branch of the national legislature. Commerce has been
 for ages the predominant pursuit of that country. Few nations,
 nevertheless, have been more frequently engaged in war; and the
 wars in which that kingdom has been engaged have, in numerous
 instances, proceeded from the people.
There have been, if I may so express it, almost as many popular
 as royal wars. The cries of the nation and the importunities of
 their representatives have, upon various occasions, dragged their
 monarchs into war, or continued them in it, contrary to their
 inclinations, and sometimes contrary to the real interests of the
 State. In that memorable struggle for superiority between the rival
 houses of AUSTRIA and BOURBON, which so long kept Europe in a flame,
 it is well known that the antipathies of the English against the
 French, seconding the ambition, or rather the avarice, of a favorite
 leader,10 protracted the war beyond the limits marked out by
 sound policy, and for a considerable time in opposition to the views
 of the court.
The wars of these two last-mentioned nations have in a great
 measure grown out of commercial considerations,--the desire of
 supplanting and the fear of being supplanted, either in particular
 branches of traffic or in the general advantages of trade and
 navigation.
From this summary of what has taken place in other countries,
 whose situations have borne the nearest resemblance to our own, what
 reason can we have to confide in those reveries which would seduce
 us into an expectation of peace and cordiality between the members
 of the present confederacy, in a state of separation? Have we not
 already seen enough of the fallacy and extravagance of those idle
 theories which have amused us with promises of an exemption from the
 imperfections, weaknesses and evils incident to society in every
 shape? Is it not time to awake from the deceitful dream of a golden
 age, and to adopt as a practical maxim for the direction of our
 political conduct that we, as well as the other inhabitants of the
 globe, are yet remote from the happy empire of perfect wisdom and
 perfect virtue?
Let the point of extreme depression to which our national
 dignity and credit have sunk, let the inconveniences felt everywhere
 from a lax and ill administration of government, let the revolt of a
 part of the State of North Carolina, the late menacing disturbances
 in Pennsylvania, and the actual insurrections and rebellions in
 Massachusetts, declare--!
So far is the general sense of mankind from corresponding with
 the tenets of those who endeavor to lull asleep our apprehensions of
 discord and hostility between the States, in the event of disunion,
 that it has from long observation of the progress of society become
 a sort of axiom in politics, that vicinity or nearness of situation,
 constitutes nations natural enemies. An intelligent writer
 expresses himself on this subject to this effect: ``NEIGHBORING
 NATIONS (says he) are naturally enemies of each other unless their
 common weakness forces them to league in a CONFEDERATE REPUBLIC, and
 their constitution prevents the differences that neighborhood
 occasions, extinguishing that secret jealousy which disposes all
 states to aggrandize themselves at the expense of their
 neighbors.''11 This passage, at the same time, points out the
 EVIL and suggests the REMEDY.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
IT IS sometimes asked, with an air of seeming triumph, what
 inducements could the States have, if disunited, to make war upon
 each other? It would be a full answer to this question to
 say--precisely the same inducements which have, at different times,
 deluged in blood all the nations in the world. But, unfortunately
 for us, the question admits of a more particular answer. There are
 causes of differences within our immediate contemplation, of the
 tendency of which, even under the restraints of a federal
 constitution, we have had sufficient experience to enable us to form
 a judgment of what might be expected if those restraints were
 removed.
Territorial disputes have at all times been found one of the
 most fertile sources of hostility among nations. Perhaps the
 greatest proportion of wars that have desolated the earth have
 sprung from this origin. This cause would exist among us in full
 force. We have a vast tract of unsettled territory within the
 boundaries of the United States. There still are discordant and
 undecided claims between several of them, and the dissolution of the
 Union would lay a foundation for similar claims between them all.
 It is well known that they have heretofore had serious and animated
 discussion concerning the rights to the lands which were ungranted
 at the time of the Revolution, and which usually went under the name
 of crown lands. The States within the limits of whose colonial
 governments they were comprised have claimed them as their property,
 the others have contended that the rights of the crown in this
 article devolved upon the Union; especially as to all that part of
 the Western territory which, either by actual possession, or through
 the submission of the Indian proprietors, was subjected to the
 jurisdiction of the king of Great Britain, till it was relinquished
 in the treaty of peace. This, it has been said, was at all events
 an acquisition to the Confederacy by compact with a foreign power.
 It has been the prudent policy of Congress to appease this
 controversy, by prevailing upon the States to make cessions to the
 United States for the benefit of the whole. This has been so far
 accomplished as, under a continuation of the Union, to afford a
 decided prospect of an amicable termination of the dispute. A
 dismemberment of the Confederacy, however, would revive this
 dispute, and would create others on the same subject. At present, a
 large part of the vacant Western territory is, by cession at least,
 if not by any anterior right, the common property of the Union. If
 that were at an end, the States which made the cession, on a
 principle of federal compromise, would be apt when the motive of the
 grant had ceased, to reclaim the lands as a reversion. The other
 States would no doubt insist on a proportion, by right of
 representation. Their argument would be, that a grant, once made,
 could not be revoked; and that the justice of participating in
 territory acquired or secured by the joint efforts of the
 Confederacy, remained undiminished. If, contrary to probability, it
 should be admitted by all the States, that each had a right to a
 share of this common stock, there would still be a difficulty to be
 surmounted, as to a proper rule of apportionment. Different
 principles would be set up by different States for this purpose;
 and as they would affect the opposite interests of the parties,
 they might not easily be susceptible of a pacific adjustment.
In the wide field of Western territory, therefore, we perceive
 an ample theatre for hostile pretensions, without any umpire or
 common judge to interpose between the contending parties. To reason
 from the past to the future, we shall have good ground to apprehend,
 that the sword would sometimes be appealed to as the arbiter of
 their differences. The circumstances of the dispute between
 Connecticut and Pennsylvania, respecting the land at Wyoming,
 admonish us not to be sanguine in expecting an easy accommodation of
 such differences. The articles of confederation obliged the parties
 to submit the matter to the decision of a federal court. The
 submission was made, and the court decided in favor of Pennsylvania.
 But Connecticut gave strong indications of dissatisfaction with
 that determination; nor did she appear to be entirely resigned to
 it, till, by negotiation and management, something like an
 equivalent was found for the loss she supposed herself to have
 sustained. Nothing here said is intended to convey the slightest
 censure on the conduct of that State. She no doubt sincerely
 believed herself to have been injured by the decision; and States,
 like individuals, acquiesce with great reluctance in determinations
 to their disadvantage.
Those who had an opportunity of seeing the inside of the
 transactions which attended the progress of the controversy between
 this State and the district of Vermont, can vouch the opposition we
 experienced, as well from States not interested as from those which
 were interested in the claim; and can attest the danger to which
 the peace of the Confederacy might have been exposed, had this State
 attempted to assert its rights by force. Two motives preponderated
 in that opposition: one, a jealousy entertained of our future
 power; and the other, the interest of certain individuals of
 influence in the neighboring States, who had obtained grants of
 lands under the actual government of that district. Even the States
 which brought forward claims, in contradiction to ours, seemed more
 solicitous to dismember this State, than to establish their own
 pretensions. These were New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and
 Connecticut. New Jersey and Rhode Island, upon all occasions,
 discovered a warm zeal for the independence of Vermont; and
 Maryland, till alarmed by the appearance of a connection between
 Canada and that State, entered deeply into the same views. These
 being small States, saw with an unfriendly eye the perspective of
 our growing greatness. In a review of these transactions we may
 trace some of the causes which would be likely to embroil the States
 with each other, if it should be their unpropitious destiny to
 become disunited.
The competitions of commerce would be another fruitful source of
 contention. The States less favorably circumstanced would be
 desirous of escaping from the disadvantages of local situation, and
 of sharing in the advantages of their more fortunate neighbors.
 Each State, or separate confederacy, would pursue a system of
 commercial policy peculiar to itself. This would occasion
 distinctions, preferences, and exclusions, which would beget
 discontent. The habits of intercourse, on the basis of equal
 privileges, to which we have been accustomed since the earliest
 settlement of the country, would give a keener edge to those causes
 of discontent than they would naturally have independent of this
 circumstance. WE SHOULD BE READY TO DENOMINATE INJURIES THOSE
 THINGS WHICH WERE IN REALITY THE JUSTIFIABLE ACTS OF INDEPENDENT
 SOVEREIGNTIES CONSULTING A DISTINCT INTEREST. The spirit of
 enterprise, which characterizes the commercial part of America, has
 left no occasion of displaying itself unimproved. It is not at all
 probable that this unbridled spirit would pay much respect to those
 regulations of trade by which particular States might endeavor to
 secure exclusive benefits to their own citizens. The infractions of
 these regulations, on one side, the efforts to prevent and repel
 them, on the other, would naturally lead to outrages, and these to
 reprisals and wars.
The opportunities which some States would have of rendering
 others tributary to them by commercial regulations would be
 impatiently submitted to by the tributary States. The relative
 situation of New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey would afford an
 example of this kind. New York, from the necessities of revenue,
 must lay duties on her importations. A great part of these duties
 must be paid by the inhabitants of the two other States in the
 capacity of consumers of what we import. New York would neither be
 willing nor able to forego this advantage. Her citizens would not
 consent that a duty paid by them should be remitted in favor of the
 citizens of her neighbors; nor would it be practicable, if there
 were not this impediment in the way, to distinguish the customers in
 our own markets. Would Connecticut and New Jersey long submit to be
 taxed by New York for her exclusive benefit? Should we be long
 permitted to remain in the quiet and undisturbed enjoyment of a
 metropolis, from the possession of which we derived an advantage so
 odious to our neighbors, and, in their opinion, so oppressive?
 Should we be able to preserve it against the incumbent weight of
 Connecticut on the one side, and the co-operating pressure of New
 Jersey on the other? These are questions that temerity alone will
 answer in the affirmative.
The public debt of the Union would be a further cause of
 collision between the separate States or confederacies. The
 apportionment, in the first instance, and the progressive
 extinguishment afterward, would be alike productive of ill-humor and
 animosity. How would it be possible to agree upon a rule of
 apportionment satisfactory to all? There is scarcely any that can
 be proposed which is entirely free from real objections. These, as
 usual, would be exaggerated by the adverse interest of the parties.
 There are even dissimilar views among the States as to the general
 principle of discharging the public debt. Some of them, either less
 impressed with the importance of national credit, or because their
 citizens have little, if any, immediate interest in the question,
 feel an indifference, if not a repugnance, to the payment of the
 domestic debt at any rate. These would be inclined to magnify the
 difficulties of a distribution. Others of them, a numerous body of
 whose citizens are creditors to the public beyond proportion of the
 State in the total amount of the national debt, would be strenuous
 for some equitable and effective provision. The procrastinations of
 the former would excite the resentments of the latter. The
 settlement of a rule would, in the meantime, be postponed by real
 differences of opinion and affected delays. The citizens of the
 States interested would clamour; foreign powers would urge for the
 satisfaction of their just demands, and the peace of the States
 would be hazarded to the double contingency of external invasion and
 internal contention.
Suppose the difficulties of agreeing upon a rule surmounted, and
 the apportionment made. Still there is great room to suppose that
 the rule agreed upon would, upon experiment, be found to bear harder
 upon some States than upon others. Those which were sufferers by it
 would naturally seek for a mitigation of the burden. The others
 would as naturally be disinclined to a revision, which was likely to
 end in an increase of their own incumbrances. Their refusal would
 be too plausible a pretext to the complaining States to withhold
 their contributions, not to be embraced with avidity; and the
 non-compliance of these States with their engagements would be a
 ground of bitter discussion and altercation. If even the rule
 adopted should in practice justify the equality of its principle,
 still delinquencies in payments on the part of some of the States
 would result from a diversity of other causes--the real deficiency of
 resources; the mismanagement of their finances; accidental
 disorders in the management of the government; and, in addition to
 the rest, the reluctance with which men commonly part with money for
 purposes that have outlived the exigencies which produced them, and
 interfere with the supply of immediate wants. Delinquencies, from
 whatever causes, would be productive of complaints, recriminations,
 and quarrels. There is, perhaps, nothing more likely to disturb the
 tranquillity of nations than their being bound to mutual
 contributions for any common object that does not yield an equal and
 coincident benefit. For it is an observation, as true as it is
 trite, that there is nothing men differ so readily about as the
 payment of money.
Laws in violation of private contracts, as they amount to
 aggressions on the rights of those States whose citizens are injured
 by them, may be considered as another probable source of hostility.
 We are not authorized to expect that a more liberal or more
 equitable spirit would preside over the legislations of the
 individual States hereafter, if unrestrained by any additional
 checks, than we have heretofore seen in too many instances
 disgracing their several codes. We have observed the disposition to
 retaliation excited in Connecticut in consequence of the enormities
 perpetrated by the Legislature of Rhode Island; and we reasonably
 infer that, in similar cases, under other circumstances, a war, not
 of PARCHMENT, but of the sword, would chastise such atrocious
 breaches of moral obligation and social justice.
The probability of incompatible alliances between the different
 States or confederacies and different foreign nations, and the
 effects of this situation upon the peace of the whole, have been
 sufficiently unfolded in some preceding papers. From the view they
 have exhibited of this part of the subject, this conclusion is to be
 drawn, that America, if not connected at all, or only by the feeble
 tie of a simple league, offensive and defensive, would, by the
 operation of such jarring alliances, be gradually entangled in all
 the pernicious labyrinths of European politics and wars; and by the
 destructive contentions of the parts into which she was divided,
 would be likely to become a prey to the artifices and machinations
 of powers equally the enemies of them all. Divide et
 impera1 must be the motto of every nation that either hates or
 fears us.2 PUBLIUS.

2 In order that the whole subject of these papers may as soon as
 possible be laid before the public, it is proposed to publish them
 four times a week--on Tuesday in the New York Packet and on
 Thursday in the Daily Advertiser.


FEDERALIST No. 8

The Consequences of Hostilities Between the States
From the New York Packet.
Tuesday, November 20, 1787.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
ASSUMING it therefore as an established truth that the several
 States, in case of disunion, or such combinations of them as might
 happen to be formed out of the wreck of the general Confederacy,
 would be subject to those vicissitudes of peace and war, of
 friendship and enmity, with each other, which have fallen to the lot
 of all neighboring nations not united under one government, let us
 enter into a concise detail of some of the consequences that would
 attend such a situation.
War between the States, in the first period of their separate
 existence, would be accompanied with much greater distresses than it
 commonly is in those countries where regular military establishments
 have long obtained. The disciplined armies always kept on foot on
 the continent of Europe, though they bear a malignant aspect to
 liberty and economy, have, notwithstanding, been productive of the
 signal advantage of rendering sudden conquests impracticable, and of
 preventing that rapid desolation which used to mark the progress of
 war prior to their introduction. The art of fortification has
 contributed to the same ends. The nations of Europe are encircled
 with chains of fortified places, which mutually obstruct invasion.
 Campaigns are wasted in reducing two or three frontier garrisons,
 to gain admittance into an enemy's country. Similar impediments
 occur at every step, to exhaust the strength and delay the progress
 of an invader. Formerly, an invading army would penetrate into the
 heart of a neighboring country almost as soon as intelligence of its
 approach could be received; but now a comparatively small force of
 disciplined troops, acting on the defensive, with the aid of posts,
 is able to impede, and finally to frustrate, the enterprises of one
 much more considerable. The history of war, in that quarter of the
 globe, is no longer a history of nations subdued and empires
 overturned, but of towns taken and retaken; of battles that decide
 nothing; of retreats more beneficial than victories; of much
 effort and little acquisition.
In this country the scene would be altogether reversed. The
 jealousy of military establishments would postpone them as long as
 possible. The want of fortifications, leaving the frontiers of one
 state open to another, would facilitate inroads. The populous
 States would, with little difficulty, overrun their less populous
 neighbors. Conquests would be as easy to be made as difficult to be
 retained. War, therefore, would be desultory and predatory.
 PLUNDER and devastation ever march in the train of irregulars. The
 calamities of individuals would make the principal figure in the
 events which would characterize our military exploits.
This picture is not too highly wrought; though, I confess, it
 would not long remain a just one. Safety from external danger is
 the most powerful director of national conduct. Even the ardent
 love of liberty will, after a time, give way to its dictates. The
 violent destruction of life and property incident to war, the
 continual effort and alarm attendant on a state of continual danger,
 will compel nations the most attached to liberty to resort for
 repose and security to institutions which have a tendency to destroy
 their civil and political rights. To be more safe, they at length
 become willing to run the risk of being less free.
The institutions chiefly alluded to are STANDING ARMIES and the
 correspondent appendages of military establishments. Standing
 armies, it is said, are not provided against in the new
 Constitution; and it is therefore inferred that they may exist
 under it.1 Their existence, however, from the very terms of the
 proposition, is, at most, problematical and uncertain. But standing
 armies, it may be replied, must inevitably result from a dissolution
 of the Confederacy. Frequent war and constant apprehension, which
 require a state of as constant preparation, will infallibly produce
 them. The weaker States or confederacies would first have recourse
 to them, to put themselves upon an equality with their more potent
 neighbors. They would endeavor to supply the inferiority of
 population and resources by a more regular and effective system of
 defense, by disciplined troops, and by fortifications. They would,
 at the same time, be necessitated to strengthen the executive arm of
 government, in doing which their constitutions would acquire a
 progressive direction toward monarchy. It is of the nature of war
 to increase the executive at the expense of the legislative
 authority.
The expedients which have been mentioned would soon give the
 States or confederacies that made use of them a superiority over
 their neighbors. Small states, or states of less natural strength,
 under vigorous governments, and with the assistance of disciplined
 armies, have often triumphed over large states, or states of greater
 natural strength, which have been destitute of these advantages.
 Neither the pride nor the safety of the more important States or
 confederacies would permit them long to submit to this mortifying
 and adventitious superiority. They would quickly resort to means
 similar to those by which it had been effected, to reinstate
 themselves in their lost pre-eminence. Thus, we should, in a little
 time, see established in every part of this country the same engines
 of despotism which have been the scourge of the Old World. This, at
 least, would be the natural course of things; and our reasonings
 will be the more likely to be just, in proportion as they are
 accommodated to this standard.
These are not vague inferences drawn from supposed or
 speculative defects in a Constitution, the whole power of which is
 lodged in the hands of a people, or their representatives and
 delegates, but they are solid conclusions, drawn from the natural
 and necessary progress of human affairs.
It may, perhaps, be asked, by way of objection to this, why did
 not standing armies spring up out of the contentions which so often
 distracted the ancient republics of Greece? Different answers,
 equally satisfactory, may be given to this question. The
 industrious habits of the people of the present day, absorbed in the
 pursuits of gain, and devoted to the improvements of agriculture and
 commerce, are incompatible with the condition of a nation of
 soldiers, which was the true condition of the people of those
 republics. The means of revenue, which have been so greatly
 multiplied by the increase of gold and silver and of the arts of
 industry, and the science of finance, which is the offspring of
 modern times, concurring with the habits of nations, have produced
 an entire revolution in the system of war, and have rendered
 disciplined armies, distinct from the body of the citizens, the
 inseparable companions of frequent hostility.
There is a wide difference, also, between military
 establishments in a country seldom exposed by its situation to
 internal invasions, and in one which is often subject to them, and
 always apprehensive of them. The rulers of the former can have a
 good pretext, if they are even so inclined, to keep on foot armies
 so numerous as must of necessity be maintained in the latter. These
 armies being, in the first case, rarely, if at all, called into
 activity for interior defense, the people are in no danger of being
 broken to military subordination. The laws are not accustomed to
 relaxations, in favor of military exigencies; the civil state
 remains in full vigor, neither corrupted, nor confounded with the
 principles or propensities of the other state. The smallness of the
 army renders the natural strength of the community an over-match for
 it; and the citizens, not habituated to look up to the military
 power for protection, or to submit to its oppressions, neither love
 nor fear the soldiery; they view them with a spirit of jealous
 acquiescence in a necessary evil, and stand ready to resist a power
 which they suppose may be exerted to the prejudice of their rights.
 The army under such circumstances may usefully aid the magistrate
 to suppress a small faction, or an occasional mob, or insurrection;
 but it will be unable to enforce encroachments against the united
 efforts of the great body of the people.
In a country in the predicament last described, the contrary of
 all this happens. The perpetual menacings of danger oblige the
 government to be always prepared to repel it; its armies must be
 numerous enough for instant defense. The continual necessity for
 their services enhances the importance of the soldier, and
 proportionably degrades the condition of the citizen. The military
 state becomes elevated above the civil. The inhabitants of
 territories, often the theatre of war, are unavoidably subjected to
 frequent infringements on their rights, which serve to weaken their
 sense of those rights; and by degrees the people are brought to
 consider the soldiery not only as their protectors, but as their
 superiors. The transition from this disposition to that of
 considering them masters, is neither remote nor difficult; but it
 is very difficult to prevail upon a people under such impressions,
 to make a bold or effectual resistance to usurpations supported by
 the military power.
The kingdom of Great Britain falls within the first description.
 An insular situation, and a powerful marine, guarding it in a great
 measure against the possibility of foreign invasion, supersede the
 necessity of a numerous army within the kingdom. A sufficient force
 to make head against a sudden descent, till the militia could have
 time to rally and embody, is all that has been deemed requisite. No
 motive of national policy has demanded, nor would public opinion
 have tolerated, a larger number of troops upon its domestic
 establishment. There has been, for a long time past, little room
 for the operation of the other causes, which have been enumerated as
 the consequences of internal war. This peculiar felicity of
 situation has, in a great degree, contributed to preserve the
 liberty which that country to this day enjoys, in spite of the
 prevalent venality and corruption. If, on the contrary, Britain had
 been situated on the continent, and had been compelled, as she would
 have been, by that situation, to make her military establishments at
 home coextensive with those of the other great powers of Europe,
 she, like them, would in all probability be, at this day, a victim
 to the absolute power of a single man. 'T is possible, though not
 easy, that the people of that island may be enslaved from other
 causes; but it cannot be by the prowess of an army so
 inconsiderable as that which has been usually kept up within the
 kingdom.
If we are wise enough to preserve the Union we may for ages
 enjoy an advantage similar to that of an insulated situation.
 Europe is at a great distance from us. Her colonies in our
 vicinity will be likely to continue too much disproportioned in
 strength to be able to give us any dangerous annoyance. Extensive
 military establishments cannot, in this position, be necessary to
 our security. But if we should be disunited, and the integral parts
 should either remain separated, or, which is most probable, should
 be thrown together into two or three confederacies, we should be, in
 a short course of time, in the predicament of the continental powers
 of Europe --our liberties would be a prey to the means of defending
 ourselves against the ambition and jealousy of each other.
This is an idea not superficial or futile, but solid and weighty. 
 It deserves the most serious and mature consideration of every
 prudent and honest man of whatever party. If such men will make a
 firm and solemn pause, and meditate dispassionately on the
 importance of this interesting idea; if they will contemplate it in
 all its attitudes, and trace it to all its consequences, they will
 not hesitate to part with trivial objections to a Constitution, the
 rejection of which would in all probability put a final period to
 the Union. The airy phantoms that flit before the distempered
 imaginations of some of its adversaries would quickly give place to
 the more substantial forms of dangers, real, certain, and formidable.
PUBLIUS.
1 This objection will be fully examined in its proper place, and
 it will be shown that the only natural precaution which could have
 been taken on this subject has been taken; and a much better one
 than is to be found in any constitution that has been heretofore
 framed in America, most of which contain no guard at all on this
 subject.


FEDERALIST No. 9

The Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic Faction and Insurrection
For the Independent Journal.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
A FIRM Union will be of the utmost moment to the peace and
 liberty of the States, as a barrier against domestic faction and
 insurrection. It is impossible to read the history of the petty
 republics of Greece and Italy without feeling sensations of horror
 and disgust at the distractions with which they were continually
 agitated, and at the rapid succession of revolutions by which they
 were kept in a state of perpetual vibration between the extremes of
 tyranny and anarchy. If they exhibit occasional calms, these only
 serve as short-lived contrast to the furious storms that are to
 succeed. If now and then intervals of felicity open to view, we
 behold them with a mixture of regret, arising from the reflection
 that the pleasing scenes before us are soon to be overwhelmed by the
 tempestuous waves of sedition and party rage. If momentary rays of
 glory break forth from the gloom, while they dazzle us with a
 transient and fleeting brilliancy, they at the same time admonish us
 to lament that the vices of government should pervert the direction
 and tarnish the lustre of those bright talents and exalted
 endowments for which the favored soils that produced them have been
 so justly celebrated.
From the disorders that disfigure the annals of those republics
 the advocates of despotism have drawn arguments, not only against
 the forms of republican government, but against the very principles
 of civil liberty. They have decried all free government as
 inconsistent with the order of society, and have indulged themselves
 in malicious exultation over its friends and partisans. Happily for
 mankind, stupendous fabrics reared on the basis of liberty, which
 have flourished for ages, have, in a few glorious instances, refuted
 their gloomy sophisms. And, I trust, America will be the broad and
 solid foundation of other edifices, not less magnificent, which will
 be equally permanent monuments of their errors.
But it is not to be denied that the portraits they have sketched
 of republican government were too just copies of the originals from
 which they were taken. If it had been found impracticable to have
 devised models of a more perfect structure, the enlightened friends
 to liberty would have been obliged to abandon the cause of that
 species of government as indefensible. The science of politics,
 however, like most other sciences, has received great improvement.
 The efficacy of various principles is now well understood, which
 were either not known at all, or imperfectly known to the ancients.
 The regular distribution of power into distinct departments; the
 introduction of legislative balances and checks; the institution of
 courts composed of judges holding their offices during good
 behavior; the representation of the people in the legislature by
 deputies of their own election: these are wholly new discoveries,
 or have made their principal progress towards perfection in modern
 times. They are means, and powerful means, by which the excellences
 of republican government may be retained and its imperfections
 lessened or avoided. To this catalogue of circumstances that tend
 to the amelioration of popular systems of civil government, I shall
 venture, however novel it may appear to some, to add one more, on a
 principle which has been made the foundation of an objection to the
 new Constitution; I mean the ENLARGEMENT of the ORBIT within which
 such systems are to revolve, either in respect to the dimensions of
 a single State or to the consolidation of several smaller States
 into one great Confederacy. The latter is that which immediately
 concerns the object under consideration. It will, however, be of
 use to examine the principle in its application to a single State,
 which shall be attended to in another place.
The utility of a Confederacy, as well to suppress faction and to
 guard the internal tranquillity of States, as to increase their
 external force and security, is in reality not a new idea. It has
 been practiced upon in different countries and ages, and has
 received the sanction of the most approved writers on the subject of
 politics. The opponents of the plan proposed have, with great
 assiduity, cited and circulated the observations of Montesquieu on
 the necessity of a contracted territory for a republican government.
 But they seem not to have been apprised of the sentiments of that
 great man expressed in another part of his work, nor to have
 adverted to the consequences of the principle to which they
 subscribe with such ready acquiescence.
When Montesquieu recommends a small extent for republics, the
 standards he had in view were of dimensions far short of the limits
 of almost every one of these States. Neither Virginia,
 Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New York, North Carolina, nor Georgia
 can by any means be compared with the models from which he reasoned
 and to which the terms of his description apply. If we therefore
 take his ideas on this point as the criterion of truth, we shall be
 driven to the alternative either of taking refuge at once in the
 arms of monarchy, or of splitting ourselves into an infinity of
 little, jealous, clashing, tumultuous commonwealths, the wretched
 nurseries of unceasing discord, and the miserable objects of
 universal pity or contempt. Some of the writers who have come
 forward on the other side of the question seem to have been aware of
 the dilemma; and have even been bold enough to hint at the division
 of the larger States as a desirable thing. Such an infatuated
 policy, such a desperate expedient, might, by the multiplication of
 petty offices, answer the views of men who possess not
 qualifications to extend their influence beyond the narrow circles
 of personal intrigue, but it could never promote the greatness or
 happiness of the people of America.
Referring the examination of the principle itself to another
 place, as has been already mentioned, it will be sufficient to
 remark here that, in the sense of the author who has been most
 emphatically quoted upon the occasion, it would only dictate a
 reduction of the SIZE of the more considerable MEMBERS of the Union,
 but would not militate against their being all comprehended in one
 confederate government. And this is the true question, in the
 discussion of which we are at present interested.
So far are the suggestions of Montesquieu from standing in
 opposition to a general Union of the States, that he explicitly
 treats of a CONFEDERATE REPUBLIC as the expedient for extending the
 sphere of popular government, and reconciling the advantages of
 monarchy with those of republicanism.
``It is very probable,'' (says he1) ``that mankind would
 have been obliged at length to live constantly under the government
 of a single person, had they not contrived a kind of constitution
 that has all the internal advantages of a republican, together with
 the external force of a monarchical government. I mean a
 CONFEDERATE REPUBLIC.
``This form of government is a convention by which several
 smaller STATES agree to become members of a larger ONE, which they
 intend to form. It is a kind of assemblage of societies that
 constitute a new one, capable of increasing, by means of new
 associations, till they arrive to such a degree of power as to be
 able to provide for the security of the united body.
``A republic of this kind, able to withstand an external force,
 may support itself without any internal corruptions. The form of
 this society prevents all manner of inconveniences.
``If a single member should attempt to usurp the supreme
 authority, he could not be supposed to have an equal authority and
 credit in all the confederate states. Were he to have too great
 influence over one, this would alarm the rest. Were he to subdue a
 part, that which would still remain free might oppose him with
 forces independent of those which he had usurped and overpower him
 before he could be settled in his usurpation.
``Should a popular insurrection happen in one of the confederate
 states the others are able to quell it. Should abuses creep into
 one part, they are reformed by those that remain sound. The state
 may be destroyed on one side, and not on the other; the confederacy
 may be dissolved, and the confederates preserve their sovereignty.
``As this government is composed of small republics, it enjoys
 the internal happiness of each; and with respect to its external
 situation, it is possessed, by means of the association, of all the
 advantages of large monarchies.''
I have thought it proper to quote at length these interesting
 passages, because they contain a luminous abridgment of the
 principal arguments in favor of the Union, and must effectually
 remove the false impressions which a misapplication of other parts
 of the work was calculated to make. They have, at the same time, an
 intimate connection with the more immediate design of this paper;
 which is, to illustrate the tendency of the Union to repress
 domestic faction and insurrection.
A distinction, more subtle than accurate, has been raised
 between a CONFEDERACY and a CONSOLIDATION of the States. The
 essential characteristic of the first is said to be, the restriction
 of its authority to the members in their collective capacities,
 without reaching to the individuals of whom they are composed. It
 is contended that the national council ought to have no concern with
 any object of internal administration. An exact equality of
 suffrage between the members has also been insisted upon as a
 leading feature of a confederate government. These positions are,
 in the main, arbitrary; they are supported neither by principle nor
 precedent. It has indeed happened, that governments of this kind
 have generally operated in the manner which the distinction taken
 notice of, supposes to be inherent in their nature; but there have
 been in most of them extensive exceptions to the practice, which
 serve to prove, as far as example will go, that there is no absolute
 rule on the subject. And it will be clearly shown in the course of
 this investigation that as far as the principle contended for has
 prevailed, it has been the cause of incurable disorder and
 imbecility in the government.
The definition of a CONFEDERATE REPUBLIC seems simply to be ``an
 assemblage of societies,'' or an association of two or more states
 into one state. The extent, modifications, and objects of the
 federal authority are mere matters of discretion. So long as the
 separate organization of the members be not abolished; so long as
 it exists, by a constitutional necessity, for local purposes;
 though it should be in perfect subordination to the general
 authority of the union, it would still be, in fact and in theory, an
 association of states, or a confederacy. The proposed Constitution,
 so far from implying an abolition of the State governments, makes
 them constituent parts of the national sovereignty, by allowing them
 a direct representation in the Senate, and leaves in their
 possession certain exclusive and very important portions of
 sovereign power. This fully corresponds, in every rational import
 of the terms, with the idea of a federal government.
In the Lycian confederacy, which consisted of twenty-three
 CITIES or republics, the largest were entitled to THREE votes in the
 COMMON COUNCIL, those of the middle class to TWO, and the smallest
 to ONE. The COMMON COUNCIL had the appointment of all the judges
 and magistrates of the respective CITIES. This was certainly the
 most, delicate species of interference in their internal
 administration; for if there be any thing that seems exclusively
 appropriated to the local jurisdictions, it is the appointment of
 their own officers. Yet Montesquieu, speaking of this association,
 says: ``Were I to give a model of an excellent Confederate
 Republic, it would be that of Lycia.'' Thus we perceive that the
 distinctions insisted upon were not within the contemplation of this
 enlightened civilian; and we shall be led to conclude, that they
 are the novel refinements of an erroneous theory.

The Same Subject Continued
(The Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic Faction and
 Insurrection)
From the New York Packet.
Friday, November 23, 1787.

MADISON

To the People of the State of New York:
AMONG the numerous advantages promised by a wellconstructed
 Union, none deserves to be more accurately developed than its
 tendency to break and control the violence of faction. The friend
 of popular governments never finds himself so much alarmed for their
 character and fate, as when he contemplates their propensity to this
 dangerous vice. He will not fail, therefore, to set a due value on
 any plan which, without violating the principles to which he is
 attached, provides a proper cure for it. The instability,
 injustice, and confusion introduced into the public councils, have,
 in truth, been the mortal diseases under which popular governments
 have everywhere perished; as they continue to be the favorite and
 fruitful topics from which the adversaries to liberty derive their
 most specious declamations. The valuable improvements made by the
 American constitutions on the popular models, both ancient and
 modern, cannot certainly be too much admired; but it would be an
 unwarrantable partiality, to contend that they have as effectually
 obviated the danger on this side, as was wished and expected.
 Complaints are everywhere heard from our most considerate and
 virtuous citizens, equally the friends of public and private faith,
 and of public and personal liberty, that our governments are too
 unstable, that the public good is disregarded in the conflicts of
 rival parties, and that measures are too often decided, not
 according to the rules of justice and the rights of the minor party,
 but by the superior force of an interested and overbearing majority.
 However anxiously we may wish that these complaints had no
 foundation, the evidence, of known facts will not permit us to deny
 that they are in some degree true. It will be found, indeed, on a
 candid review of our situation, that some of the distresses under
 which we labor have been erroneously charged on the operation of our
 governments; but it will be found, at the same time, that other
 causes will not alone account for many of our heaviest misfortunes;
 and, particularly, for that prevailing and increasing distrust of
 public engagements, and alarm for private rights, which are echoed
 from one end of the continent to the other. These must be chiefly,
 if not wholly, effects of the unsteadiness and injustice with which
 a factious spirit has tainted our public administrations.
By a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether
 amounting to a majority or a minority of the whole, who are united
 and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest,
 adversed to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and
 aggregate interests of the community.
There are two methods of curing the mischiefs of faction: the
 one, by removing its causes; the other, by controlling its effects.
There are again two methods of removing the causes of faction:
 the one, by destroying the liberty which is essential to its
 existence; the other, by giving to every citizen the same opinions,
 the same passions, and the same interests.
It could never be more truly said than of the first remedy, that
 it was worse than the disease. Liberty is to faction what air is to
 fire, an aliment without which it instantly expires. But it could
 not be less folly to abolish liberty, which is essential to
 political life, because it nourishes faction, than it would be to
 wish the annihilation of air, which is essential to animal life,
 because it imparts to fire its destructive agency.
The second expedient is as impracticable as the first would be
 unwise. As long as the reason of man continues fallible, and he is
 at liberty to exercise it, different opinions will be formed. As
 long as the connection subsists between his reason and his
 self-love, his opinions and his passions will have a reciprocal
 influence on each other; and the former will be objects to which
 the latter will attach themselves. The diversity in the faculties
 of men, from which the rights of property originate, is not less an
 insuperable obstacle to a uniformity of interests. The protection
 of these faculties is the first object of government. From the
 protection of different and unequal faculties of acquiring property,
 the possession of different degrees and kinds of property
 immediately results; and from the influence of these on the
 sentiments and views of the respective proprietors, ensues a
 division of the society into different interests and parties.
The latent causes of faction are thus sown in the nature of man;
 and we see them everywhere brought into different degrees of
 activity, according to the different circumstances of civil society.
 A zeal for different opinions concerning religion, concerning
 government, and many other points, as well of speculation as of
 practice; an attachment to different leaders ambitiously contending
 for pre-eminence and power; or to persons of other descriptions
 whose fortunes have been interesting to the human passions, have, in
 turn, divided mankind into parties, inflamed them with mutual
 animosity, and rendered them much more disposed to vex and oppress
 each other than to co-operate for their common good. So strong is
 this propensity of mankind to fall into mutual animosities, that
 where no substantial occasion presents itself, the most frivolous
 and fanciful distinctions have been sufficient to kindle their
 unfriendly passions and excite their most violent conflicts. But
 the most common and durable source of factions has been the various
 and unequal distribution of property. Those who hold and those who
 are without property have ever formed distinct interests in society.
 Those who are creditors, and those who are debtors, fall under a
 like discrimination. A landed interest, a manufacturing interest, a
 mercantile interest, a moneyed interest, with many lesser interests,
 grow up of necessity in civilized nations, and divide them into
 different classes, actuated by different sentiments and views. The
 regulation of these various and interfering interests forms the
 principal task of modern legislation, and involves the spirit of
 party and faction in the necessary and ordinary operations of the
 government.
No man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause, because his
 interest would certainly bias his judgment, and, not improbably,
 corrupt his integrity. With equal, nay with greater reason, a body
 of men are unfit to be both judges and parties at the same time;
 yet what are many of the most important acts of legislation, but so
 many judicial determinations, not indeed concerning the rights of
 single persons, but concerning the rights of large bodies of
 citizens? And what are the different classes of legislators but
 advocates and parties to the causes which they determine? Is a law
 proposed concerning private debts? It is a question to which the
 creditors are parties on one side and the debtors on the other.
 Justice ought to hold the balance between them. Yet the parties
 are, and must be, themselves the judges; and the most numerous
 party, or, in other words, the most powerful faction must be
 expected to prevail. Shall domestic manufactures be encouraged, and
 in what degree, by restrictions on foreign manufactures? are
 questions which would be differently decided by the landed and the
 manufacturing classes, and probably by neither with a sole regard to
 justice and the public good. The apportionment of taxes on the
 various descriptions of property is an act which seems to require
 the most exact impartiality; yet there is, perhaps, no legislative
 act in which greater opportunity and temptation are given to a
 predominant party to trample on the rules of justice. Every
 shilling with which they overburden the inferior number, is a
 shilling saved to their own pockets.
It is in vain to say that enlightened statesmen will be able to
 adjust these clashing interests, and render them all subservient to
 the public good. Enlightened statesmen will not always be at the
 helm. Nor, in many cases, can such an adjustment be made at all
 without taking into view indirect and remote considerations, which
 will rarely prevail over the immediate interest which one party may
 find in disregarding the rights of another or the good of the whole.
The inference to which we are brought is, that the CAUSES of
 faction cannot be removed, and that relief is only to be sought in
 the means of controlling its EFFECTS.
If a faction consists of less than a majority, relief is
 supplied by the republican principle, which enables the majority to
 defeat its sinister views by regular vote. It may clog the
 administration, it may convulse the society; but it will be unable
 to execute and mask its violence under the forms of the Constitution. 
 When a majority is included in a faction, the form of popular
 government, on the other hand, enables it to sacrifice to its ruling
 passion or interest both the public good and the rights of other
 citizens. To secure the public good and private rights against the
 danger of such a faction, and at the same time to preserve the
 spirit and the form of popular government, is then the great object
 to which our inquiries are directed. Let me add that it is the
 great desideratum by which this form of government can be rescued
 from the opprobrium under which it has so long labored, and be
 recommended to the esteem and adoption of mankind.
By what means is this object attainable? Evidently by one of
 two only. Either the existence of the same passion or interest in a
 majority at the same time must be prevented, or the majority, having
 such coexistent passion or interest, must be rendered, by their
 number and local situation, unable to concert and carry into effect
 schemes of oppression. If the impulse and the opportunity be
 suffered to coincide, we well know that neither moral nor religious
 motives can be relied on as an adequate control. They are not found
 to be such on the injustice and violence of individuals, and lose
 their efficacy in proportion to the number combined together, that
 is, in proportion as their efficacy becomes needful.
From this view of the subject it may be concluded that a pure
 democracy, by which I mean a society consisting of a small number of
 citizens, who assemble and administer the government in person, can
 admit of no cure for the mischiefs of faction. A common passion or
 interest will, in almost every case, be felt by a majority of the
 whole; a communication and concert result from the form of
 government itself; and there is nothing to check the inducements to
 sacrifice the weaker party or an obnoxious individual. Hence it is
 that such democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and
 contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal
 security or the rights of property; and have in general been as
 short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths.
 Theoretic politicians, who have patronized this species of
 government, have erroneously supposed that by reducing mankind to a
 perfect equality in their political rights, they would, at the same
 time, be perfectly equalized and assimilated in their possessions,
 their opinions, and their passions.
A republic, by which I mean a government in which the scheme of
 representation takes place, opens a different prospect, and promises
 the cure for which we are seeking. Let us examine the points in
 which it varies from pure democracy, and we shall comprehend both
 the nature of the cure and the efficacy which it must derive from
 the Union.
The two great points of difference between a democracy and a
 republic are: first, the delegation of the government, in the
 latter, to a small number of citizens elected by the rest;
 secondly, the greater number of citizens, and greater sphere of
 country, over which the latter may be extended.
The effect of the first difference is, on the one hand, to
 refine and enlarge the public views, by passing them through the
 medium of a chosen body of citizens, whose wisdom may best discern
 the true interest of their country, and whose patriotism and love of
 justice will be least likely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial
 considerations. Under such a regulation, it may well happen that
 the public voice, pronounced by the representatives of the people,
 will be more consonant to the public good than if pronounced by the
 people themselves, convened for the purpose. On the other hand, the
 effect may be inverted. Men of factious tempers, of local
 prejudices, or of sinister designs, may, by intrigue, by corruption,
 or by other means, first obtain the suffrages, and then betray the
 interests, of the people. The question resulting is, whether small
 or extensive republics are more favorable to the election of proper
 guardians of the public weal; and it is clearly decided in favor of
 the latter by two obvious considerations:
In the first place, it is to be remarked that, however small the
 republic may be, the representatives must be raised to a certain
 number, in order to guard against the cabals of a few; and that,
 however large it may be, they must be limited to a certain number,
 in order to guard against the confusion of a multitude. Hence, the
 number of representatives in the two cases not being in proportion
 to that of the two constituents, and being proportionally greater in
 the small republic, it follows that, if the proportion of fit
 characters be not less in the large than in the small republic, the
 former will present a greater option, and consequently a greater
 probability of a fit choice.
In the next place, as each representative will be chosen by a
 greater number of citizens in the large than in the small republic,
 it will be more difficult for unworthy candidates to practice with
 success the vicious arts by which elections are too often carried;
 and the suffrages of the people being more free, will be more
 likely to centre in men who possess the most attractive merit and
 the most diffusive and established characters.
It must be confessed that in this, as in most other cases, there
 is a mean, on both sides of which inconveniences will be found to
 lie. By enlarging too much the number of electors, you render the
 representatives too little acquainted with all their local
 circumstances and lesser interests; as by reducing it too much, you
 render him unduly attached to these, and too little fit to
 comprehend and pursue great and national objects. The federal
 Constitution forms a happy combination in this respect; the great
 and aggregate interests being referred to the national, the local
 and particular to the State legislatures.
The other point of difference is, the greater number of citizens
 and extent of territory which may be brought within the compass of
 republican than of democratic government; and it is this
 circumstance principally which renders factious combinations less to
 be dreaded in the former than in the latter. The smaller the
 society, the fewer probably will be the distinct parties and
 interests composing it; the fewer the distinct parties and
 interests, the more frequently will a majority be found of the same
 party; and the smaller the number of individuals composing a
 majority, and the smaller the compass within which they are placed,
 the more easily will they concert and execute their plans of
 oppression. Extend the sphere, and you take in a greater variety of
 parties and interests; you make it less probable that a majority of
 the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other
 citizens; or if such a common motive exists, it will be more
 difficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength, and to
 act in unison with each other. Besides other impediments, it may be
 remarked that, where there is a consciousness of unjust or
 dishonorable purposes, communication is always checked by distrust
 in proportion to the number whose concurrence is necessary.
Hence, it clearly appears, that the same advantage which a
 republic has over a democracy, in controlling the effects of
 faction, is enjoyed by a large over a small republic,--is enjoyed by
 the Union over the States composing it. Does the advantage consist
 in the substitution of representatives whose enlightened views and
 virtuous sentiments render them superior to local prejudices and
 schemes of injustice? It will not be denied that the representation
 of the Union will be most likely to possess these requisite
 endowments. Does it consist in the greater security afforded by a
 greater variety of parties, against the event of any one party being
 able to outnumber and oppress the rest? In an equal degree does the
 increased variety of parties comprised within the Union, increase
 this security. Does it, in fine, consist in the greater obstacles
 opposed to the concert and accomplishment of the secret wishes of an
 unjust and interested majority? Here, again, the extent of the
 Union gives it the most palpable advantage.
The influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame within
 their particular States, but will be unable to spread a general
 conflagration through the other States. A religious sect may
 degenerate into a political faction in a part of the Confederacy;
 but the variety of sects dispersed over the entire face of it must
 secure the national councils against any danger from that source. A
 rage for paper money, for an abolition of debts, for an equal
 division of property, or for any other improper or wicked project,
 will be less apt to pervade the whole body of the Union than a
 particular member of it; in the same proportion as such a malady is
 more likely to taint a particular county or district, than an entire
 State.
In the extent and proper structure of the Union, therefore, we
 behold a republican remedy for the diseases most incident to
 republican government. And according to the degree of pleasure and
 pride we feel in being republicans, ought to be our zeal in
 cherishing the spirit and supporting the character of Federalists.

FEDERALIST No. 11

The Utility of the Union in Respect to Commercial Relations and a
 Navy
For the Independent Journal.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
THE importance of the Union, in a commercial light, is one of
 those points about which there is least room to entertain a
 difference of opinion, and which has, in fact, commanded the most
 general assent of men who have any acquaintance with the subject.
 This applies as well to our intercourse with foreign countries as
 with each other.
There are appearances to authorize a supposition that the
 adventurous spirit, which distinguishes the commercial character of
 America, has already excited uneasy sensations in several of the
 maritime powers of Europe. They seem to be apprehensive of our too
 great interference in that carrying trade, which is the support of
 their navigation and the foundation of their naval strength. Those
 of them which have colonies in America look forward to what this
 country is capable of becoming, with painful solicitude. They
 foresee the dangers that may threaten their American dominions from
 the neighborhood of States, which have all the dispositions, and
 would possess all the means, requisite to the creation of a powerful
 marine. Impressions of this kind will naturally indicate the policy
 of fostering divisions among us, and of depriving us, as far as
 possible, of an ACTIVE COMMERCE in our own bottoms. This would
 answer the threefold purpose of preventing our interference in their
 navigation, of monopolizing the profits of our trade, and of
 clipping the wings by which we might soar to a dangerous greatness.
 Did not prudence forbid the detail, it would not be difficult to
 trace, by facts, the workings of this policy to the cabinets of
 ministers.
If we continue united, we may counteract a policy so unfriendly
 to our prosperity in a variety of ways. By prohibitory regulations,
 extending, at the same time, throughout the States, we may oblige
 foreign countries to bid against each other, for the privileges of
 our markets. This assertion will not appear chimerical to those who
 are able to appreciate the importance of the markets of three
 millions of people--increasing in rapid progression, for the most
 part exclusively addicted to agriculture, and likely from local
 circumstances to remain so--to any manufacturing nation; and the
 immense difference there would be to the trade and navigation of
 such a nation, between a direct communication in its own ships, and
 an indirect conveyance of its products and returns, to and from
 America, in the ships of another country. Suppose, for instance, we
 had a government in America, capable of excluding Great Britain
 (with whom we have at present no treaty of commerce) from all our
 ports; what would be the probable operation of this step upon her
 politics? Would it not enable us to negotiate, with the fairest
 prospect of success, for commercial privileges of the most valuable
 and extensive kind, in the dominions of that kingdom? When these
 questions have been asked, upon other occasions, they have received
 a plausible, but not a solid or satisfactory answer. It has been
 said that prohibitions on our part would produce no change in the
 system of Britain, because she could prosecute her trade with us
 through the medium of the Dutch, who would be her immediate
 customers and paymasters for those articles which were wanted for
 the supply of our markets. But would not her navigation be
 materially injured by the loss of the important advantage of being
 her own carrier in that trade? Would not the principal part of its
 profits be intercepted by the Dutch, as a compensation for their
 agency and risk? Would not the mere circumstance of freight
 occasion a considerable deduction? Would not so circuitous an
 intercourse facilitate the competitions of other nations, by
 enhancing the price of British commodities in our markets, and by
 transferring to other hands the management of this interesting
 branch of the British commerce?
A mature consideration of the objects suggested by these
 questions will justify a belief that the real disadvantages to
 Britain from such a state of things, conspiring with the
 pre-possessions of a great part of the nation in favor of the
 American trade, and with the importunities of the West India
 islands, would produce a relaxation in her present system, and would
 let us into the enjoyment of privileges in the markets of those
 islands elsewhere, from which our trade would derive the most
 substantial benefits. Such a point gained from the British
 government, and which could not be expected without an equivalent in
 exemptions and immunities in our markets, would be likely to have a
 correspondent effect on the conduct of other nations, who would not
 be inclined to see themselves altogether supplanted in our trade.
A further resource for influencing the conduct of European
 nations toward us, in this respect, would arise from the
 establishment of a federal navy. There can be no doubt that the
 continuance of the Union under an efficient government would put it
 in our power, at a period not very distant, to create a navy which,
 if it could not vie with those of the great maritime powers, would
 at least be of respectable weight if thrown into the scale of either
 of two contending parties. This would be more peculiarly the case
 in relation to operations in the West Indies. A few ships of the
 line, sent opportunely to the reinforcement of either side, would
 often be sufficient to decide the fate of a campaign, on the event
 of which interests of the greatest magnitude were suspended. Our
 position is, in this respect, a most commanding one. And if to this
 consideration we add that of the usefulness of supplies from this
 country, in the prosecution of military operations in the West
 Indies, it will readily be perceived that a situation so favorable
 would enable us to bargain with great advantage for commercial
 privileges. A price would be set not only upon our friendship, but
 upon our neutrality. By a steady adherence to the Union we may
 hope, erelong, to become the arbiter of Europe in America, and to be
 able to incline the balance of European competitions in this part of
 the world as our interest may dictate.
But in the reverse of this eligible situation, we shall discover
 that the rivalships of the parts would make them checks upon each
 other, and would frustrate all the tempting advantages which nature
 has kindly placed within our reach. In a state so insignificant our
 commerce would be a prey to the wanton intermeddlings of all nations
 at war with each other; who, having nothing to fear from us, would
 with little scruple or remorse, supply their wants by depredations
 on our property as often as it fell in their way. The rights of
 neutrality will only be respected when they are defended by an
 adequate power. A nation, despicable by its weakness, forfeits even
 the privilege of being neutral.
Under a vigorous national government, the natural strength and
 resources of the country, directed to a common interest, would
 baffle all the combinations of European jealousy to restrain our
 growth. This situation would even take away the motive to such
 combinations, by inducing an impracticability of success. An active
 commerce, an extensive navigation, and a flourishing marine would
 then be the offspring of moral and physical necessity. We might
 defy the little arts of the little politicians to control or vary
 the irresistible and unchangeable course of nature.
But in a state of disunion, these combinations might exist and
 might operate with success. It would be in the power of the
 maritime nations, availing themselves of our universal impotence, to
 prescribe the conditions of our political existence; and as they
 have a common interest in being our carriers, and still more in
 preventing our becoming theirs, they would in all probability
 combine to embarrass our navigation in such a manner as would in
 effect destroy it, and confine us to a PASSIVE COMMERCE. We should
 then be compelled to content ourselves with the first price of our
 commodities, and to see the profits of our trade snatched from us to
 enrich our enemies and p rsecutors. That unequaled spirit of
 enterprise, which signalizes the genius of the American merchants
 and navigators, and which is in itself an inexhaustible mine of
 national wealth, would be stifled and lost, and poverty and disgrace
 would overspread a country which, with wisdom, might make herself
 the admiration and envy of the world.
There are rights of great moment to the trade of America which
 are rights of the Union--I allude to the fisheries, to the navigation
 of the Western lakes, and to that of the Mississippi. The
 dissolution of the Confederacy would give room for delicate
 questions concerning the future existence of these rights; which
 the interest of more powerful partners would hardly fail to solve to
 our disadvantage. The disposition of Spain with regard to the
 Mississippi needs no comment. France and Britain are concerned with
 us in the fisheries, and view them as of the utmost moment to their
 navigation. They, of course, would hardly remain long indifferent
 to that decided mastery, of which experience has shown us to be
 possessed in this valuable branch of traffic, and by which we are
 able to undersell those nations in their own markets. What more
 natural than that they should be disposed to exclude from the lists
 such dangerous competitors?
This branch of trade ought not to be considered as a partial
 benefit. All the navigating States may, in different degrees,
 advantageously participate in it, and under circumstances of a
 greater extension of mercantile capital, would not be unlikely to do
 it. As a nursery of seamen, it now is, or when time shall have more
 nearly assimilated the principles of navigation in the several
 States, will become, a universal resource. To the establishment of
 a navy, it must be indispensable.
To this great national object, a NAVY, union will contribute in
 various ways. Every institution will grow and flourish in
 proportion to the quantity and extent of the means concentred
 towards its formation and support. A navy of the United States, as
 it would embrace the resources of all, is an object far less remote
 than a navy of any single State or partial confederacy, which would
 only embrace the resources of a single part. It happens, indeed,
 that different portions of confederated America possess each some
 peculiar advantage for this essential establishment. The more
 southern States furnish in greater abundance certain kinds of naval
 stores--tar, pitch, and turpentine. Their wood for the construction
 of ships is also of a more solid and lasting texture. The
 difference in the duration of the ships of which the navy might be
 composed, if chiefly constructed of Southern wood, would be of
 signal importance, either in the view of naval strength or of
 national economy. Some of the Southern and of the Middle States
 yield a greater plenty of iron, and of better quality. Seamen must
 chiefly be drawn from the Northern hive. The necessity of naval
 protection to external or maritime commerce does not require a
 particular elucidation, no more than the conduciveness of that
 species of commerce to the prosperity of a navy.
An unrestrained intercourse between the States themselves will
 advance the trade of each by an interchange of their respective
 productions, not only for the supply of reciprocal wants at home,
 but for exportation to foreign markets. The veins of commerce in
 every part will be replenished, and will acquire additional motion
 and vigor from a free circulation of the commodities of every part.
 Commercial enterprise will have much greater scope, from the
 diversity in the productions of different States. When the staple
 of one fails from a bad harvest or unproductive crop, it can call to
 its aid the staple of another. The variety, not less than the
 value, of products for exportation contributes to the activity of
 foreign commerce. It can be conducted upon much better terms with a
 large number of materials of a given value than with a small number
 of materials of the same value; arising from the competitions of
 trade and from the fluctations of markets. Particular articles may
 be in great demand at certain periods, and unsalable at others; but
 if there be a variety of articles, it can scarcely happen that they
 should all be at one time in the latter predicament, and on this
 account the operations of the merchant would be less liable to any
 considerable obstruction or stagnation. The speculative trader will
 at once perceive the force of these observations, and will
 acknowledge that the aggregate balance of the commerce of the United
 States would bid fair to be much more favorable than that of the
 thirteen States without union or with partial unions.
It may perhaps be replied to this, that whether the States are
 united or disunited, there would still be an intimate intercourse
 between them which would answer the same ends; this intercourse
 would be fettered, interrupted, and narrowed by a multiplicity of
 causes, which in the course of these papers have been amply detailed. 
 A unity of commercial, as well as political, interests, can only
 result from a unity of government.
There are other points of view in which this subject might be
 placed, of a striking and animating kind. But they would lead us
 too far into the regions of futurity, and would involve topics not
 proper for a newspaper discussion. I shall briefly observe, that
 our situation invites and our interests prompt us to aim at an
 ascendant in the system of American affairs. The world may
 politically, as well as geographically, be divided into four parts,
 each having a distinct set of interests. Unhappily for the other
 three, Europe, by her arms and by her negotiations, by force and by
 fraud, has, in different degrees, extended her dominion over them
 all. Africa, Asia, and America, have successively felt her
 domination. The superiority she has long maintained has tempted her
 to plume herself as the Mistress of the World, and to consider the
 rest of mankind as created for her benefit. Men admired as profound
 philosophers have, in direct terms, attributed to her inhabitants a
 physical superiority, and have gravely asserted that all animals,
 and with them the human species, degenerate in America--that even
 dogs cease to bark after having breathed awhile in our
 atmosphere.1 Facts have too long supported these arrogant
 pretensions of the Europeans. It belongs to us to vindicate the
 honor of the human race, and to teach that assuming brother,
 moderation. Union will enable us to do it. Disunion will will add
 another victim to his triumphs. Let Americans disdain to be the
 instruments of European greatness! Let the thirteen States, bound
 together in a strict and indissoluble Union, concur in erecting one
 great American system, superior to the control of all transatlantic
 force or influence, and able to dictate the terms of the connection
 between the old and the new world!

The Utility of the Union In Respect to Revenue
From the New York Packet.
Tuesday, November 27, 1787.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
THE effects of Union upon the commercial prosperity of the
 States have been sufficiently delineated. Its tendency to promote
 the interests of revenue will be the subject of our present inquiry.
The prosperity of commerce is now perceived and acknowledged by
 all enlightened statesmen to be the most useful as well as the most
 productive source of national wealth, and has accordingly become a
 primary object of their political cares. By multipying the means of
 gratification, by promoting the introduction and circulation of the
 precious metals, those darling objects of human avarice and
 enterprise, it serves to vivify and invigorate the channels of
 industry, and to make them flow with greater activity and
 copiousness. The assiduous merchant, the laborious husbandman, the
 active mechanic, and the industrious manufacturer,--all orders of
 men, look forward with eager expectation and growing alacrity to
 this pleasing reward of their toils. The often-agitated question
 between agriculture and commerce has, from indubitable experience,
 received a decision which has silenced the rivalship that once
 subsisted between them, and has proved, to the satisfaction of their
 friends, that their interests are intimately blended and interwoven.
 It has been found in various countries that, in proportion as
 commerce has flourished, land has risen in value. And how could it
 have happened otherwise? Could that which procures a freer vent for
 the products of the earth, which furnishes new incitements to the
 cultivation of land, which is the most powerful instrument in
 increasing the quantity of money in a state--could that, in fine,
 which is the faithful handmaid of labor and industry, in every
 shape, fail to augment that article, which is the prolific parent of
 far the greatest part of the objects upon which they are exerted?
 It is astonishing that so simple a truth should ever have had an
 adversary; and it is one, among a multitude of proofs, how apt a
 spirit of ill-informed jealousy, or of too great abstraction and
 refinement, is to lead men astray from the plainest truths of reason
 and conviction.
The ability of a country to pay taxes must always be
 proportioned, in a great degree, to the quantity of money in
 circulation, and to the celerity with which it circulates.
 Commerce, contributing to both these objects, must of necessity
 render the payment of taxes easier, and facilitate the requisite
 supplies to the treasury. The hereditary dominions of the Emperor
 of Germany contain a great extent of fertile, cultivated, and
 populous territory, a large proportion of which is situated in mild
 and luxuriant climates. In some parts of this territory are to be
 found the best gold and silver mines in Europe. And yet, from the
 want of the fostering influence of commerce, that monarch can boast
 but slender revenues. He has several times been compelled to owe
 obligations to the pecuniary succors of other nations for the
 preservation of his essential interests, and is unable, upon the
 strength of his own resources, to sustain a long or continued war.
But it is not in this aspect of the subject alone that Union
 will be seen to conduce to the purpose of revenue. There are other
 points of view, in which its influence will appear more immediate
 and decisive. It is evident from the state of the country, from the
 habits of the people, from the experience we have had on the point
 itself, that it is impracticable to raise any very considerable sums
 by direct taxation. Tax laws have in vain been multiplied; new
 methods to enforce the collection have in vain been tried; the
 public expectation has been uniformly disappointed, and the
 treasuries of the States have remained empty. The popular system of
 administration inherent in the nature of popular government,
 coinciding with the real scarcity of money incident to a languid and
 mutilated state of trade, has hitherto defeated every experiment for
 extensive collections, and has at length taught the different
 legislatures the folly of attempting them.
No person acquainted with what happens in other countries will
 be surprised at this circumstance. In so opulent a nation as that
 of Britain, where direct taxes from superior wealth must be much
 more tolerable, and, from the vigor of the government, much more
 practicable, than in America, far the greatest part of the national
 revenue is derived from taxes of the indirect kind, from imposts,
 and from excises. Duties on imported articles form a large branch
 of this latter description.
In America, it is evident that we must a long time depend for
 the means of revenue chiefly on such duties. In most parts of it,
 excises must be confined within a narrow compass. The genius of the
 people will ill brook the inquisitive and peremptory spirit of
 excise laws. The pockets of the farmers, on the other hand, will
 reluctantly yield but scanty supplies, in the unwelcome shape of
 impositions on their houses and lands; and personal property is too
 precarious and invisible a fund to be laid hold of in any other way
 than by the inperceptible agency of taxes on consumption.
If these remarks have any foundation, that state of things which
 will best enable us to improve and extend so valuable a resource
 must be best adapted to our political welfare. And it cannot admit
 of a serious doubt, that this state of things must rest on the basis
 of a general Union. As far as this would be conducive to the
 interests of commerce, so far it must tend to the extension of the
 revenue to be drawn from that source. As far as it would contribute
 to rendering regulations for the collection of the duties more
 simple and efficacious, so far it must serve to answer the purposes
 of making the same rate of duties more productive, and of putting it
 into the power of the government to increase the rate without
 prejudice to trade.
The relative situation of these States; the number of rivers
 with which they are intersected, and of bays that wash there shores;
 the facility of communication in every direction; the affinity of
 language and manners; the familiar habits of intercourse; --all
 these are circumstances that would conspire to render an illicit
 trade between them a matter of little difficulty, and would insure
 frequent evasions of the commercial regulations of each other. The
 separate States or confederacies would be necessitated by mutual
 jealousy to avoid the temptations to that kind of trade by the
 lowness of their duties. The temper of our governments, for a long
 time to come, would not permit those rigorous precautions by which
 the European nations guard the avenues into their respective
 countries, as well by land as by water; and which, even there, are
 found insufficient obstacles to the adventurous stratagems of
 avarice.
In France, there is an army of patrols (as they are called)
 constantly employed to secure their fiscal regulations against the
 inroads of the dealers in contraband trade. Mr. Neckar computes the
 number of these patrols at upwards of twenty thousand. This shows
 the immense difficulty in preventing that species of traffic, where
 there is an inland communication, and places in a strong light the
 disadvantages with which the collection of duties in this country
 would be encumbered, if by disunion the States should be placed in a
 situation, with respect to each other, resembling that of France
 with respect to her neighbors. The arbitrary and vexatious powers
 with which the patrols are necessarily armed, would be intolerable
 in a free country.
If, on the contrary, there be but one government pervading all
 the States, there will be, as to the principal part of our commerce,
 but ONE SIDE to guard--the ATLANTIC COAST. Vessels arriving directly
 from foreign countries, laden with valuable cargoes, would rarely
 choose to hazard themselves to the complicated and critical perils
 which would attend attempts to unlade prior to their coming into
 port. They would have to dread both the dangers of the coast, and
 of detection, as well after as before their arrival at the places of
 their final destination. An ordinary degree of vigilance would be
 competent to the prevention of any material infractions upon the
 rights of the revenue. A few armed vessels, judiciously stationed
 at the entrances of our ports, might at a small expense be made
 useful sentinels of the laws. And the government having the same
 interest to provide against violations everywhere, the co-operation
 of its measures in each State would have a powerful tendency to
 render them effectual. Here also we should preserve by Union, an
 advantage which nature holds out to us, and which would be
 relinquished by separation. The United States lie at a great
 distance from Europe, and at a considerable distance from all other
 places with which they would have extensive connections of foreign
 trade. The passage from them to us, in a few hours, or in a single
 night, as between the coasts of France and Britain, and of other
 neighboring nations, would be impracticable. This is a prodigious
 security against a direct contraband with foreign countries; but a
 circuitous contraband to one State, through the medium of another,
 would be both easy and safe. The difference between a direct
 importation from abroad, and an indirect importation through the
 channel of a neighboring State, in small parcels, according to time
 and opportunity, with the additional facilities of inland
 communication, must be palpable to every man of discernment.
It is therefore evident, that one national government would be
 able, at much less expense, to extend the duties on imports, beyond
 comparison, further than would be practicable to the States
 separately, or to any partial confederacies. Hitherto, I believe,
 it may safely be asserted, that these duties have not upon an
 average exceeded in any State three per cent. In France they are
 estimated to be about fifteen per cent., and in Britain they exceed
 this proportion.1 There seems to be nothing to hinder their
 being increased in this country to at least treble their present
 amount. The single article of ardent spirits, under federal
 regulation, might be made to furnish a considerable revenue. Upon a
 ratio to the importation into this State, the whole quantity
 imported into the United States may be estimated at four millions of
 gallons; which, at a shilling per gallon, would produce two hundred
 thousand pounds. That article would well bear this rate of duty;
 and if it should tend to diminish the consumption of it, such an
 effect would be equally favorable to the agriculture, to the
 economy, to the morals, and to the health of the society. There is,
 perhaps, nothing so much a subject of national extravagance as these
 spirits.
What will be the consequence, if we are not able to avail
 ourselves of the resource in question in its full extent? A nation
 cannot long exist without revenues. Destitute of this essential
 support, it must resign its independence, and sink into the degraded
 condition of a province. This is an extremity to which no
 government will of choice accede. Revenue, therefore, must be had
 at all events. In this country, if the principal part be not drawn
 from commerce, it must fall with oppressive weight upon land. It
 has been already intimated that excises, in their true
 signification, are too little in unison with the feelings of the
 people, to admit of great use being made of that mode of taxation;
 nor, indeed, in the States where almost the sole employment is
 agriculture, are the objects proper for excise sufficiently numerous
 to permit very ample collections in that way. Personal estate (as
 has been before remarked), from the difficulty in tracing it, cannot
 be subjected to large contributions, by any other means than by
 taxes on consumption. In populous cities, it may be enough the
 subject of conjecture, to occasion the oppression of individuals,
 without much aggregate benefit to the State; but beyond these
 circles, it must, in a great measure, escape the eye and the hand of
 the tax-gatherer. As the necessities of the State, nevertheless,
 must be satisfied in some mode or other, the defect of other
 resources must throw the principal weight of public burdens on the
 possessors of land. And as, on the other hand, the wants of the
 government can never obtain an adequate supply, unless all the
 sources of revenue are open to its demands, the finances of the
 community, under such embarrassments, cannot be put into a situation
 consistent with its respectability or its security. Thus we shall
 not even have the consolations of a full treasury, to atone for the
 oppression of that valuable class of the citizens who are employed
 in the cultivation of the soil. But public and private distress
 will keep pace with each other in gloomy concert; and unite in
 deploring the infatuation of those counsels which led to disunion.

Advantage of the Union in Respect to Economy in Government
For the Independent Journal.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
As CONNECTED with the subject of revenue, we may with propriety
 consider that of economy. The money saved from one object may be
 usefully applied to another, and there will be so much the less to
 be drawn from the pockets of the people. If the States are united
 under one government, there will be but one national civil list to
 support; if they are divided into several confederacies, there will
 be as many different national civil lists to be provided for--and
 each of them, as to the principal departments, coextensive with that
 which would be necessary for a government of the whole. The entire
 separation of the States into thirteen unconnected sovereignties is
 a project too extravagant and too replete with danger to have many
 advocates. The ideas of men who speculate upon the dismemberment of
 the empire seem generally turned toward three confederacies--one
 consisting of the four Northern, another of the four Middle, and a
 third of the five Southern States. There is little probability that
 there would be a greater number. According to this distribution,
 each confederacy would comprise an extent of territory larger than
 that of the kingdom of Great Britain. No well-informed man will
 suppose that the affairs of such a confederacy can be properly
 regulated by a government less comprehensive in its organs or
 institutions than that which has been proposed by the convention.
 When the dimensions of a State attain to a certain magnitude, it
 requires the same energy of government and the same forms of
 administration which are requisite in one of much greater extent.
 This idea admits not of precise demonstration, because there is no
 rule by which we can measure the momentum of civil power necessary
 to the government of any given number of individuals; but when we
 consider that the island of Britain, nearly commensurate with each
 of the supposed confederacies, contains about eight millions of
 people, and when we reflect upon the degree of authority required to
 direct the passions of so large a society to the public good, we
 shall see no reason to doubt that the like portion of power would be
 sufficient to perform the same task in a society far more numerous.
 Civil power, properly organized and exerted, is capable of
 diffusing its force to a very great extent; and can, in a manner,
 reproduce itself in every part of a great empire by a judicious
 arrangement of subordinate institutions.
The supposition that each confederacy into which the States
 would be likely to be divided would require a government not less
 comprehensive than the one proposed, will be strengthened by another
 supposition, more probable than that which presents us with three
 confederacies as the alternative to a general Union. If we attend
 carefully to geographical and commercial considerations, in
 conjunction with the habits and prejudices of the different States,
 we shall be led to conclude that in case of disunion they will most
 naturally league themselves under two governments. The four Eastern
 States, from all the causes that form the links of national sympathy
 and connection, may with certainty be expected to unite. New York,
 situated as she is, would never be unwise enough to oppose a feeble
 and unsupported flank to the weight of that confederacy. There are
 other obvious reasons that would facilitate her accession to it.
 New Jersey is too small a State to think of being a frontier, in
 opposition to this still more powerful combination; nor do there
 appear to be any obstacles to her admission into it. Even
 Pennsylvania would have strong inducements to join the Northern
 league. An active foreign commerce, on the basis of her own
 navigation, is her true policy, and coincides with the opinions and
 dispositions of her citizens. The more Southern States, from
 various circumstances, may not think themselves much interested in
 the encouragement of navigation. They may prefer a system which
 would give unlimited scope to all nations to be the carriers as well
 as the purchasers of their commodities. Pennsylvania may not choose
 to confound her interests in a connection so adverse to her policy.
 As she must at all events be a frontier, she may deem it most
 consistent with her safety to have her exposed side turned towards
 the weaker power of the Southern, rather than towards the stronger
 power of the Northern, Confederacy. This would give her the fairest
 chance to avoid being the Flanders of America. Whatever may be the
 determination of Pennsylvania, if the Northern Confederacy includes
 New Jersey, there is no likelihood of more than one confederacy to
 the south of that State.
Nothing can be more evident than that the thirteen States will
 be able to support a national government better than one half, or
 one third, or any number less than the whole. This reflection must
 have great weight in obviating that objection to the proposed plan,
 which is founded on the principle of expense; an objection,
 however, which, when we come to take a nearer view of it, will
 appear in every light to stand on mistaken ground.
If, in addition to the consideration of a plurality of civil
 lists, we take into view the number of persons who must necessarily
 be employed to guard the inland communication between the different
 confederacies against illicit trade, and who in time will infallibly
 spring up out of the necessities of revenue; and if we also take
 into view the military establishments which it has been shown would
 unavoidably result from the jealousies and conflicts of the several
 nations into which the States would be divided, we shall clearly
 discover that a separation would be not less injurious to the
 economy, than to the tranquillity, commerce, revenue, and liberty of
 every part.

FEDERALIST No. 14

Objections to the Proposed Constitution From Extent of Territory
 Answered
From the New York Packet.
Friday, November 30, 1787.

MADISON

To the People of the State of New York:
WE HAVE seen the necessity of the Union, as our bulwark against
 foreign danger, as the conservator of peace among ourselves, as the
 guardian of our commerce and other common interests, as the only
 substitute for those military establishments which have subverted
 the liberties of the Old World, and as the proper antidote for the
 diseases of faction, which have proved fatal to other popular
 governments, and of which alarming symptoms have been betrayed by
 our own. All that remains, within this branch of our inquiries, is
 to take notice of an objection that may be drawn from the great
 extent of country which the Union embraces. A few observations on
 this subject will be the more proper, as it is perceived that the
 adversaries of the new Constitution are availing themselves of the
 prevailing prejudice with regard to the practicable sphere of
 republican administration, in order to supply, by imaginary
 difficulties, the want of those solid objections which they endeavor
 in vain to find.
The error which limits republican government to a narrow
 district has been unfolded and refuted in preceding papers. I
 remark here only that it seems to owe its rise and prevalence
 chiefly to the confounding of a republic with a democracy, applying
 to the former reasonings drawn from the nature of the latter. The
 true distinction between these forms was also adverted to on a
 former occasion. It is, that in a democracy, the people meet and
 exercise the government in person; in a republic, they assemble and
 administer it by their representatives and agents. A democracy,
 consequently, will be confined to a small spot. A republic may be
 extended over a large region.
To this accidental source of the error may be added the artifice
 of some celebrated authors, whose writings have had a great share in
 forming the modern standard of political opinions. Being subjects
 either of an absolute or limited monarchy, they have endeavored to
 heighten the advantages, or palliate the evils of those forms, by
 placing in comparison the vices and defects of the republican, and
 by citing as specimens of the latter the turbulent democracies of
 ancient Greece and modern Italy. Under the confusion of names, it
 has been an easy task to transfer to a republic observations
 applicable to a democracy only; and among others, the observation
 that it can never be established but among a small number of people,
 living within a small compass of territory.
Such a fallacy may have been the less perceived, as most of the
 popular governments of antiquity were of the democratic species;
 and even in modern Europe, to which we owe the great principle of
 representation, no example is seen of a government wholly popular,
 and founded, at the same time, wholly on that principle. If Europe
 has the merit of discovering this great mechanical power in
 government, by the simple agency of which the will of the largest
 political body may be concentred, and its force directed to any
 object which the public good requires, America can claim the merit
 of making the discovery the basis of unmixed and extensive republics. 
 It is only to be lamented that any of her citizens should wish to
 deprive her of the additional merit of displaying its full efficacy
 in the establishment of the comprehensive system now under her
 consideration.
As the natural limit of a democracy is that distance from the
 central point which will just permit the most remote citizens to
 assemble as often as their public functions demand, and will include
 no greater number than can join in those functions; so the natural
 limit of a republic is that distance from the centre which will
 barely allow the representatives to meet as often as may be
 necessary for the administration of public affairs. Can it be said
 that the limits of the United States exceed this distance? It will
 not be said by those who recollect that the Atlantic coast is the
 longest side of the Union, that during the term of thirteen years,
 the representatives of the States have been almost continually
 assembled, and that the members from the most distant States are not
 chargeable with greater intermissions of attendance than those from
 the States in the neighborhood of Congress.
That we may form a juster estimate with regard to this
 interesting subject, let us resort to the actual dimensions of the
 Union. The limits, as fixed by the treaty of peace, are: on the
 east the Atlantic, on the south the latitude of thirty-one degrees,
 on the west the Mississippi, and on the north an irregular line
 running in some instances beyond the forty-fifth degree, in others
 falling as low as the forty-second. The southern shore of Lake Erie
 lies below that latitude. Computing the distance between the
 thirty-first and forty-fifth degrees, it amounts to nine hundred and
 seventy-three common miles; computing it from thirty-one to
 forty-two degrees, to seven hundred and sixty-four miles and a half.
 Taking the mean for the distance, the amount will be eight hundred
 and sixty-eight miles and three-fourths. The mean distance from the
 Atlantic to the Mississippi does not probably exceed seven hundred
 and fifty miles. On a comparison of this extent with that of
 several countries in Europe, the practicability of rendering our
 system commensurate to it appears to be demonstrable. It is not a
 great deal larger than Germany, where a diet representing the whole
 empire is continually assembled; or than Poland before the late
 dismemberment, where another national diet was the depositary of the
 supreme power. Passing by France and Spain, we find that in Great
 Britain, inferior as it may be in size, the representatives of the
 northern extremity of the island have as far to travel to the
 national council as will be required of those of the most remote
 parts of the Union.
Favorable as this view of the subject may be, some observations
 remain which will place it in a light still more satisfactory.
In the first place it is to be remembered that the general
 government is not to be charged with the whole power of making and
 administering laws. Its jurisdiction is limited to certain
 enumerated objects, which concern all the members of the republic,
 but which are not to be attained by the separate provisions of any.
 The subordinate governments, which can extend their care to all
 those other subjects which can be separately provided for, will
 retain their due authority and activity. Were it proposed by the
 plan of the convention to abolish the governments of the particular
 States, its adversaries would have some ground for their objection;
 though it would not be difficult to show that if they were
 abolished the general government would be compelled, by the
 principle of self-preservation, to reinstate them in their proper
 jurisdiction.
A second observation to be made is that the immediate object of
 the federal Constitution is to secure the union of the thirteen
 primitive States, which we know to be practicable; and to add to
 them such other States as may arise in their own bosoms, or in their
 neighborhoods, which we cannot doubt to be equally practicable. The
 arrangements that may be necessary for those angles and fractions of
 our territory which lie on our northwestern frontier, must be left
 to those whom further discoveries and experience will render more
 equal to the task.
Let it be remarked, in the third place, that the intercourse
 throughout the Union will be facilitated by new improvements. Roads
 will everywhere be shortened, and kept in better order;
 accommodations for travelers will be multiplied and meliorated; an
 interior navigation on our eastern side will be opened throughout,
 or nearly throughout, the whole extent of the thirteen States. The
 communication between the Western and Atlantic districts, and
 between different parts of each, will be rendered more and more easy
 by those numerous canals with which the beneficence of nature has
 intersected our country, and which art finds it so little difficult
 to connect and complete.
A fourth and still more important consideration is, that as
 almost every State will, on one side or other, be a frontier, and
 will thus find, in regard to its safety, an inducement to make some
 sacrifices for the sake of the general protection; so the States
 which lie at the greatest distance from the heart of the Union, and
 which, of course, may partake least of the ordinary circulation of
 its benefits, will be at the same time immediately contiguous to
 foreign nations, and will consequently stand, on particular
 occasions, in greatest need of its strength and resources. It may
 be inconvenient for Georgia, or the States forming our western or
 northeastern borders, to send their representatives to the seat of
 government; but they would find it more so to struggle alone
 against an invading enemy, or even to support alone the whole
 expense of those precautions which may be dictated by the
 neighborhood of continual danger. If they should derive less
 benefit, therefore, from the Union in some respects than the less
 distant States, they will derive greater benefit from it in other
 respects, and thus the proper equilibrium will be maintained
 throughout.
I submit to you, my fellow-citizens, these considerations, in
 full confidence that the good sense which has so often marked your
 decisions will allow them their due weight and effect; and that you
 will never suffer difficulties, however formidable in appearance, or
 however fashionable the error on which they may be founded, to drive
 you into the gloomy and perilous scene into which the advocates for
 disunion would conduct you. Hearken not to the unnatural voice
 which tells you that the people of America, knit together as they
 are by so many cords of affection, can no longer live together as
 members of the same family; can no longer continue the mutual
 guardians of their mutual happiness; can no longer be
 fellowcitizens of one great, respectable, and flourishing empire.
 Hearken not to the voice which petulantly tells you that the form
 of government recommended for your adoption is a novelty in the
 political world; that it has never yet had a place in the theories
 of the wildest projectors; that it rashly attempts what it is
 impossible to accomplish. No, my countrymen, shut your ears against
 this unhallowed language. Shut your hearts against the poison which
 it conveys; the kindred blood which flows in the veins of American
 citizens, the mingled blood which they have shed in defense of their
 sacred rights, consecrate their Union, and excite horror at the idea
 of their becoming aliens, rivals, enemies. And if novelties are to
 be shunned, believe me, the most alarming of all novelties, the most
 wild of all projects, the most rash of all attempts, is that of
 rendering us in pieces, in order to preserve our liberties and
 promote our happiness. But why is the experiment of an extended
 republic to be rejected, merely because it may comprise what is new?
 Is it not the glory of the people of America, that, whilst they
 have paid a decent regard to the opinions of former times and other
 nations, they have not suffered a blind veneration for antiquity,
 for custom, or for names, to overrule the suggestions of their own
 good sense, the knowledge of their own situation, and the lessons of
 their own experience? To this manly spirit, posterity will be
 indebted for the possession, and the world for the example, of the
 numerous innovations displayed on the American theatre, in favor of
 private rights and public happiness. Had no important step been
 taken by the leaders of the Revolution for which a precedent could
 not be discovered, no government established of which an exact model
 did not present itself, the people of the United States might, at
 this moment have been numbered among the melancholy victims of
 misguided councils, must at best have been laboring under the weight
 of some of those forms which have crushed the liberties of the rest
 of mankind. Happily for America, happily, we trust, for the whole
 human race, they pursued a new and more noble course. They
 accomplished a revolution which has no parallel in the annals of
 human society. They reared the fabrics of governments which have no
 model on the face of the globe. They formed the design of a great
 Confederacy, which it is incumbent on their successors to improve
 and perpetuate. If their works betray imperfections, we wonder at
 the fewness of them. If they erred most in the structure of the
 Union, this was the work most difficult to be executed; this is the
 work which has been new modelled by the act of your convention, and
 it is that act on which you are now to deliberate and to decide.

The Insufficiency of the Present Confederation to Preserve the
 Union
For the Independent Journal.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York.
IN THE course of the preceding papers, I have endeavored, my
 fellow-citizens, to place before you, in a clear and convincing
 light, the importance of Union to your political safety and
 happiness. I have unfolded to you a complication of dangers to
 which you would be exposed, should you permit that sacred knot which
 binds the people of America together be severed or dissolved by
 ambition or by avarice, by jealousy or by misrepresentation. In the
 sequel of the inquiry through which I propose to accompany you, the
 truths intended to be inculcated will receive further confirmation
 from facts and arguments hitherto unnoticed. If the road over which
 you will still have to pass should in some places appear to you
 tedious or irksome, you will recollect that you are in quest of
 information on a subject the most momentous which can engage the
 attention of a free people, that the field through which you have to
 travel is in itself spacious, and that the difficulties of the
 journey have been unnecessarily increased by the mazes with which
 sophistry has beset the way. It will be my aim to remove the
 obstacles from your progress in as compendious a manner as it can be
 done, without sacrificing utility to despatch.
In pursuance of the plan which I have laid down for the
 discussion of the subject, the point next in order to be examined is
 the ``insufficiency of the present Confederation to the preservation
 of the Union.'' It may perhaps be asked what need there is of
 reasoning or proof to illustrate a position which is not either
 controverted or doubted, to which the understandings and feelings of
 all classes of men assent, and which in substance is admitted by the
 opponents as well as by the friends of the new Constitution. It
 must in truth be acknowledged that, however these may differ in
 other respects, they in general appear to harmonize in this
 sentiment, at least, that there are material imperfections in our
 national system, and that something is necessary to be done to
 rescue us from impending anarchy. The facts that support this
 opinion are no longer objects of speculation. They have forced
 themselves upon the sensibility of the people at large, and have at
 length extorted from those, whose mistaken policy has had the
 principal share in precipitating the extremity at which we are
 arrived, a reluctant confession of the reality of those defects in
 the scheme of our federal government, which have been long pointed
 out and regretted by the intelligent friends of the Union.
We may indeed with propriety be said to have reached almost the
 last stage of national humiliation. There is scarcely anything that
 can wound the pride or degrade the character of an independent
 nation which we do not experience. Are there engagements to the
 performance of which we are held by every tie respectable among men?
 These are the subjects of constant and unblushing violation. Do we
 owe debts to foreigners and to our own citizens contracted in a time
 of imminent peril for the preservation of our political existence?
 These remain without any proper or satisfactory provision for their
 discharge. Have we valuable territories and important posts in the
 possession of a foreign power which, by express stipulations, ought
 long since to have been surrendered? These are still retained, to
 the prejudice of our interests, not less than of our rights. Are we
 in a condition to resent or to repel the aggression? We have
 neither troops, nor treasury, nor government.1 Are we even in a
 condition to remonstrate with dignity? The just imputations on our
 own faith, in respect to the same treaty, ought first to be removed.
 Are we entitled by nature and compact to a free participation in
 the navigation of the Mississippi? Spain excludes us from it. Is
 public credit an indispensable resource in time of public danger?
 We seem to have abandoned its cause as desperate and irretrievable.
 Is commerce of importance to national wealth? Ours is at the
 lowest point of declension. Is respectability in the eyes of
 foreign powers a safeguard against foreign encroachments? The
 imbecility of our government even forbids them to treat with us.
 Our ambassadors abroad are the mere pageants of mimic sovereignty.
 Is a violent and unnatural decrease in the value of land a symptom
 of national distress? The price of improved land in most parts of
 the country is much lower than can be accounted for by the quantity
 of waste land at market, and can only be fully explained by that
 want of private and public confidence, which are so alarmingly
 prevalent among all ranks, and which have a direct tendency to
 depreciate property of every kind. Is private credit the friend and
 patron of industry? That most useful kind which relates to
 borrowing and lending is reduced within the narrowest limits, and
 this still more from an opinion of insecurity than from the scarcity
 of money. To shorten an enumeration of particulars which can afford
 neither pleasure nor instruction, it may in general be demanded,
 what indication is there of national disorder, poverty, and
 insignificance that could befall a community so peculiarly blessed
 with natural advantages as we are, which does not form a part of the
 dark catalogue of our public misfortunes?
This is the melancholy situation to which we have been brought
 by those very maxims and councils which would now deter us from
 adopting the proposed Constitution; and which, not content with
 having conducted us to the brink of a precipice, seem resolved to
 plunge us into the abyss that awaits us below. Here, my countrymen,
 impelled by every motive that ought to influence an enlightened
 people, let us make a firm stand for our safety, our tranquillity,
 our dignity, our reputation. Let us at last break the fatal charm
 which has too long seduced us from the paths of felicity and
 prosperity.
It is true, as has been before observed that facts, too stubborn
 to be resisted, have produced a species of general assent to the
 abstract proposition that there exist material defects in our
 national system; but the usefulness of the concession, on the part
 of the old adversaries of federal measures, is destroyed by a
 strenuous opposition to a remedy, upon the only principles that can
 give it a chance of success. While they admit that the government
 of the United States is destitute of energy, they contend against
 conferring upon it those powers which are requisite to supply that
 energy. They seem still to aim at things repugnant and
 irreconcilable; at an augmentation of federal authority, without a
 diminution of State authority; at sovereignty in the Union, and
 complete independence in the members. They still, in fine, seem to
 cherish with blind devotion the political monster of an imperium
 in imperio. This renders a full display of the principal defects
 of the Confederation necessary, in order to show that the evils we
 experience do not proceed from minute or partial imperfections, but
 from fundamental errors in the structure of the building, which
 cannot be amended otherwise than by an alteration in the first
 principles and main pillars of the fabric.
The great and radical vice in the construction of the existing
 Confederation is in the principle of LEGISLATION for STATES or
 GOVERNMENTS, in their CORPORATE or COLLECTIVE CAPACITIES, and as
 contradistinguished from the INDIVIDUALS of which they consist.
 Though this principle does not run through all the powers delegated
 to the Union, yet it pervades and governs those on which the
 efficacy of the rest depends. Except as to the rule of appointment,
 the United States has an indefinite discretion to make requisitions
 for men and money; but they have no authority to raise either, by
 regulations extending to the individual citizens of America. The
 consequence of this is, that though in theory their resolutions
 concerning those objects are laws, constitutionally binding on the
 members of the Union, yet in practice they are mere recommendations
 which the States observe or disregard at their option.
It is a singular instance of the capriciousness of the human
 mind, that after all the admonitions we have had from experience on
 this head, there should still be found men who object to the new
 Constitution, for deviating from a principle which has been found
 the bane of the old, and which is in itself evidently incompatible
 with the idea of GOVERNMENT; a principle, in short, which, if it is
 to be executed at all, must substitute the violent and sanguinary
 agency of the sword to the mild influence of the magistracy.
There is nothing absurd or impracticable in the idea of a league
 or alliance between independent nations for certain defined purposes
 precisely stated in a treaty regulating all the details of time,
 place, circumstance, and quantity; leaving nothing to future
 discretion; and depending for its execution on the good faith of
 the parties. Compacts of this kind exist among all civilized
 nations, subject to the usual vicissitudes of peace and war, of
 observance and non-observance, as the interests or passions of the
 contracting powers dictate. In the early part of the present
 century there was an epidemical rage in Europe for this species of
 compacts, from which the politicians of the times fondly hoped for
 benefits which were never realized. With a view to establishing the
 equilibrium of power and the peace of that part of the world, all
 the resources of negotiation were exhausted, and triple and
 quadruple alliances were formed; but they were scarcely formed
 before they were broken, giving an instructive but afflicting lesson
 to mankind, how little dependence is to be placed on treaties which
 have no other sanction than the obligations of good faith, and which
 oppose general considerations of peace and justice to the impulse of
 any immediate interest or passion.
If the particular States in this country are disposed to stand
 in a similar relation to each other, and to drop the project of a
 general DISCRETIONARY SUPERINTENDENCE, the scheme would indeed be
 pernicious, and would entail upon us all the mischiefs which have
 been enumerated under the first head; but it would have the merit
 of being, at least, consistent and practicable Abandoning all views
 towards a confederate government, this would bring us to a simple
 alliance offensive and defensive; and would place us in a situation
 to be alternate friends and enemies of each other, as our mutual
 jealousies and rivalships, nourished by the intrigues of foreign
 nations, should prescribe to us.
But if we are unwilling to be placed in this perilous situation;
 if we still will adhere to the design of a national government, or,
 which is the same thing, of a superintending power, under the
 direction of a common council, we must resolve to incorporate into
 our plan those ingredients which may be considered as forming the
 characteristic difference between a league and a government; we
 must extend the authority of the Union to the persons of the
 citizens, --the only proper objects of government.
Government implies the power of making laws. It is essential to
 the idea of a law, that it be attended with a sanction; or, in
 other words, a penalty or punishment for disobedience. If there be
 no penalty annexed to disobedience, the resolutions or commands
 which pretend to be laws will, in fact, amount to nothing more than
 advice or recommendation. This penalty, whatever it may be, can
 only be inflicted in two ways: by the agency of the courts and
 ministers of justice, or by military force; by the COERCION of the
 magistracy, or by the COERCION of arms. The first kind can
 evidently apply only to men; the last kind must of necessity, be
 employed against bodies politic, or communities, or States. It is
 evident that there is no process of a court by which the observance
 of the laws can, in the last resort, be enforced. Sentences may be
 denounced against them for violations of their duty; but these
 sentences can only be carried into execution by the sword. In an
 association where the general authority is confined to the
 collective bodies of the communities, that compose it, every breach
 of the laws must involve a state of war; and military execution
 must become the only instrument of civil obedience. Such a state of
 things can certainly not deserve the name of government, nor would
 any prudent man choose to commit his happiness to it.
There was a time when we were told that breaches, by the States,
 of the regulations of the federal authority were not to be expected;
 that a sense of common interest would preside over the conduct of
 the respective members, and would beget a full compliance with all
 the constitutional requisitions of the Union. This language, at the
 present day, would appear as wild as a great part of what we now
 hear from the same quarter will be thought, when we shall have
 received further lessons from that best oracle of wisdom, experience. 
 It at all times betrayed an ignorance of the true springs by which
 human conduct is actuated, and belied the original inducements to
 the establishment of civil power. Why has government been
 instituted at all? Because the passions of men will not conform to
 the dictates of reason and justice, without constraint. Has it been
 found that bodies of men act with more rectitude or greater
 disinterestedness than individuals? The contrary of this has been
 inferred by all accurate observers of the conduct of mankind; and
 the inference is founded upon obvious reasons. Regard to reputation
 has a less active influence, when the infamy of a bad action is to
 be divided among a number than when it is to fall singly upon one.
 A spirit of faction, which is apt to mingle its poison in the
 deliberations of all bodies of men, will often hurry the persons of
 whom they are composed into improprieties and excesses, for which
 they would blush in a private capacity.
In addition to all this, there is, in the nature of sovereign
 power, an impatience of control, that disposes those who are
 invested with the exercise of it, to look with an evil eye upon all
 external attempts to restrain or direct its operations. From this
 spirit it happens, that in every political association which is
 formed upon the principle of uniting in a common interest a number
 of lesser sovereignties, there will be found a kind of eccentric
 tendency in the subordinate or inferior orbs, by the operation of
 which there will be a perpetual effort in each to fly off from the
 common centre. This tendency is not difficult to be accounted for.
 It has its origin in the love of power. Power controlled or
 abridged is almost always the rival and enemy of that power by which
 it is controlled or abridged. This simple proposition will teach us
 how little reason there is to expect, that the persons intrusted
 with the administration of the affairs of the particular members of
 a confederacy will at all times be ready, with perfect good-humor,
 and an unbiased regard to the public weal, to execute the
 resolutions or decrees of the general authority. The reverse of
 this results from the constitution of human nature.
If, therefore, the measures of the Confederacy cannot be
 executed without the intervention of the particular administrations,
 there will be little prospect of their being executed at all. The
 rulers of the respective members, whether they have a constitutional
 right to do it or not, will undertake to judge of the propriety of
 the measures themselves. They will consider the conformity of the
 thing proposed or required to their immediate interests or aims;
 the momentary conveniences or inconveniences that would attend its
 adoption. All this will be done; and in a spirit of interested and
 suspicious scrutiny, without that knowledge of national
 circumstances and reasons of state, which is essential to a right
 judgment, and with that strong predilection in favor of local
 objects, which can hardly fail to mislead the decision. The same
 process must be repeated in every member of which the body is
 constituted; and the execution of the plans, framed by the councils
 of the whole, will always fluctuate on the discretion of the
 ill-informed and prejudiced opinion of every part. Those who have
 been conversant in the proceedings of popular assemblies; who have
 seen how difficult it often is, where there is no exterior pressure
 of circumstances, to bring them to harmonious resolutions on
 important points, will readily conceive how impossible it must be to
 induce a number of such assemblies, deliberating at a distance from
 each other, at different times, and under different impressions,
 long to co-operate in the same views and pursuits.
In our case, the concurrence of thirteen distinct sovereign
 wills is requisite, under the Confederation, to the complete
 execution of every important measure that proceeds from the Union.
 It has happened as was to have been foreseen. The measures of the
 Union have not been executed; the delinquencies of the States have,
 step by step, matured themselves to an extreme, which has, at
 length, arrested all the wheels of the national government, and
 brought them to an awful stand. Congress at this time scarcely
 possess the means of keeping up the forms of administration, till
 the States can have time to agree upon a more substantial substitute
 for the present shadow of a federal government. Things did not come
 to this desperate extremity at once. The causes which have been
 specified produced at first only unequal and disproportionate
 degrees of compliance with the requisitions of the Union. The
 greater deficiencies of some States furnished the pretext of example
 and the temptation of interest to the complying, or to the least
 delinquent States. Why should we do more in proportion than those
 who are embarked with us in the same political voyage? Why should
 we consent to bear more than our proper share of the common burden?
 These were suggestions which human selfishness could not withstand,
 and which even speculative men, who looked forward to remote
 consequences, could not, without hesitation, combat. Each State,
 yielding to the persuasive voice of immediate interest or
 convenience, has successively withdrawn its support, till the frail
 and tottering edifice seems ready to fall upon our heads, and to
 crush us beneath its ruins.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
THE tendency of the principle of legislation for States, or
 communities, in their political capacities, as it has been
 exemplified by the experiment we have made of it, is equally
 attested by the events which have befallen all other governments of
 the confederate kind, of which we have any account, in exact
 proportion to its prevalence in those systems. The confirmations of
 this fact will be worthy of a distinct and particular examination.
 I shall content myself with barely observing here, that of all the
 confederacies of antiquity, which history has handed down to us, the
 Lycian and Achaean leagues, as far as there remain vestiges of them,
 appear to have been most free from the fetters of that mistaken
 principle, and were accordingly those which have best deserved, and
 have most liberally received, the applauding suffrages of political
 writers.
This exceptionable principle may, as truly as emphatically, be
 styled the parent of anarchy: It has been seen that delinquencies
 in the members of the Union are its natural and necessary offspring;
 and that whenever they happen, the only constitutional remedy is
 force, and the immediate effect of the use of it, civil war.
It remains to inquire how far so odious an engine of government,
 in its application to us, would even be capable of answering its end. 
 If there should not be a large army constantly at the disposal of
 the national government it would either not be able to employ force
 at all, or, when this could be done, it would amount to a war
 between parts of the Confederacy concerning the infractions of a
 league, in which the strongest combination would be most likely to
 prevail, whether it consisted of those who supported or of those who
 resisted the general authority. It would rarely happen that the
 delinquency to be redressed would be confined to a single member,
 and if there were more than one who had neglected their duty,
 similarity of situation would induce them to unite for common
 defense. Independent of this motive of sympathy, if a large and
 influential State should happen to be the aggressing member, it
 would commonly have weight enough with its neighbors to win over
 some of them as associates to its cause. Specious arguments of
 danger to the common liberty could easily be contrived; plausible
 excuses for the deficiencies of the party could, without difficulty,
 be invented to alarm the apprehensions, inflame the passions, and
 conciliate the good-will, even of those States which were not
 chargeable with any violation or omission of duty. This would be
 the more likely to take place, as the delinquencies of the larger
 members might be expected sometimes to proceed from an ambitious
 premeditation in their rulers, with a view to getting rid of all
 external control upon their designs of personal aggrandizement; the
 better to effect which it is presumable they would tamper beforehand
 with leading individuals in the adjacent States. If associates
 could not be found at home, recourse would be had to the aid of
 foreign powers, who would seldom be disinclined to encouraging the
 dissensions of a Confederacy, from the firm union of which they had
 so much to fear. When the sword is once drawn, the passions of men
 observe no bounds of moderation. The suggestions of wounded pride,
 the instigations of irritated resentment, would be apt to carry the
 States against which the arms of the Union were exerted, to any
 extremes necessary to avenge the affront or to avoid the disgrace of
 submission. The first war of this kind would probably terminate in
 a dissolution of the Union.
This may be considered as the violent death of the Confederacy.
 Its more natural death is what we now seem to be on the point of
 experiencing, if the federal system be not speedily renovated in a
 more substantial form. It is not probable, considering the genius
 of this country, that the complying States would often be inclined
 to support the authority of the Union by engaging in a war against
 the non-complying States. They would always be more ready to pursue
 the milder course of putting themselves upon an equal footing with
 the delinquent members by an imitation of their example. And the
 guilt of all would thus become the security of all. Our past
 experience has exhibited the operation of this spirit in its full
 light. There would, in fact, be an insuperable difficulty in
 ascertaining when force could with propriety be employed. In the
 article of pecuniary contribution, which would be the most usual
 source of delinquency, it would often be impossible to decide
 whether it had proceeded from disinclination or inability. The
 pretense of the latter would always be at hand. And the case must
 be very flagrant in which its fallacy could be detected with
 sufficient certainty to justify the harsh expedient of compulsion.
 It is easy to see that this problem alone, as often as it should
 occur, would open a wide field for the exercise of factious views,
 of partiality, and of oppression, in the majority that happened to
 prevail in the national council.
It seems to require no pains to prove that the States ought not
 to prefer a national Constitution which could only be kept in motion
 by the instrumentality of a large army continually on foot to
 execute the ordinary requisitions or decrees of the government. And
 yet this is the plain alternative involved by those who wish to deny
 it the power of extending its operations to individuals. Such a
 scheme, if practicable at all, would instantly degenerate into a
 military despotism; but it will be found in every light
 impracticable. The resources of the Union would not be equal to the
 maintenance of an army considerable enough to confine the larger
 States within the limits of their duty; nor would the means ever be
 furnished of forming such an army in the first instance. Whoever
 considers the populousness and strength of several of these States
 singly at the present juncture, and looks forward to what they will
 become, even at the distance of half a century, will at once dismiss
 as idle and visionary any scheme which aims at regulating their
 movements by laws to operate upon them in their collective
 capacities, and to be executed by a coercion applicable to them in
 the same capacities. A project of this kind is little less romantic
 than the monster-taming spirit which is attributed to the fabulous
 heroes and demi-gods of antiquity.
Even in those confederacies which have been composed of members
 smaller than many of our counties, the principle of legislation for
 sovereign States, supported by military coercion, has never been
 found effectual. It has rarely been attempted to be employed, but
 against the weaker members; and in most instances attempts to
 coerce the refractory and disobedient have been the signals of
 bloody wars, in which one half of the confederacy has displayed its
 banners against the other half.
The result of these observations to an intelligent mind must be
 clearly this, that if it be possible at any rate to construct a
 federal government capable of regulating the common concerns and
 preserving the general tranquillity, it must be founded, as to the
 objects committed to its care, upon the reverse of the principle
 contended for by the opponents of the proposed Constitution. It
 must carry its agency to the persons of the citizens. It must stand
 in need of no intermediate legislations; but must itself be
 empowered to employ the arm of the ordinary magistrate to execute
 its own resolutions. The majesty of the national authority must be
 manifested through the medium of the courts of justice. The
 government of the Union, like that of each State, must be able to
 address itself immediately to the hopes and fears of individuals;
 and to attract to its support those passions which have the
 strongest influence upon the human heart. It must, in short,
 possess all the means, and have aright to resort to all the methods,
 of executing the powers with which it is intrusted, that are
 possessed and exercised by the government of the particular States.
To this reasoning it may perhaps be objected, that if any State
 should be disaffected to the authority of the Union, it could at any
 time obstruct the execution of its laws, and bring the matter to the
 same issue of force, with the necessity of which the opposite scheme
 is reproached.
The pausibility of this objection will vanish the moment we
 advert to the essential difference between a mere NON-COMPLIANCE and
 a DIRECT and ACTIVE RESISTANCE. If the interposition of the State
 legislatures be necessary to give effect to a measure of the Union,
 they have only NOT TO ACT, or to ACT EVASIVELY, and the measure is
 defeated. This neglect of duty may be disguised under affected but
 unsubstantial provisions, so as not to appear, and of course not to
 excite any alarm in the people for the safety of the Constitution.
 The State leaders may even make a merit of their surreptitious
 invasions of it on the ground of some temporary convenience,
 exemption, or advantage.
But if the execution of the laws of the national government
 should not require the intervention of the State legislatures, if
 they were to pass into immediate operation upon the citizens
 themselves, the particular governments could not interrupt their
 progress without an open and violent exertion of an unconstitutional
 power. No omissions nor evasions would answer the end. They would
 be obliged to act, and in such a manner as would leave no doubt that
 they had encroached on the national rights. An experiment of this
 nature would always be hazardous in the face of a constitution in
 any degree competent to its own defense, and of a people enlightened
 enough to distinguish between a legal exercise and an illegal
 usurpation of authority. The success of it would require not merely
 a factious majority in the legislature, but the concurrence of the
 courts of justice and of the body of the people. If the judges were
 not embarked in a conspiracy with the legislature, they would
 pronounce the resolutions of such a majority to be contrary to the
 supreme law of the land, unconstitutional, and void. If the people
 were not tainted with the spirit of their State representatives,
 they, as the natural guardians of the Constitution, would throw
 their weight into the national scale and give it a decided
 preponderancy in the contest. Attempts of this kind would not often
 be made with levity or rashness, because they could seldom be made
 without danger to the authors, unless in cases of a tyrannical
 exercise of the federal authority.
If opposition to the national government should arise from the
 disorderly conduct of refractory or seditious individuals, it could
 be overcome by the same means which are daily employed against the
 same evil under the State governments. The magistracy, being
 equally the ministers of the law of the land, from whatever source
 it might emanate, would doubtless be as ready to guard the national
 as the local regulations from the inroads of private licentiousness.
 As to those partial commotions and insurrections, which sometimes
 disquiet society, from the intrigues of an inconsiderable faction,
 or from sudden or occasional illhumors that do not infect the great
 body of the community the general government could command more
 extensive resources for the suppression of disturbances of that kind
 than would be in the power of any single member. And as to those
 mortal feuds which, in certain conjunctures, spread a conflagration
 through a whole nation, or through a very large proportion of it,
 proceeding either from weighty causes of discontent given by the
 government or from the contagion of some violent popular paroxysm,
 they do not fall within any ordinary rules of calculation. When
 they happen, they commonly amount to revolutions and dismemberments
 of empire. No form of government can always either avoid or control
 them. It is in vain to hope to guard against events too mighty for
 human foresight or precaution, and it would be idle to object to a
 government because it could not perform impossibilities.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
AN OBJECTION, of a nature different from that which has been
 stated and answered, in my last address, may perhaps be likewise
 urged against the principle of legislation for the individual
 citizens of America. It may be said that it would tend to render
 the government of the Union too powerful, and to enable it to absorb
 those residuary authorities, which it might be judged proper to
 leave with the States for local purposes. Allowing the utmost
 latitude to the love of power which any reasonable man can require,
 I confess I am at a loss to discover what temptation the persons
 intrusted with the administration of the general government could
 ever feel to divest the States of the authorities of that
 description. The regulation of the mere domestic police of a State
 appears to me to hold out slender allurements to ambition.
 Commerce, finance, negotiation, and war seem to comprehend all the
 objects which have charms for minds governed by that passion; and
 all the powers necessary to those objects ought, in the first
 instance, to be lodged in the national depository. The
 administration of private justice between the citizens of the same
 State, the supervision of agriculture and of other concerns of a
 similar nature, all those things, in short, which are proper to be
 provided for by local legislation, can never be desirable cares of a
 general jurisdiction. It is therefore improbable that there should
 exist a disposition in the federal councils to usurp the powers with
 which they are connected; because the attempt to exercise those
 powers would be as troublesome as it would be nugatory; and the
 possession of them, for that reason, would contribute nothing to the
 dignity, to the importance, or to the splendor of the national
 government.
But let it be admitted, for argument's sake, that mere
 wantonness and lust of domination would be sufficient to beget that
 disposition; still it may be safely affirmed, that the sense of the
 constituent body of the national representatives, or, in other
 words, the people of the several States, would control the
 indulgence of so extravagant an appetite. It will always be far
 more easy for the State governments to encroach upon the national
 authorities than for the national government to encroach upon the
 State authorities. The proof of this proposition turns upon the
 greater degree of influence which the State governments if they
 administer their affairs with uprightness and prudence, will
 generally possess over the people; a circumstance which at the same
 time teaches us that there is an inherent and intrinsic weakness in
 all federal constitutions; and that too much pains cannot be taken
 in their organization, to give them all the force which is
 compatible with the principles of liberty.
The superiority of influence in favor of the particular
 governments would result partly from the diffusive construction of
 the national government, but chiefly from the nature of the objects
 to which the attention of the State administrations would be
 directed.
It is a known fact in human nature, that its affections are
 commonly weak in proportion to the distance or diffusiveness of the
 object. Upon the same principle that a man is more attached to his
 family than to his neighborhood, to his neighborhood than to the
 community at large, the people of each State would be apt to feel a
 stronger bias towards their local governments than towards the
 government of the Union; unless the force of that principle should
 be destroyed by a much better administration of the latter.
This strong propensity of the human heart would find powerful
 auxiliaries in the objects of State regulation.
The variety of more minute interests, which will necessarily
 fall under the superintendence of the local administrations, and
 which will form so many rivulets of influence, running through every
 part of the society, cannot be particularized, without involving a
 detail too tedious and uninteresting to compensate for the
 instruction it might afford.
There is one transcendant advantage belonging to the province of
 the State governments, which alone suffices to place the matter in a
 clear and satisfactory light,--I mean the ordinary administration of
 criminal and civil justice. This, of all others, is the most
 powerful, most universal, and most attractive source of popular
 obedience and attachment. It is that which, being the immediate and
 visible guardian of life and property, having its benefits and its
 terrors in constant activity before the public eye, regulating all
 those personal interests and familiar concerns to which the
 sensibility of individuals is more immediately awake, contributes,
 more than any other circumstance, to impressing upon the minds of
 the people, affection, esteem, and reverence towards the government.
 This great cement of society, which will diffuse itself almost
 wholly through the channels of the particular governments,
 independent of all other causes of influence, would insure them so
 decided an empire over their respective citizens as to render them
 at all times a complete counterpoise, and, not unfrequently,
 dangerous rivals to the power of the Union.
The operations of the national government, on the other hand,
 falling less immediately under the observation of the mass of the
 citizens, the benefits derived from it will chiefly be perceived and
 attended to by speculative men. Relating to more general interests,
 they will be less apt to come home to the feelings of the people;
 and, in proportion, less likely to inspire an habitual sense of
 obligation, and an active sentiment of attachment.
The reasoning on this head has been abundantly exemplified by
 the experience of all federal constitutions with which we are
 acquainted, and of all others which have borne the least analogy to
 them.
Though the ancient feudal systems were not, strictly speaking,
 confederacies, yet they partook of the nature of that species of
 association. There was a common head, chieftain, or sovereign,
 whose authority extended over the whole nation; and a number of
 subordinate vassals, or feudatories, who had large portions of land
 allotted to them, and numerous trains of INFERIOR vassals or
 retainers, who occupied and cultivated that land upon the tenure of
 fealty or obedience, to the persons of whom they held it. Each
 principal vassal was a kind of sovereign, within his particular
 demesnes. The consequences of this situation were a continual
 opposition to authority of the sovereign, and frequent wars between
 the great barons or chief feudatories themselves. The power of the
 head of the nation was commonly too weak, either to preserve the
 public peace, or to protect the people against the oppressions of
 their immediate lords. This period of European affairs is
 emphatically styled by historians, the times of feudal anarchy.
When the sovereign happened to be a man of vigorous and warlike
 temper and of superior abilities, he would acquire a personal weight
 and influence, which answered, for the time, the purpose of a more
 regular authority. But in general, the power of the barons
 triumphed over that of the prince; and in many instances his
 dominion was entirely thrown off, and the great fiefs were erected
 into independent principalities or States. In those instances in
 which the monarch finally prevailed over his vassals, his success
 was chiefly owing to the tyranny of those vassals over their
 dependents. The barons, or nobles, equally the enemies of the
 sovereign and the oppressors of the common people, were dreaded and
 detested by both; till mutual danger and mutual interest effected a
 union between them fatal to the power of the aristocracy. Had the
 nobles, by a conduct of clemency and justice, preserved the fidelity
 and devotion of their retainers and followers, the contests between
 them and the prince must almost always have ended in their favor,
 and in the abridgment or subversion of the royal authority.
This is not an assertion founded merely in speculation or
 conjecture. Among other illustrations of its truth which might be
 cited, Scotland will furnish a cogent example. The spirit of
 clanship which was, at an early day, introduced into that kingdom,
 uniting the nobles and their dependants by ties equivalent to those
 of kindred, rendered the aristocracy a constant overmatch for the
 power of the monarch, till the incorporation with England subdued
 its fierce and ungovernable spirit, and reduced it within those
 rules of subordination which a more rational and more energetic
 system of civil polity had previously established in the latter
 kingdom.
The separate governments in a confederacy may aptly be compared
 with the feudal baronies; with this advantage in their favor, that
 from the reasons already explained, they will generally possess the
 confidence and good-will of the people, and with so important a
 support, will be able effectually to oppose all encroachments of the
 national government. It will be well if they are not able to
 counteract its legitimate and necessary authority. The points of
 similitude consist in the rivalship of power, applicable to both,
 and in the CONCENTRATION of large portions of the strength of the
 community into particular DEPOSITS, in one case at the disposal of
 individuals, in the other case at the disposal of political bodies.
A concise review of the events that have attended confederate
 governments will further illustrate this important doctrine; an
 inattention to which has been the great source of our political
 mistakes, and has given our jealousy a direction to the wrong side.
 This review shall form the subject of some ensuing papers.

HAMILTON AND MADISON

To the People of the State of New York:
AMONG the confederacies of antiquity, the most considerable was
 that of the Grecian republics, associated under the Amphictyonic
 council. From the best accounts transmitted of this celebrated
 institution, it bore a very instructive analogy to the present
 Confederation of the American States.
The members retained the character of independent and sovereign
 states, and had equal votes in the federal council. This council
 had a general authority to propose and resolve whatever it judged
 necessary for the common welfare of Greece; to declare and carry on
 war; to decide, in the last resort, all controversies between the
 members; to fine the aggressing party; to employ the whole force
 of the confederacy against the disobedient; to admit new members.
 The Amphictyons were the guardians of religion, and of the immense
 riches belonging to the temple of Delphos, where they had the right
 of jurisdiction in controversies between the inhabitants and those
 who came to consult the oracle. As a further provision for the
 efficacy of the federal powers, they took an oath mutually to defend
 and protect the united cities, to punish the violators of this oath,
 and to inflict vengeance on sacrilegious despoilers of the temple.
In theory, and upon paper, this apparatus of powers seems amply
 sufficient for all general purposes. In several material instances,
 they exceed the powers enumerated in the articles of confederation.
 The Amphictyons had in their hands the superstition of the times,
 one of the principal engines by which government was then
 maintained; they had a declared authority to use coercion against
 refractory cities, and were bound by oath to exert this authority on
 the necessary occasions.
Very different, nevertheless, was the experiment from the theory. 
 The powers, like those of the present Congress, were administered
 by deputies appointed wholly by the cities in their political
 capacities; and exercised over them in the same capacities. Hence
 the weakness, the disorders, and finally the destruction of the
 confederacy. The more powerful members, instead of being kept in
 awe and subordination, tyrannized successively over all the rest.
 Athens, as we learn from Demosthenes, was the arbiter of Greece
 seventy-three years. The Lacedaemonians next governed it
 twenty-nine years; at a subsequent period, after the battle of
 Leuctra, the Thebans had their turn of domination.
It happened but too often, according to Plutarch, that the
 deputies of the strongest cities awed and corrupted those of the
 weaker; and that judgment went in favor of the most powerful party.
Even in the midst of defensive and dangerous wars with Persia
 and Macedon, the members never acted in concert, and were, more or
 fewer of them, eternally the dupes or the hirelings of the common
 enemy. The intervals of foreign war were filled up by domestic
 vicissitudes convulsions, and carnage.
After the conclusion of the war with Xerxes, it appears that the
 Lacedaemonians required that a number of the cities should be turned
 out of the confederacy for the unfaithful part they had acted. The
 Athenians, finding that the Lacedaemonians would lose fewer
 partisans by such a measure than themselves, and would become
 masters of the public deliberations, vigorously opposed and defeated
 the attempt. This piece of history proves at once the inefficiency
 of the union, the ambition and jealousy of its most powerful
 members, and the dependent and degraded condition of the rest. The
 smaller members, though entitled by the theory of their system to
 revolve in equal pride and majesty around the common center, had
 become, in fact, satellites of the orbs of primary magnitude.
Had the Greeks, says the Abbe Milot, been as wise as they were
 courageous, they would have been admonished by experience of the
 necessity of a closer union, and would have availed themselves of
 the peace which followed their success against the Persian arms, to
 establish such a reformation. Instead of this obvious policy,
 Athens and Sparta, inflated with the victories and the glory they
 had acquired, became first rivals and then enemies; and did each
 other infinitely more mischief than they had suffered from Xerxes.
 Their mutual jealousies, fears, hatreds, and injuries ended in the
 celebrated Peloponnesian war; which itself ended in the ruin and
 slavery of the Athenians who had begun it.
As a weak government, when not at war, is ever agitated by
 internal dissentions, so these never fail to bring on fresh
 calamities from abroad. The Phocians having ploughed up some
 consecrated ground belonging to the temple of Apollo, the
 Amphictyonic council, according to the superstition of the age,
 imposed a fine on the sacrilegious offenders. The Phocians, being
 abetted by Athens and Sparta, refused to submit to the decree. The
 Thebans, with others of the cities, undertook to maintain the
 authority of the Amphictyons, and to avenge the violated god. The
 latter, being the weaker party, invited the assistance of Philip of
 Macedon, who had secretly fostered the contest. Philip gladly
 seized the opportunity of executing the designs he had long planned
 against the liberties of Greece. By his intrigues and bribes he won
 over to his interests the popular leaders of several cities; by
 their influence and votes, gained admission into the Amphictyonic
 council; and by his arts and his arms, made himself master of the
 confederacy.
Such were the consequences of the fallacious principle on which
 this interesting establishment was founded. Had Greece, says a
 judicious observer on her fate, been united by a stricter
 confederation, and persevered in her union, she would never have
 worn the chains of Macedon; and might have proved a barrier to the
 vast projects of Rome.
The Achaean league, as it is called, was another society of
 Grecian republics, which supplies us with valuable instruction.
The Union here was far more intimate, and its organization much
 wiser, than in the preceding instance. It will accordingly appear,
 that though not exempt from a similar catastrophe, it by no means
 equally deserved it.
The cities composing this league retained their municipal
 jurisdiction, appointed their own officers, and enjoyed a perfect
 equality. The senate, in which they were represented, had the sole
 and exclusive right of peace and war; of sending and receiving
 ambassadors; of entering into treaties and alliances; of
 appointing a chief magistrate or praetor, as he was called, who
 commanded their armies, and who, with the advice and consent of ten
 of the senators, not only administered the government in the recess
 of the senate, but had a great share in its deliberations, when
 assembled. According to the primitive constitution, there were two
 praetors associated in the administration; but on trial a single
 one was preferred.
It appears that the cities had all the same laws and customs,
 the same weights and measures, and the same money. But how far this
 effect proceeded from the authority of the federal council is left
 in uncertainty. It is said only that the cities were in a manner
 compelled to receive the same laws and usages. When Lacedaemon was
 brought into the league by Philopoemen, it was attended with an
 abolition of the institutions and laws of Lycurgus, and an adoption
 of those of the Achaeans. The Amphictyonic confederacy, of which
 she had been a member, left her in the full exercise of her
 government and her legislation. This circumstance alone proves a
 very material difference in the genius of the two systems.
It is much to be regretted that such imperfect monuments remain
 of this curious political fabric. Could its interior structure and
 regular operation be ascertained, it is probable that more light
 would be thrown by it on the science of federal government, than by
 any of the like experiments with which we are acquainted.
One important fact seems to be witnessed by all the historians
 who take notice of Achaean affairs. It is, that as well after the
 renovation of the league by Aratus, as before its dissolution by the
 arts of Macedon, there was infinitely more of moderation and justice
 in the administration of its government, and less of violence and
 sedition in the people, than were to be found in any of the cities
 exercising SINGLY all the prerogatives of sovereignty. The Abbe
 Mably, in his observations on Greece, says that the popular
 government, which was so tempestuous elsewhere, caused no disorders
 in the members of the Achaean republic, BECAUSE IT WAS THERE
 TEMPERED BY THE GENERAL AUTHORITY AND LAWS OF THE CONFEDERACY.
We are not to conclude too hastily, however, that faction did
 not, in a certain degree, agitate the particular cities; much less
 that a due subordination and harmony reigned in the general system.
 The contrary is sufficiently displayed in the vicissitudes and fate
 of the republic.
Whilst the Amphictyonic confederacy remained, that of the
 Achaeans, which comprehended the less important cities only, made
 little figure on the theatre of Greece. When the former became a
 victim to Macedon, the latter was spared by the policy of Philip and
 Alexander. Under the successors of these princes, however, a
 different policy prevailed. The arts of division were practiced
 among the Achaeans. Each city was seduced into a separate interest;
 the union was dissolved. Some of the cities fell under the tyranny
 of Macedonian garrisons; others under that of usurpers springing
 out of their own confusions. Shame and oppression erelong awaken
 their love of liberty. A few cities reunited. Their example was
 followed by others, as opportunities were found of cutting off their
 tyrants. The league soon embraced almost the whole Peloponnesus.
 Macedon saw its progress; but was hindered by internal dissensions
 from stopping it. All Greece caught the enthusiasm and seemed ready
 to unite in one confederacy, when the jealousy and envy in Sparta
 and Athens, of the rising glory of the Achaeans, threw a fatal damp
 on the enterprise. The dread of the Macedonian power induced the
 league to court the alliance of the Kings of Egypt and Syria, who,
 as successors of Alexander, were rivals of the king of Macedon.
 This policy was defeated by Cleomenes, king of Sparta, who was led
 by his ambition to make an unprovoked attack on his neighbors, the
 Achaeans, and who, as an enemy to Macedon, had interest enough with
 the Egyptian and Syrian princes to effect a breach of their
 engagements with the league.
The Achaeans were now reduced to the dilemma of submitting to
 Cleomenes, or of supplicating the aid of Macedon, its former
 oppressor. The latter expedient was adopted. The contests of the
 Greeks always afforded a pleasing opportunity to that powerful
 neighbor of intermeddling in their affairs. A Macedonian army
 quickly appeared. Cleomenes was vanquished. The Achaeans soon
 experienced, as often happens, that a victorious and powerful ally
 is but another name for a master. All that their most abject
 compliances could obtain from him was a toleration of the exercise
 of their laws. Philip, who was now on the throne of Macedon, soon
 provoked by his tyrannies, fresh combinations among the Greeks. The
 Achaeans, though weakenened by internal dissensions and by the
 revolt of Messene, one of its members, being joined by the AEtolians
 and Athenians, erected the standard of opposition. Finding
 themselves, though thus supported, unequal to the undertaking, they
 once more had recourse to the dangerous expedient of introducing the
 succor of foreign arms. The Romans, to whom the invitation was
 made, eagerly embraced it. Philip was conquered; Macedon subdued.
 A new crisis ensued to the league. Dissensions broke out among it
 members. These the Romans fostered. Callicrates and other popular
 leaders became mercenary instruments for inveigling their countrymen. 
 The more effectually to nourish discord and disorder the Romans
 had, to the astonishment of those who confided in their sincerity,
 already proclaimed universal liberty1 throughout Greece. With
 the same insidious views, they now seduced the members from the
 league, by representing to their pride the violation it committed on
 their sovereignty. By these arts this union, the last hope of
 Greece, the last hope of ancient liberty, was torn into pieces; and
 such imbecility and distraction introduced, that the arms of Rome
 found little difficulty in completing the ruin which their arts had
 commenced. The Achaeans were cut to pieces, and Achaia loaded with
 chains, under which it is groaning at this hour.
I have thought it not superfluous to give the outlines of this
 important portion of history; both because it teaches more than one
 lesson, and because, as a supplement to the outlines of the Achaean
 constitution, it emphatically illustrates the tendency of federal
 bodies rather to anarchy among the members, than to tyranny in the
 head.

 Union)
For the Independent Journal.

HAMILTON AND MADISON

To the People of the State of New York:
THE examples of ancient confederacies, cited in my last paper,
 have not exhausted the source of experimental instruction on this
 subject. There are existing institutions, founded on a similar
 principle, which merit particular consideration. The first which
 presents itself is the Germanic body.
In the early ages of Christianity, Germany was occupied by seven
 distinct nations, who had no common chief. The Franks, one of the
 number, having conquered the Gauls, established the kingdom which
 has taken its name from them. In the ninth century Charlemagne, its
 warlike monarch, carried his victorious arms in every direction;
 and Germany became a part of his vast dominions. On the
 dismemberment, which took place under his sons, this part was
 erected into a separate and independent empire. Charlemagne and his
 immediate descendants possessed the reality, as well as the ensigns
 and dignity of imperial power. But the principal vassals, whose
 fiefs had become hereditary, and who composed the national diets
 which Charlemagne had not abolished, gradually threw off the yoke
 and advanced to sovereign jurisdiction and independence. The force
 of imperial sovereignty was insufficient to restrain such powerful
 dependants; or to preserve the unity and tranquillity of the empire. 
 The most furious private wars, accompanied with every species of
 calamity, were carried on between the different princes and states.
 The imperial authority, unable to maintain the public order,
 declined by degrees till it was almost extinct in the anarchy, which
 agitated the long interval between the death of the last emperor of
 the Suabian, and the accession of the first emperor of the Austrian
 lines. In the eleventh century the emperors enjoyed full
 sovereignty: In the fifteenth they had little more than the symbols
 and decorations of power.
Out of this feudal system, which has itself many of the
 important features of a confederacy, has grown the federal system
 which constitutes the Germanic empire. Its powers are vested in a
 diet representing the component members of the confederacy; in the
 emperor, who is the executive magistrate, with a negative on the
 decrees of the diet; and in the imperial chamber and the aulic
 council, two judiciary tribunals having supreme jurisdiction in
 controversies which concern the empire, or which happen among its
 members.
The diet possesses the general power of legislating for the
 empire; of making war and peace; contracting alliances; assessing
 quotas of troops and money; constructing fortresses; regulating
 coin; admitting new members; and subjecting disobedient members to
 the ban of the empire, by which the party is degraded from his
 sovereign rights and his possessions forfeited. The members of the
 confederacy are expressly restricted from entering into compacts
 prejudicial to the empire; from imposing tolls and duties on their
 mutual intercourse, without the consent of the emperor and diet;
 from altering the value of money; from doing injustice to one
 another; or from affording assistance or retreat to disturbers of
 the public peace. And the ban is denounced against such as shall
 violate any of these restrictions. The members of the diet, as
 such, are subject in all cases to be judged by the emperor and diet,
 and in their private capacities by the aulic council and imperial
 chamber.
The prerogatives of the emperor are numerous. The most
 important of them are: his exclusive right to make propositions to
 the diet; to negative its resolutions; to name ambassadors; to
 confer dignities and titles; to fill vacant electorates; to found
 universities; to grant privileges not injurious to the states of
 the empire; to receive and apply the public revenues; and
 generally to watch over the public safety. In certain cases, the
 electors form a council to him. In quality of emperor, he possesses
 no territory within the empire, nor receives any revenue for his
 support. But his revenue and dominions, in other qualities,
 constitute him one of the most powerful princes in Europe.
From such a parade of constitutional powers, in the
 representatives and head of this confederacy, the natural
 supposition would be, that it must form an exception to the general
 character which belongs to its kindred systems. Nothing would be
 further from the reality. The fundamental principle on which it
 rests, that the empire is a community of sovereigns, that the diet
 is a representation of sovereigns and that the laws are addressed to
 sovereigns, renders the empire a nerveless body, incapable of
 regulating its own members, insecure against external dangers, and
 agitated with unceasing fermentations in its own bowels.
The history of Germany is a history of wars between the emperor
 and the princes and states; of wars among the princes and states
 themselves; of the licentiousness of the strong, and the oppression
 of the weak; of foreign intrusions, and foreign intrigues; of
 requisitions of men and money disregarded, or partially complied
 with; of attempts to enforce them, altogether abortive, or attended
 with slaughter and desolation, involving the innocent with the
 guilty; of general inbecility, confusion, and misery.
In the sixteenth century, the emperor, with one part of the
 empire on his side, was seen engaged against the other princes and
 states. In one of the conflicts, the emperor himself was put to
 flight, and very near being made prisoner by the elector of Saxony.
 The late king of Prussia was more than once pitted against his
 imperial sovereign; and commonly proved an overmatch for him.
 Controversies and wars among the members themselves have been so
 common, that the German annals are crowded with the bloody pages
 which describe them. Previous to the peace of Westphalia, Germany
 was desolated by a war of thirty years, in which the emperor, with
 one half of the empire, was on one side, and Sweden, with the other
 half, on the opposite side. Peace was at length negotiated, and
 dictated by foreign powers; and the articles of it, to which
 foreign powers are parties, made a fundamental part of the Germanic
 constitution.
If the nation happens, on any emergency, to be more united by
 the necessity of self-defense, its situation is still deplorable.
 Military preparations must be preceded by so many tedious
 discussions, arising from the jealousies, pride, separate views, and
 clashing pretensions of sovereign bodies, that before the diet can
 settle the arrangements, the enemy are in the field; and before the
 federal troops are ready to take it, are retiring into winter
 quarters.
The small body of national troops, which has been judged
 necessary in time of peace, is defectively kept up, badly paid,
 infected with local prejudices, and supported by irregular and
 disproportionate contributions to the treasury.
The impossibility of maintaining order and dispensing justice
 among these sovereign subjects, produced the experiment of dividing
 the empire into nine or ten circles or districts; of giving them an
 interior organization, and of charging them with the military
 execution of the laws against delinquent and contumacious members.
 This experiment has only served to demonstrate more fully the
 radical vice of the constitution. Each circle is the miniature
 picture of the deformities of this political monster. They either
 fail to execute their commissions, or they do it with all the
 devastation and carnage of civil war. Sometimes whole circles are
 defaulters; and then they increase the mischief which they were
 instituted to remedy.
We may form some judgment of this scheme of military coercion
 from a sample given by Thuanus. In Donawerth, a free and imperial
 city of the circle of Suabia, the Abb 300 de St. Croix enjoyed
 certain immunities which had been reserved to him. In the exercise
 of these, on some public occasions, outrages were committed on him
 by the people of the city. The consequence was that the city was
 put under the ban of the empire, and the Duke of Bavaria, though
 director of another circle, obtained an appointment to enforce it.
 He soon appeared before the city with a corps of ten thousand
 troops, and finding it a fit occasion, as he had secretly intended
 from the beginning, to revive an antiquated claim, on the pretext
 that his ancestors had suffered the place to be dismembered from his
 territory,1 he took possession of it in his own name, disarmed,
 and punished the inhabitants, and reannexed the city to his domains.
It may be asked, perhaps, what has so long kept this disjointed
 machine from falling entirely to pieces? The answer is obvious:
 The weakness of most of the members, who are unwilling to expose
 themselves to the mercy of foreign powers; the weakness of most of
 the principal members, compared with the formidable powers all
 around them; the vast weight and influence which the emperor
 derives from his separate and heriditary dominions; and the
 interest he feels in preserving a system with which his family pride
 is connected, and which constitutes him the first prince in Europe;
 --these causes support a feeble and precarious Union; whilst the
 repellant quality, incident to the nature of sovereignty, and which
 time continually strengthens, prevents any reform whatever, founded
 on a proper consolidation. Nor is it to be imagined, if this
 obstacle could be surmounted, that the neighboring powers would
 suffer a revolution to take place which would give to the empire the
 force and preeminence to which it is entitled. Foreign nations have
 long considered themselves as interested in the changes made by
 events in this constitution; and have, on various occasions,
 betrayed their policy of perpetuating its anarchy and weakness.
If more direct examples were wanting, Poland, as a government
 over local sovereigns, might not improperly be taken notice of. Nor
 could any proof more striking be given of the calamities flowing
 from such institutions. Equally unfit for self-government and
 self-defense, it has long been at the mercy of its powerful
 neighbors; who have lately had the mercy to disburden it of one
 third of its people and territories.
The connection among the Swiss cantons scarcely amounts to a
 confederacy; though it is sometimes cited as an instance of the
 stability of such institutions.
They have no common treasury; no common troops even in war; no
 common coin; no common judicatory; nor any other common mark of
 sovereignty.
They are kept together by the peculiarity of their topographical
 position; by their individual weakness and insignificancy; by the
 fear of powerful neighbors, to one of which they were formerly
 subject; by the few sources of contention among a people of such
 simple and homogeneous manners; by their joint interest in their
 dependent possessions; by the mutual aid they stand in need of, for
 suppressing insurrections and rebellions, an aid expressly
 stipulated and often required and afforded; and by the necessity of
 some regular and permanent provision for accomodating disputes among
 the cantons. The provision is, that the parties at variance shall
 each choose four judges out of the neutral cantons, who, in case of
 disagreement, choose an umpire. This tribunal, under an oath of
 impartiality, pronounces definitive sentence, which all the cantons
 are bound to enforce. The competency of this regulation may be
 estimated by a clause in their treaty of 1683, with Victor Amadeus
 of Savoy; in which he obliges himself to interpose as mediator in
 disputes between the cantons, and to employ force, if necessary,
 against the contumacious party.
So far as the peculiarity of their case will admit of comparison
 with that of the United States, it serves to confirm the principle
 intended to be established. Whatever efficacy the union may have
 had in ordinary cases, it appears that the moment a cause of
 difference sprang up, capable of trying its strength, it failed.
 The controversies on the subject of religion, which in three
 instances have kindled violent and bloody contests, may be said, in
 fact, to have severed the league. The Protestant and Catholic
 cantons have since had their separate diets, where all the most
 important concerns are adjusted, and which have left the general
 diet little other business than to take care of the common bailages.
That separation had another consequence, which merits attention.
 It produced opposite alliances with foreign powers: of Berne, at
 the head of the Protestant association, with the United Provinces;
 and of Luzerne, at the head of the Catholic association, with
 France.

The Same Subject Continued
(The Insufficiency fo the Present Confederation to Preserve the
 Union)
From the New York Packet.
Tuesday, December 11, 1787.

HAMILTON AND MADISON

To the People of the State of New York:
THE United Netherlands are a confederacy of republics, or rather
 of aristocracies of a very remarkable texture, yet confirming all
 the lessons derived from those which we have already reviewed.
The union is composed of seven coequal and sovereign states, and
 each state or province is a composition of equal and independent
 cities. In all important cases, not only the provinces but the
 cities must be unanimous.
The sovereignty of the Union is represented by the
 States-General, consisting usually of about fifty deputies appointed
 by the provinces. They hold their seats, some for life, some for
 six, three, and one years; from two provinces they continue in
 appointment during pleasure.
The States-General have authority to enter into treaties and
 alliances; to make war and peace; to raise armies and equip
 fleets; to ascertain quotas and demand contributions. In all these
 cases, however, unanimity and the sanction of their constituents are
 requisite. They have authority to appoint and receive ambassadors;
 to execute treaties and alliances already formed; to provide for
 the collection of duties on imports and exports; to regulate the
 mint, with a saving to the provincial rights; to govern as
 sovereigns the dependent territories. The provinces are restrained,
 unless with the general consent, from entering into foreign
 treaties; from establishing imposts injurious to others, or
 charging their neighbors with higher duties than their own subjects.
 A council of state, a chamber of accounts, with five colleges of
 admiralty, aid and fortify the federal administration.
The executive magistrate of the union is the stadtholder, who is
 now an hereditary prince. His principal weight and influence in the
 republic are derived from this independent title; from his great
 patrimonial estates; from his family connections with some of the
 chief potentates of Europe; and, more than all, perhaps, from his
 being stadtholder in the several provinces, as well as for the
 union; in which provincial quality he has the appointment of town
 magistrates under certain regulations, executes provincial decrees,
 presides when he pleases in the provincial tribunals, and has
 throughout the power of pardon.
As stadtholder of the union, he has, however, considerable
 prerogatives.
In his political capacity he has authority to settle disputes
 between the provinces, when other methods fail; to assist at the
 deliberations of the States-General, and at their particular
 conferences; to give audiences to foreign ambassadors, and to keep
 agents for his particular affairs at foreign courts.
In his military capacity he commands the federal troops,
 provides for garrisons, and in general regulates military affairs;
 disposes of all appointments, from colonels to ensigns, and of the
 governments and posts of fortified towns.
In his marine capacity he is admiral-general, and superintends
 and directs every thing relative to naval forces and other naval
 affairs; presides in the admiralties in person or by proxy;
 appoints lieutenant-admirals and other officers; and establishes
 councils of war, whose sentences are not executed till he approves
 them.
His revenue, exclusive of his private income, amounts to three
 hundred thousand florins. The standing army which he commands
 consists of about forty thousand men.
Such is the nature of the celebrated Belgic confederacy, as
 delineated on parchment. What are the characters which practice has
 stamped upon it? Imbecility in the government; discord among the
 provinces; foreign influence and indignities; a precarious
 existence in peace, and peculiar calamities from war.
It was long ago remarked by Grotius, that nothing but the hatred
 of his countrymen to the house of Austria kept them from being
 ruined by the vices of their constitution.
The union of Utrecht, says another respectable writer, reposes
 an authority in the States-General, seemingly sufficient to secure
 harmony, but the jealousy in each province renders the practice very
 different from the theory.
The same instrument, says another, obliges each province to levy
 certain contributions; but this article never could, and probably
 never will, be executed; because the inland provinces, who have
 little commerce, cannot pay an equal quota.
In matters of contribution, it is the practice to waive the
 articles of the constitution. The danger of delay obliges the
 consenting provinces to furnish their quotas, without waiting for
 the others; and then to obtain reimbursement from the others, by
 deputations, which are frequent, or otherwise, as they can. The
 great wealth and influence of the province of Holland enable her to
 effect both these purposes.
It has more than once happened, that the deficiencies had to be
 ultimately collected at the point of the bayonet; a thing
 practicable, though dreadful, in a confedracy where one of the
 members exceeds in force all the rest, and where several of them are
 too small to meditate resistance; but utterly impracticable in one
 composed of members, several of which are equal to each other in
 strength and resources, and equal singly to a vigorous and
 persevering defense.
Foreign ministers, says Sir William Temple, who was himself a
 foreign minister, elude matters taken ad referendum, by
 tampering with the provinces and cities. In 1726, the treaty of
 Hanover was delayed by these means a whole year. Instances of a
 like nature are numerous and notorious.
In critical emergencies, the States-General are often compelled
 to overleap their constitutional bounds. In 1688, they concluded a
 treaty of themselves at the risk of their heads. The treaty of
 Westphalia, in 1648, by which their independence was formerly and
 finally recognized, was concluded without the consent of Zealand.
 Even as recently as the last treaty of peace with Great Britain,
 the constitutional principle of unanimity was departed from. A weak
 constitution must necessarily terminate in dissolution, for want of
 proper powers, or the usurpation of powers requisite for the public
 safety. Whether the usurpation, when once begun, will stop at the
 salutary point, or go forward to the dangerous extreme, must depend
 on the contingencies of the moment. Tyranny has perhaps oftener
 grown out of the assumptions of power, called for, on pressing
 exigencies, by a defective constitution, than out of the full
 exercise of the largest constitutional authorities.
Notwithstanding the calamities produced by the stadtholdership,
 it has been supposed that without his influence in the individual
 provinces, the causes of anarchy manifest in the confederacy would
 long ago have dissolved it. ``Under such a government,'' says the
 Abbe Mably, ``the Union could never have subsisted, if the provinces
 had not a spring within themselves, capable of quickening their
 tardiness, and compelling them to the same way of thinking. This
 spring is the stadtholder.'' It is remarked by Sir William Temple,
 ``that in the intermissions of the stadtholdership, Holland, by her
 riches and her authority, which drew the others into a sort of
 dependence, supplied the place.''
These are not the only circumstances which have controlled the
 tendency to anarchy and dissolution. The surrounding powers impose
 an absolute necessity of union to a certain degree, at the same time
 that they nourish by their intrigues the constitutional vices which
 keep the republic in some degree always at their mercy.
The true patriots have long bewailed the fatal tendency of these
 vices, and have made no less than four regular experiments by
 EXTRAORDINARY ASSEMBLIES, convened for the special purpose, to apply
 a remedy. As many times has their laudable zeal found it impossible
 to UNITE THE PUBLIC COUNCILS in reforming the known, the
 acknowledged, the fatal evils of the existing constitution. Let us
 pause, my fellow-citizens, for one moment, over this melancholy and
 monitory lesson of history; and with the tear that drops for the
 calamities brought on mankind by their adverse opinions and selfish
 passions, let our gratitude mingle an ejaculation to Heaven, for the
 propitious concord which has distinguished the consultations for our
 political happiness.
A design was also conceived of establishing a general tax to be
 administered by the federal authority. This also had its
 adversaries and failed.
This unhappy people seem to be now suffering from popular
 convulsions, from dissensions among the states, and from the actual
 invasion of foreign arms, the crisis of their distiny. All nations
 have their eyes fixed on the awful spectacle. The first wish
 prompted by humanity is, that this severe trial may issue in such a
 revolution of their government as will establish their union, and
 render it the parent of tranquillity, freedom and happiness: The
 next, that the asylum under which, we trust, the enjoyment of these
 blessings will speedily be secured in this country, may receive and
 console them for the catastrophe of their own.
I make no apology for having dwelt so long on the contemplation
 of these federal precedents. Experience is the oracle of truth;
 and where its responses are unequivocal, they ought to be
 conclusive and sacred. The important truth, which it unequivocally
 pronounces in the present case, is that a sovereignty over
 sovereigns, a government over governments, a legislation for
 communities, as contradistinguished from individuals, as it is a
 solecism in theory, so in practice it is subversive of the order and
 ends of civil polity, by substituting VIOLENCE in place of LAW, or
 the destructive COERCION of the SWORD in place of the mild and
 salutary COERCION of the MAGISTRACY.
PUBLIUS.


FEDERALIST No. 21

Other Defects of the Present Confederation
For the Independent Journal.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
HAVING in the three last numbers taken a summary review of the
 principal circumstances and events which have depicted the genius
 and fate of other confederate governments, I shall now proceed in
 the enumeration of the most important of those defects which have
 hitherto disappointed our hopes from the system established among
 ourselves. To form a safe and satisfactory judgment of the proper
 remedy, it is absolutely necessary that we should be well acquainted
 with the extent and malignity of the disease.
The next most palpable defect of the subsisting Confederation,
 is the total want of a SANCTION to its laws. The United States, as
 now composed, have no powers to exact obedience, or punish
 disobedience to their resolutions, either by pecuniary mulcts, by a
 suspension or divestiture of privileges, or by any other
 constitutional mode. There is no express delegation of authority to
 them to use force against delinquent members; and if such a right
 should be ascribed to the federal head, as resulting from the nature
 of the social compact between the States, it must be by inference
 and construction, in the face of that part of the second article, by
 which it is declared, ``that each State shall retain every power,
 jurisdiction, and right, not EXPRESSLY delegated to the United
 States in Congress assembled.'' There is, doubtless, a striking
 absurdity in supposing that a right of this kind does not exist, but
 we are reduced to the dilemma either of embracing that supposition,
 preposterous as it may seem, or of contravening or explaining away a
 provision, which has been of late a repeated theme of the eulogies
 of those who oppose the new Constitution; and the want of which, in
 that plan, has been the subject of much plausible animadversion, and
 severe criticism. If we are unwilling to impair the force of this
 applauded provision, we shall be obliged to conclude, that the
 United States afford the extraordinary spectacle of a government
 destitute even of the shadow of constitutional power to enforce the
 execution of its own laws. It will appear, from the specimens which
 have been cited, that the American Confederacy, in this particular,
 stands discriminated from every other institution of a similar kind,
 and exhibits a new and unexampled phenomenon in the political world.
The want of a mutual guaranty of the State governments is
 another capital imperfection in the federal plan. There is nothing
 of this kind declared in the articles that compose it; and to imply
 a tacit guaranty from considerations of utility, would be a still
 more flagrant departure from the clause which has been mentioned,
 than to imply a tacit power of coercion from the like considerations
. The want of a guaranty, though it might in its consequences
 endanger the Union, does not so immediately attack its existence as
 the want of a constitutional sanction to its laws.
Without a guaranty the assistance to be derived from the Union
 in repelling those domestic dangers which may sometimes threaten the
 existence of the State constitutions, must be renounced. Usurpation
 may rear its crest in each State, and trample upon the liberties of
 the people, while the national government could legally do nothing
 more than behold its encroachments with indignation and regret. A
 successful faction may erect a tyranny on the ruins of order and
 law, while no succor could constitutionally be afforded by the Union
 to the friends and supporters of the government. The tempestuous
 situation from which Massachusetts has scarcely emerged, evinces
 that dangers of this kind are not merely speculative. Who can
 determine what might have been the issue of her late convulsions, if
 the malcontents had been headed by a Caesar or by a Cromwell? Who
 can predict what effect a despotism, established in Massachusetts,
 would have upon the liberties of New Hampshire or Rhode Island, of
 Connecticut or New York?
The inordinate pride of State importance has suggested to some
 minds an objection to the principle of a guaranty in the federal
 government, as involving an officious interference in the domestic
 concerns of the members. A scruple of this kind would deprive us of
 one of the principal advantages to be expected from union, and can
 only flow from a misapprehension of the nature of the provision
 itself. It could be no impediment to reforms of the State
 constitution by a majority of the people in a legal and peaceable
 mode. This right would remain undiminished. The guaranty could
 only operate against changes to be effected by violence. Towards
 the preventions of calamities of this kind, too many checks cannot
 be provided. The peace of society and the stability of government
 depend absolutely on the efficacy of the precautions adopted on this
 head. Where the whole power of the government is in the hands of
 the people, there is the less pretense for the use of violent
 remedies in partial or occasional distempers of the State. The
 natural cure for an ill-administration, in a popular or
 representative constitution, is a change of men. A guaranty by the
 national authority would be as much levelled against the usurpations
 of rulers as against the ferments and outrages of faction and
 sedition in the community.
The principle of regulating the contributions of the States to
 the common treasury by QUOTAS is another fundamental error in the
 Confederation. Its repugnancy to an adequate supply of the national
 exigencies has been already pointed out, and has sufficiently
 appeared from the trial which has been made of it. I speak of it
 now solely with a view to equality among the States. Those who have
 been accustomed to contemplate the circumstances which produce and
 constitute national wealth, must be satisfied that there is no
 common standard or barometer by which the degrees of it can be
 ascertained. Neither the value of lands, nor the numbers of the
 people, which have been successively proposed as the rule of State
 contributions, has any pretension to being a just representative.
 If we compare the wealth of the United Netherlands with that of
 Russia or Germany, or even of France, and if we at the same time
 compare the total value of the lands and the aggregate population of
 that contracted district with the total value of the lands and the
 aggregate population of the immense regions of either of the three
 last-mentioned countries, we shall at once discover that there is no
 comparison between the proportion of either of these two objects and
 that of the relative wealth of those nations. If the like parallel
 were to be run between several of the American States, it would
 furnish a like result. Let Virginia be contrasted with North
 Carolina, Pennsylvania with Connecticut, or Maryland with New
 Jersey, and we shall be convinced that the respective abilities of
 those States, in relation to revenue, bear little or no analogy to
 their comparative stock in lands or to their comparative population.
 The position may be equally illustrated by a similar process
 between the counties of the same State. No man who is acquainted
 with the State of New York will doubt that the active wealth of
 King's County bears a much greater proportion to that of Montgomery
 than it would appear to be if we should take either the total value
 of the lands or the total number of the people as a criterion!
The wealth of nations depends upon an infinite variety of causes.
 Situation, soil, climate, the nature of the productions, the
 nature of the government, the genius of the citizens, the degree of
 information they possess, the state of commerce, of arts, of
 industry, these circumstances and many more, too complex, minute, or
 adventitious to admit of a particular specification, occasion
 differences hardly conceivable in the relative opulence and riches
 of different countries. The consequence clearly is that there can
 be no common measure of national wealth, and, of course, no general
 or stationary rule by which the ability of a state to pay taxes can
 be determined. The attempt, therefore, to regulate the
 contributions of the members of a confederacy by any such rule,
 cannot fail to be productive of glaring inequality and extreme
 oppression.
This inequality would of itself be sufficient in America to work
 the eventual destruction of the Union, if any mode of enforcing a
 compliance with its requisitions could be devised. The suffering
 States would not long consent to remain associated upon a principle
 which distributes the public burdens with so unequal a hand, and
 which was calculated to impoverish and oppress the citizens of some
 States, while those of others would scarcely be conscious of the
 small proportion of the weight they were required to sustain. This,
 however, is an evil inseparable from the principle of quotas and
 requisitions.
There is no method of steering clear of this inconvenience, but
 by authorizing the national government to raise its own revenues in
 its own way. Imposts, excises, and, in general, all duties upon
 articles of consumption, may be compared to a fluid, which will, in
 time, find its level with the means of paying them. The amount to
 be contributed by each citizen will in a degree be at his own
 option, and can be regulated by an attention to his resources. The
 rich may be extravagant, the poor can be frugal; and private
 oppression may always be avoided by a judicious selection of objects
 proper for such impositions. If inequalities should arise in some
 States from duties on particular objects, these will, in all
 probability, be counterbalanced by proportional inequalities in
 other States, from the duties on other objects. In the course of
 time and things, an equilibrium, as far as it is attainable in so
 complicated a subject, will be established everywhere. Or, if
 inequalities should still exist, they would neither be so great in
 their degree, so uniform in their operation, nor so odious in their
 appearance, as those which would necessarily spring from quotas,
 upon any scale that can possibly be devised.
It is a signal advantage of taxes on articles of consumption,
 that they contain in their own nature a security against excess.
 They prescribe their own limit; which cannot be exceeded without
 defeating the end proposed, that is, an extension of the revenue.
 When applied to this object, the saying is as just as it is witty,
 that, ``in political arithmetic, two and two do not always make four
.'' If duties are too high, they lessen the consumption; the
 collection is eluded; and the product to the treasury is not so
 great as when they are confined within proper and moderate bounds.
 This forms a complete barrier against any material oppression of
 the citizens by taxes of this class, and is itself a natural
 limitation of the power of imposing them.
Impositions of this kind usually fall under the denomination of
 indirect taxes, and must for a long time constitute the chief part
 of the revenue raised in this country. Those of the direct kind,
 which principally relate to land and buildings, may admit of a rule
 of apportionment. Either the value of land, or the number of the
 people, may serve as a standard. The state of agriculture and the
 populousness of a country have been considered as nearly connected
 with each other. And, as a rule, for the purpose intended, numbers,
 in the view of simplicity and certainty, are entitled to a
 preference. In every country it is a herculean task to obtain a
 valuation of the land; in a country imperfectly settled and
 progressive in improvement, the difficulties are increased almost to
 impracticability. The expense of an accurate valuation is, in all
 situations, a formidable objection. In a branch of taxation where
 no limits to the discretion of the government are to be found in the
 nature of things, the establishment of a fixed rule, not
 incompatible with the end, may be attended with fewer inconveniences
 than to leave that discretion altogether at large.

FEDERALIST No. 22

The Same Subject Continued
(Other Defects of the Present Confederation)
From the New York Packet.
Friday, December 14, 1787.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
IN ADDITION to the defects already enumerated in the existing
 federal system, there are others of not less importance, which
 concur in rendering it altogether unfit for the administration of
 the affairs of the Union.
The want of a power to regulate commerce is by all parties
 allowed to be of the number. The utility of such a power has been
 anticipated under the first head of our inquiries; and for this
 reason, as well as from the universal conviction entertained upon
 the subject, little need be added in this place. It is indeed
 evident, on the most superficial view, that there is no object,
 either as it respects the interests of trade or finance, that more
 strongly demands a federal superintendence. The want of it has
 already operated as a bar to the formation of beneficial treaties
 with foreign powers, and has given occasions of dissatisfaction
 between the States. No nation acquainted with the nature of our
 political association would be unwise enough to enter into
 stipulations with the United States, by which they conceded
 privileges of any importance to them, while they were apprised that
 the engagements on the part of the Union might at any moment be
 violated by its members, and while they found from experience that
 they might enjoy every advantage they desired in our markets,
 without granting us any return but such as their momentary
 convenience might suggest. It is not, therefore, to be wondered at
 that Mr. Jenkinson, in ushering into the House of Commons a bill for
 regulating the temporary intercourse between the two countries,
 should preface its introduction by a declaration that similar
 provisions in former bills had been found to answer every purpose to
 the commerce of Great Britain, and that it would be prudent to
 persist in the plan until it should appear whether the American
 government was likely or not to acquire greater consistency. [1]
Several States have endeavored, by separate prohibitions,
 restrictions, and exclusions, to influence the conduct of that
 kingdom in this particular, but the want of concert, arising from
 the want of a general authority and from clashing and dissimilar
 views in the State, has hitherto frustrated every experiment of the
 kind, and will continue to do so as long as the same obstacles to a
 uniformity of measures continue to exist.
The interfering and unneighborly regulations of some States,
 contrary to the true spirit of the Union, have, in different
 instances, given just cause of umbrage and complaint to others, and
 it is to be feared that examples of this nature, if not restrained
 by a national control, would be multiplied and extended till they
 became not less serious sources of animosity and discord than
 injurious impediments to the intcrcourse between the different parts
 of the Confederacy. ``The commerce of the German empire [2] is in
 continual trammels from the multiplicity of the duties which the
 several princes and states exact upon the merchandises passing
 through their territories, by means of which the fine streams and
 navigable rivers with which Germany is so happily watered are
 rendered almost useless.'' Though the genius of the people of this
 country might never permit this description to be strictly
 applicable to us, yet we may reasonably expect, from the gradual
 conflicts of State regulations, that the citizens of each would at
 length come to be considered and treated by the others in no better
 light than that of foreigners and aliens.
The power of raising armies, by the most obvious construction of
 the articles of the Confederation, is merely a power of making
 requisitions upon the States for quotas of men. This practice in
 the course of the late war, was found replete with obstructions to a
 vigorous and to an economical system of defense. It gave birth to a
 competition between the States which created a kind of auction for
 men. In order to furnish the quotas required of them, they outbid
 each other till bounties grew to an enormous and insupportable size.
 The hope of a still further increase afforded an inducement to
 those who were disposed to serve to procrastinate their enlistment,
 and disinclined them from engaging for any considerable periods.
 Hence, slow and scanty levies of men, in the most critical
 emergencies of our affairs; short enlistments at an unparalleled
 expense; continual fluctuations in the troops, ruinous to their
 discipline and subjecting the public safety frequently to the
 perilous crisis of a disbanded army. Hence, also, those oppressive
 expedients for raising men which were upon several occasions
 practiced, and which nothing but the enthusiasm of liberty would
 have induced the people to endure.
This method of raising troops is not more unfriendly to economy
 and vigor than it is to an equal distribution of the burden. The
 States near the seat of war, influenced by motives of
 self-preservation, made efforts to furnish their quotas, which even
 exceeded their abilities; while those at a distance from danger
 were, for the most part, as remiss as the others were diligent, in
 their exertions. The immediate pressure of this inequality was not
 in this case, as in that of the contributions of money, alleviated
 by the hope of a final liquidation. The States which did not pay
 their proportions of money might at least be charged with their
 deficiencies; but no account could be formed of the deficiencies in
 the supplies of men. We shall not, however, see much reason to
 reget the want of this hope, when we consider how little prospect
 there is, that the most delinquent States will ever be able to make
 compensation for their pecuniary failures. The system of quotas and
 requisitions, whether it be applied to men or money, is, in every
 view, a system of imbecility in the Union, and of inequality and
 injustice among the members.
The right of equal suffrage among the States is another
 exceptionable part of the Confederation. Every idea of proportion
 and every rule of fair representation conspire to condemn a
 principle, which gives to Rhode Island an equal weight in the scale
 of power with Massachusetts, or Connecticut, or New York; and to
 Deleware an equal voice in the national deliberations with
 Pennsylvania, or Virginia, or North Carolina. Its operation
 contradicts the fundamental maxim of republican government, which
 requires that the sense of the majority should prevail. Sophistry
 may reply, that sovereigns are equal, and that a majority of the
 votes of the States will be a majority of confederated America. But
 this kind of logical legerdemain will never counteract the plain
 suggestions of justice and common-sense. It may happen that this
 majority of States is a small minority of the people of
 America [3]; and two thirds of the people of America could not
 long be persuaded, upon the credit of artificial distinctions and
 syllogistic subtleties, to submit their interests to the management
 and disposal of one third. The larger States would after a while
 revolt from the idea of receiving the law from the smaller. To
 acquiesce in such a privation of their due importance in the
 political scale, would be not merely to be insensible to the love of
 power, but even to sacrifice the desire of equality. It is neither
 rational to expect the first, nor just to require the last. The
 smaller States, considering how peculiarly their safety and welfare
 depend on union, ought readily to renounce a pretension which, if
 not relinquished, would prove fatal to its duration.
It may be objected to this, that not seven but nine States, or
 two thirds of the whole number, must consent to the most important
 resolutions; and it may be thence inferred that nine States would
 always comprehend a majority of the Union. But this does not
 obviate the impropriety of an equal vote between States of the most
 unequal dimensions and populousness; nor is the inference accurate
 in point of fact; for we can enumerate nine States which contain
 less than a majority of the people [4]; and it is constitutionally
 possible that these nine may give the vote. Besides, there are
 matters of considerable moment determinable by a bare majority; and
 there are others, concerning which doubts have been entertained,
 which, if interpreted in favor of the sufficiency of a vote of seven
 States, would extend its operation to interests of the first
 magnitude. In addition to this, it is to be observed that there is
 a probability of an increase in the number of States, and no
 provision for a proportional augmentation of the ratio of votes.
But this is not all: what at first sight may seem a remedy, is,
 in reality, a poison. To give a minority a negative upon the
 majority (which is always the case where more than a majority is
 requisite to a decision), is, in its tendency, to subject the sense
 of the greater number to that of the lesser. Congress, from the
 nonattendance of a few States, have been frequently in the situation
 of a Polish diet, where a single VOTE has been sufficient to put a
 stop to all their movements. A sixtieth part of the Union, which is
 about the proportion of Delaware and Rhode Island, has several times
 been able to oppose an entire bar to its operations. This is one of
 those refinements which, in practice, has an effect the reverse of
 what is expected from it in theory. The necessity of unanimity in
 public bodies, or of something approaching towards it, has been
 founded upon a supposition that it would contribute to security.
 But its real operation is to embarrass the administration, to
 destroy the energy of the government, and to substitute the
 pleasure, caprice, or artifices of an insignificant, turbulent, or
 corrupt junto, to the regular deliberations and decisions of a
 respectable majority. In those emergencies of a nation, in which
 the goodness or badness, the weakness or strength of its government,
 is of the greatest importance, there is commonly a necessity for
 action. The public business must, in some way or other, go forward.
 If a pertinacious minority can control the opinion of a majority,
 respecting the best mode of conducting it, the majority, in order
 that something may be done, must conform to the views of the
 minority; and thus the sense of the smaller number will overrule
 that of the greater, and give a tone to the national proceedings.
 Hence, tedious delays; continual negotiation and intrigue;
 contemptible compromises of the public good. And yet, in such a
 system, it is even happy when such compromises can take place: for
 upon some occasions things will not admit of accommodation; and
 then the measures of government must be injuriously suspended, or
 fatally defeated. It is often, by the impracticability of obtaining
 the concurrence of the necessary number of votes, kept in a state of
 inaction. Its situation must always savor of weakness, sometimes
 border upon anarchy.
It is not difficult to discover, that a principle of this kind
 gives greater scope to foreign corruption, as well as to domestic
 faction, than that which permits the sense of the majority to
 decide; though the contrary of this has been presumed. The mistake
 has proceeded from not attending with due care to the mischiefs that
 may be occasioned by obstructing the progress of government at
 certain critical seasons. When the concurrence of a large number is
 required by the Constitution to the doing of any national act, we
 are apt to rest satisfied that all is safe, because nothing improper
 will be likely TO BE DONE, but we forget how much good may be
 prevented, and how much ill may be produced, by the power of
 hindering the doing what may be necessary, and of keeping affairs in
 the same unfavorable posture in which they may happen to stand at
 particular periods.
Suppose, for instance, we were engaged in a war, in conjunction
 with one foreign nation, against another. Suppose the necessity of
 our situation demanded peace, and the interest or ambition of our
 ally led him to seek the prosecution of the war, with views that
 might justify us in making separate terms. In such a state of
 things, this ally of ours would evidently find it much easier, by
 his bribes and intrigues, to tie up the hands of government from
 making peace, where two thirds of all the votes were requisite to
 that object, than where a simple majority would suffice. In the
 first case, he would have to corrupt a smaller number; in the last,
 a greater number. Upon the same principle, it would be much easier
 for a foreign power with which we were at war to perplex our
 councils and embarrass our exertions. And, in a commercial view, we
 may be subjected to similar inconveniences. A nation, with which we
 might have a treaty of commerce, could with much greater facility
 prevent our forming a connection with her competitor in trade,
 though such a connection should be ever so beneficial to ourselves.
Evils of this description ought not to be regarded as imaginary.
 One of the weak sides of republics, among their numerous
 advantages, is that they afford too easy an inlet to foreign
 corruption. An hereditary monarch, though often disposed to
 sacrifice his subjects to his ambition, has so great a personal
 interest in the government and in the external glory of the nation,
 that it is not easy for a foreign power to give him an equivalent
 for what he would sacrifice by treachery to the state. The world
 has accordingly been witness to few examples of this species of
 royal prostitution, though there have been abundant specimens of
 every other kind.
In republics, persons elevated from the mass of the community,
 by the suffrages of their fellow-citizens, to stations of great
 pre-eminence and power, may find compensations for betraying their
 trust, which, to any but minds animated and guided by superior
 virtue, may appear to exceed the proportion of interest they have in
 the common stock, and to overbalance the obligations of duty. Hence
 it is that history furnishes us with so many mortifying examples of
 the prevalency of foreign corruption in republican governments. How
 much this contributed to the ruin of the ancient commonwealths has
 been already delineated. It is well known that the deputies of the
 United Provinces have, in various instances, been purchased by the
 emissaries of the neighboring kingdoms. The Earl of Chesterfield
 (if my memory serves me right), in a letter to his court, intimates
 that his success in an important negotiation must depend on his
 obtaining a major's commission for one of those deputies. And in
 Sweden the parties were alternately bought by France and England in
 so barefaced and notorious a manner that it excited universal
 disgust in the nation, and was a principal cause that the most
 limited monarch in Europe, in a single day, without tumult,
 violence, or opposition, became one of the most absolute and
 uncontrolled.
A circumstance which crowns the defects of the Confederation
 remains yet to be mentioned, the want of a judiciary power. Laws
 are a dead letter without courts to expound and define their true
 meaning and operation. The treaties of the United States, to have
 any force at all, must be considered as part of the law of the land.
 Their true import, as far as respects individuals, must, like all
 other laws, be ascertained by judicial determinations. To produce
 uniformity in these determinations, they ought to be submitted, in
 the last resort, to one SUPREME TRIBUNAL. And this tribunal ought
 to be instituted under the same authority which forms the treaties
 themselves. These ingredients are both indispensable. If there is
 in each State a court of final jurisdiction, there may be as many
 different final determinations on the same point as there are courts.
 There are endless diversities in the opinions of men. We often
 see not only different courts but the judges of the came court
 differing from each other. To avoid the confusion which would
 unavoidably result from the contradictory decisions of a number of
 independent judicatories, all nations have found it necessary to
 establish one court paramount to the rest, possessing a general
 superintendence, and authorized to settle and declare in the last
 resort a uniform rule of civil justice.
This is the more necessary where the frame of the government is
 so compounded that the laws of the whole are in danger of being
 contravened by the laws of the parts. In this case, if the
 particular tribunals are invested with a right of ultimate
 jurisdiction, besides the contradictions to be expected from
 difference of opinion, there will be much to fear from the bias of
 local views and prejudices, and from the interference of local
 regulations. As often as such an interference was to happen, there
 would be reason to apprehend that the provisions of the particular
 laws might be preferred to those of the general laws; for nothing
 is more natural to men in office than to look with peculiar
 deference towards that authority to which they owe their official
 existence. The treaties of the United States, under the present
 Constitution, are liable to the infractions of thirteen different
 legislatures, and as many different courts of final jurisdiction,
 acting under the authority of those legislatures. The faith, the
 reputation, the peace of the whole Union, are thus continually at
 the mercy of the prejudices, the passions, and the interests of
 every member of which it is composed. Is it possible that foreign
 nations can either respect or confide in such a government? Is it
 possible that the people of America will longer consent to trust
 their honor, their happiness, their safety, on so precarious a
 foundation?
In this review of the Confederation, I have confined myself to
 the exhibition of its most material defects; passing over those
 imperfections in its details by which even a great part of the power
 intended to be conferred upon it has been in a great measure
 rendered abortive. It must be by this time evident to all men of
 reflection, who can divest themselves of the prepossessions of
 preconceived opinions, that it is a system so radically vicious and
 unsound, as to admit not of amendment but by an entire change in its
 leading features and characters.
The organization of Congress is itself utterly improper for the
 exercise of those powers which are necessary to be deposited in the
 Union. A single assembly may be a proper receptacle of those
 slender, or rather fettered, authorities, which have been heretofore
 delegated to the federal head; but it would be inconsistent with
 all the principles of good government, to intrust it with those
 additional powers which, even the moderate and more rational
 adversaries of the proposed Constitution admit, ought to reside in
 the United States. If that plan should not be adopted, and if the
 necessity of the Union should be able to withstand the ambitious
 aims of those men who may indulge magnificent schemes of personal
 aggrandizement from its dissolution, the probability would be, that
 we should run into the project of conferring supplementary powers
 upon Congress, as they are now constituted; and either the machine,
 from the intrinsic feebleness of its structure, will moulder into
 pieces, in spite of our ill-judged efforts to prop it; or, by
 successive augmentations of its force an energy, as necessity might
 prompt, we shall finally accumulate, in a single body, all the most
 important prerogatives of sovereignty, and thus entail upon our
 posterity one of the most execrable forms of government that human
 infatuation ever contrived. Thus, we should create in reality that
 very tyranny which the adversaries of the new Constitution either
 are, or affect to be, solicitous to avert.
It has not a little contributed to the infirmities of the
 existing federal system, that it never had a ratification by the
 PEOPLE. Resting on no better foundation than the consent of the
 several legislatures, it has been exposed to frequent and intricate
 questions concerning the validity of its powers, and has, in some
 instances, given birth to the enormous doctrine of a right of
 legislative repeal. Owing its ratification to the law of a State,
 it has been contended that the same authority might repeal the law
 by which it was ratified. However gross a heresy it may be to
 maintain that a PARTY to a COMPACT has a right to revoke that
 COMPACT, the doctrine itself has had respectable advocates. The
 possibility of a question of this nature proves the necessity of
 laying the foundations of our national government deeper than in the
 mere sanction of delegated authority. The fabric of American empire
 ought to rest on the solid basis of THE CONSENT OF THE PEOPLE. The
 streams of national power ought to flow immediately from that pure,
 original fountain of all legitimate authority.

FEDERALIST No. 23

The Necessity of a Government as Energetic as the One Proposed to
 the Preservation of the Union
From the New York Packet.
Tuesday, December 18, 1787.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
THE necessity of a Constitution, at least equally energetic with
 the one proposed, to the preservation of the Union, is the point at
 the examination of which we are now arrived.
This inquiry will naturally divide itself into three
 branches the objects to be provided for by the federal government,
 the quantity of power necessary to the accomplishment of those
 objects, the persons upon whom that power ought to operate. Its
 distribution and organization will more properly claim our attention
 under the succeeding head.
The principal purposes to be answered by union are these the
 common defense of the members; the preservation of the public peace
 as well against internal convulsions as external attacks; the
 regulation of commerce with other nations and between the States;
 the superintendence of our intercourse, political and commercial,
 with foreign countries.
The authorities essential to the common defense are these: to
 raise armies; to build and equip fleets; to prescribe rules for
 the government of both; to direct their operations; to provide for
 their support. These powers ought to exist without limitation,
 BECAUSE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FORESEE OR DEFINE THE EXTENT AND VARIETY
 OF NATIONAL EXIGENCIES, OR THE CORRESPONDENT EXTENT AND VARIETY OF
 THE MEANS WHICH MAY BE NECESSARY TO SATISFY THEM. The circumstances
 that endanger the safety of nations are infinite, and for this
 reason no constitutional shackles can wisely be imposed on the power
 to which the care of it is committed. This power ought to be
 coextensive with all the possible combinations of such
 circumstances; and ought to be under the direction of the same
 councils which are appointed to preside over the common defense.
This is one of those truths which, to a correct and unprejudiced
 mind, carries its own evidence along with it; and may be obscured,
 but cannot be made plainer by argument or reasoning. It rests upon
 axioms as simple as they are universal; the MEANS ought to be
 proportioned to the END; the persons, from whose agency the
 attainment of any END is expected, ought to possess the MEANS by
 which it is to be attained.
Whether there ought to be a federal government intrusted with
 the care of the common defense, is a question in the first instance,
 open for discussion; but the moment it is decided in the
 affirmative, it will follow, that that government ought to be
 clothed with all the powers requisite to complete execution of its
 trust. And unless it can be shown that the circumstances which may
 affect the public safety are reducible within certain determinate
 limits; unless the contrary of this position can be fairly and
 rationally disputed, it must be admitted, as a necessary
 consequence, that there can be no limitation of that authority which
 is to provide for the defense and protection of the community, in
 any matter essential to its efficacy that is, in any matter
 essential to the FORMATION, DIRECTION, or SUPPORT of the NATIONAL
 FORCES.
Defective as the present Confederation has been proved to be,
 this principle appears to have been fully recognized by the framers
 of it; though they have not made proper or adequate provision for
 its exercise. Congress have an unlimited discretion to make
 requisitions of men and money; to govern the army and navy; to
 direct their operations. As their requisitions are made
 constitutionally binding upon the States, who are in fact under the
 most solemn obligations to furnish the supplies required of them,
 the intention evidently was that the United States should command
 whatever resources were by them judged requisite to the ``common
 defense and general welfare.'' It was presumed that a sense of
 their true interests, and a regard to the dictates of good faith,
 would be found sufficient pledges for the punctual performance of
 the duty of the members to the federal head.
The experiment has, however, demonstrated that this expectation
 was ill-founded and illusory; and the observations, made under the
 last head, will, I imagine, have sufficed to convince the impartial
 and discerning, that there is an absolute necessity for an entire
 change in the first principles of the system; that if we are in
 earnest about giving the Union energy and duration, we must abandon
 the vain project of legislating upon the States in their collective
 capacities; we must extend the laws of the federal government to
 the individual citizens of America; we must discard the fallacious
 scheme of quotas and requisitions, as equally impracticable and
 unjust. The result from all this is that the Union ought to be
 invested with full power to levy troops; to build and equip fleets;
 and to raise the revenues which will be required for the formation
 and support of an army and navy, in the customary and ordinary modes
 practiced in other governments.
If the circumstances of our country are such as to demand a
 compound instead of a simple, a confederate instead of a sole,
 government, the essential point which will remain to be adjusted
 will be to discriminate the OBJECTS, as far as it can be done, which
 shall appertain to the different provinces or departments of power;
 allowing to each the most ample authority for fulfilling the
 objects committed to its charge. Shall the Union be constituted the
 guardian of the common safety? Are fleets and armies and revenues
 necessary to this purpose? The government of the Union must be
 empowered to pass all laws, and to make all regulations which have
 relation to them. The same must be the case in respect to commerce,
 and to every other matter to which its jurisdiction is permitted to
 extend. Is the administration of justice between the citizens of
 the same State the proper department of the local governments?
 These must possess all the authorities which are connected with
 this object, and with every other that may be allotted to their
 particular cognizance and direction. Not to confer in each case a
 degree of power commensurate to the end, would be to violate the
 most obvious rules of prudence and propriety, and improvidently to
 trust the great interests of the nation to hands which are disabled
 from managing them with vigor and success.
Who is likely to make suitable provisions for the public
 defense, as that body to which the guardianship of the public safety
 is confided; which, as the centre of information, will best
 understand the extent and urgency of the dangers that threaten; as
 the representative of the WHOLE, will feel itself most deeply
 interested in the preservation of every part; which, from the
 responsibility implied in the duty assigned to it, will be most
 sensibly impressed with the necessity of proper exertions; and
 which, by the extension of its authority throughout the States, can
 alone establish uniformity and concert in the plans and measures by
 which the common safety is to be secured? Is there not a manifest
 inconsistency in devolving upon the federal government the care of
 the general defense, and leaving in the State governments the
 EFFECTIVE powers by which it is to be provided for? Is not a want
 of co-operation the infallible consequence of such a system? And
 will not weakness, disorder, an undue distribution of the burdens
 and calamities of war, an unnecessary and intolerable increase of
 expense, be its natural and inevitable concomitants? Have we not
 had unequivocal experience of its effects in the course of the
 revolution which we have just accomplished?
Every view we may take of the subject, as candid inquirers after
 truth, will serve to convince us, that it is both unwise and
 dangerous to deny the federal government an unconfined authority, as
 to all those objects which are intrusted to its management. It will
 indeed deserve the most vigilant and careful attention of the
 people, to see that it be modeled in such a manner as to admit of
 its being safely vested with the requisite powers. If any plan
 which has been, or may be, offered to our consideration, should not,
 upon a dispassionate inspection, be found to answer this
 description, it ought to be rejected. A government, the
 constitution of which renders it unfit to be trusted with all the
 powers which a free people OUGHT TO DELEGATE TO ANY GOVERNMENT,
 would be an unsafe and improper depositary of the NATIONAL INTERESTS.
 Wherever THESE can with propriety be confided, the coincident
 powers may safely accompany them. This is the true result of all
 just reasoning upon the subject. And the adversaries of the plan
 promulgated by the convention ought to have confined themselves to
 showing, that the internal structure of the proposed government was
 such as to render it unworthy of the confidence of the people. They
 ought not to have wandered into inflammatory declamations and
 unmeaning cavils about the extent of the powers. The POWERS are not
 too extensive for the OBJECTS of federal administration, or, in
 other words, for the management of our NATIONAL INTERESTS; nor can
 any satisfactory argument be framed to show that they are chargeable
 with such an excess. If it be true, as has been insinuated by some
 of the writers on the other side, that the difficulty arises from
 the nature of the thing, and that the extent of the country will not
 permit us to form a government in which such ample powers can safely
 be reposed, it would prove that we ought to contract our views, and
 resort to the expedient of separate confederacies, which will move
 within more practicable spheres. For the absurdity must continually
 stare us in the face of confiding to a government the direction of
 the most essential national interests, without daring to trust it to
 the authorities which are indispensible to their proper and
 efficient management. Let us not attempt to reconcile
 contradictions, but firmly embrace a rational alternative.
I trust, however, that the impracticability of one general
 system cannot be shown. I am greatly mistaken, if any thing of
 weight has yet been advanced of this tendency; and I flatter
 myself, that the observations which have been made in the course of
 these papers have served to place the reverse of that position in as
 clear a light as any matter still in the womb of time and experience
 can be susceptible of. This, at all events, must be evident, that
 the very difficulty itself, drawn from the extent of the country, is
 the strongest argument in favor of an energetic government; for any
 other can certainly never preserve the Union of so large an empire.
 If we embrace the tenets of those who oppose the adoption of the
 proposed Constitution, as the standard of our political creed, we
 cannot fail to verify the gloomy doctrines which predict the
 impracticability of a national system pervading entire limits of the
 present Confederacy.

The Powers Necessary to the Common Defense Further Considered
For the Independent Journal.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
To THE powers proposed to be conferred upon the federal
 government, in respect to the creation and direction of the national
 forces, I have met with but one specific objection, which, if I
 understand it right, is this, that proper provision has not been
 made against the existence of standing armies in time of peace; an
 objection which, I shall now endeavor to show, rests on weak and
 unsubstantial foundations.
It has indeed been brought forward in the most vague and general
 form, supported only by bold assertions, without the appearance of
 argument; without even the sanction of theoretical opinions; in
 contradiction to the practice of other free nations, and to the
 general sense of America, as expressed in most of the existing
 constitutions. The proprietory of this remark will appear, the
 moment it is recollected that the objection under consideration
 turns upon a supposed necessity of restraining the LEGISLATIVE
 authority of the nation, in the article of military establishments;
 a principle unheard of, except in one or two of our State
 constitutions, and rejected in all the rest.
A stranger to our politics, who was to read our newspapers at
 the present juncture, without having previously inspected the plan
 reported by the convention, would be naturally led to one of two
 conclusions: either that it contained a positive injunction, that
 standing armies should be kept up in time of peace; or that it
 vested in the EXECUTIVE the whole power of levying troops, without
 subjecting his discretion, in any shape, to the control of the
 legislature.
If he came afterwards to peruse the plan itself, he would be
 surprised to discover, that neither the one nor the other was the
 case; that the whole power of raising armies was lodged in the
 LEGISLATURE, not in the EXECUTIVE; that this legislature was to be
 a popular body, consisting of the representatives of the people
 periodically elected; and that instead of the provision he had
 supposed in favor of standing armies, there was to be found, in
 respect to this object, an important qualification even of the
 legislative discretion, in that clause which forbids the
 appropriation of money for the support of an army for any longer
 period than two years a precaution which, upon a nearer view of it,
 will appear to be a great and real security against the keeping up
 of troops without evident necessity.
Disappointed in his first surmise, the person I have supposed
 would be apt to pursue his conjectures a little further. He would
 naturally say to himself, it is impossible that all this vehement
 and pathetic declamation can be without some colorable pretext. It
 must needs be that this people, so jealous of their liberties, have,
 in all the preceding models of the constitutions which they have
 established, inserted the most precise and rigid precautions on this
 point, the omission of which, in the new plan, has given birth to
 all this apprehension and clamor.
If, under this impression, he proceeded to pass in review the
 several State constitutions, how great would be his disappointment
 to find that TWO ONLY of them [1] contained an interdiction of
 standing armies in time of peace; that the other eleven had either
 observed a profound silence on the subject, or had in express terms
 admitted the right of the Legislature to authorize their existence.
Still, however he would be persuaded that there must be some
 plausible foundation for the cry raised on this head. He would
 never be able to imagine, while any source of information remained
 unexplored, that it was nothing more than an experiment upon the
 public credulity, dictated either by a deliberate intention to
 deceive, or by the overflowings of a zeal too intemperate to be
 ingenuous. It would probably occur to him, that he would be likely
 to find the precautions he was in search of in the primitive compact
 between the States. Here, at length, he would expect to meet with a
 solution of the enigma. No doubt, he would observe to himself, the
 existing Confederation must contain the most explicit provisions
 against military establishments in time of peace; and a departure
 from this model, in a favorite point, has occasioned the discontent
 which appears to influence these political champions.
If he should now apply himself to a careful and critical survey
 of the articles of Confederation, his astonishment would not only be
 increased, but would acquire a mixture of indignation, at the
 unexpected discovery, that these articles, instead of containing the
 prohibition he looked for, and though they had, with jealous
 circumspection, restricted the authority of the State legislatures
 in this particular, had not imposed a single restraint on that of
 the United States. If he happened to be a man of quick sensibility,
 or ardent temper, he could now no longer refrain from regarding
 these clamors as the dishonest artifices of a sinister and
 unprincipled opposition to a plan which ought at least to receive a
 fair and candid examination from all sincere lovers of their
 country! How else, he would say, could the authors of them have
 been tempted to vent such loud censures upon that plan, about a
 point in which it seems to have conformed itself to the general
 sense of America as declared in its different forms of government,
 and in which it has even superadded a new and powerful guard unknown
 to any of them? If, on the contrary, he happened to be a man of
 calm and dispassionate feelings, he would indulge a sigh for the
 frailty of human nature, and would lament, that in a matter so
 interesting to the happiness of millions, the true merits of the
 question should be perplexed and entangled by expedients so
 unfriendly to an impartial and right determination. Even such a man
 could hardly forbear remarking, that a conduct of this kind has too
 much the appearance of an intention to mislead the people by
 alarming their passions, rather than to convince them by arguments
 addressed to their understandings.
But however little this objection may be countenanced, even by
 precedents among ourselves, it may be satisfactory to take a nearer
 view of its intrinsic merits. From a close examination it will
 appear that restraints upon the discretion of the legislature in
 respect to military establishments in time of peace, would be
 improper to be imposed, and if imposed, from the necessities of
 society, would be unlikely to be observed.
Though a wide ocean separates the United States from Europe, yet
 there are various considerations that warn us against an excess of
 confidence or security. On one side of us, and stretching far into
 our rear, are growing settlements subject to the dominion of Britain.
 On the other side, and extending to meet the British settlements,
 are colonies and establishments subject to the dominion of Spain.
 This situation and the vicinity of the West India Islands,
 belonging to these two powers create between them, in respect to
 their American possessions and in relation to us, a common interest.
 The savage tribes on our Western frontier ought to be regarded as
 our natural enemies, their natural allies, because they have most to
 fear from us, and most to hope from them. The improvements in the
 art of navigation have, as to the facility of communication,
 rendered distant nations, in a great measure, neighbors. Britain
 and Spain are among the principal maritime powers of Europe. A
 future concert of views between these nations ought not to be
 regarded as improbable. The increasing remoteness of consanguinity
 is every day diminishing the force of the family compact between
 France and Spain. And politicians have ever with great reason
 considered the ties of blood as feeble and precarious links of
 political connection. These circumstances combined, admonish us not
 to be too sanguine in considering ourselves as entirely out of the
 reach of danger.
Previous to the Revolution, and ever since the peace, there has
 been a constant necessity for keeping small garrisons on our Western
 frontier. No person can doubt that these will continue to be
 indispensable, if it should only be against the ravages and
 depredations of the Indians. These garrisons must either be
 furnished by occasional detachments from the militia, or by
 permanent corps in the pay of the government. The first is
 impracticable; and if practicable, would be pernicious. The
 militia would not long, if at all, submit to be dragged from their
 occupations and families to perform that most disagreeable duty in
 times of profound peace. And if they could be prevailed upon or
 compelled to do it, the increased expense of a frequent rotation of
 service, and the loss of labor and disconcertion of the industrious
 pursuits of individuals, would form conclusive objections to the
 scheme. It would be as burdensome and injurious to the public as
 ruinous to private citizens. The latter resource of permanent corps
 in the pay of the government amounts to a standing army in time of
 peace; a small one, indeed, but not the less real for being small.
 Here is a simple view of the subject, that shows us at once the
 impropriety of a constitutional interdiction of such establishments,
 and the necessity of leaving the matter to the discretion and
 prudence of the legislature.
In proportion to our increase in strength, it is probable, nay,
 it may be said certain, that Britain and Spain would augment their
 military establishments in our neighborhood. If we should not be
 willing to be exposed, in a naked and defenseless condition, to
 their insults and encroachments, we should find it expedient to
 increase our frontier garrisons in some ratio to the force by which
 our Western settlements might be annoyed. There are, and will be,
 particular posts, the possession of which will include the command
 of large districts of territory, and facilitate future invasions of
 the remainder. It may be added that some of those posts will be
 keys to the trade with the Indian nations. Can any man think it
 would be wise to leave such posts in a situation to be at any
 instant seized by one or the other of two neighboring and formidable
 powers? To act this part would be to desert all the usual maxims of
 prudence and policy.
If we mean to be a commercial people, or even to be secure on
 our Atlantic side, we must endeavor, as soon as possible, to have a
 navy. To this purpose there must be dock-yards and arsenals; and
 for the defense of these, fortifications, and probably garrisons.
 When a nation has become so powerful by sea that it can protect its
 dock-yards by its fleets, this supersedes the necessity of garrisons
 for that purpose; but where naval establishments are in their
 infancy, moderate garrisons will, in all likelihood, be found an
 indispensable security against descents for the destruction of the
 arsenals and dock-yards, and sometimes of the fleet itself.
PUBLIUS.
FNA1-@1 This statement of the matter is taken from the printed
 collection of State constitutions. Pennsylvania and North Carolina
 are the two which contain the interdiction in these words: ``As
 standing armies in time of peace are dangerous to liberty, THEY
 OUGHT NOT to be kept up.'' This is, in truth, rather a CAUTION than
 a PROHIBITION. New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Delaware, and Maryland
 have, in each of their bils of rights, a clause to this effect:
 ``Standing armies are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be
 raised or kept up WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE LEGISLATURE''; which
 is a formal admission of the authority of the Legislature. New York
 has no bills of rights, and her constitution says not a word about
 the matter. No bills of rights appear annexed to the constitutions
 of the other States, except the foregoing, and their constitutions
 are equally silent. I am told, however that one or two States have
 bills of rights which do not appear in this collection; but that
 those also recognize the right of the legislative authority in this
 respect.


FEDERALIST No. 25

The Same Subject Continued
(The Powers Necessary to the Common Defense Further Considered)
From the New York Packet.
Friday, December 21, 1787.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
IT MAY perhaps be urged that the objects enumerated in the
 preceding number ought to be provided for by the State governments,
 under the direction of the Union. But this would be, in reality, an
 inversion of the primary principle of our political association, as
 it would in practice transfer the care of the common defense from
 the federal head to the individual members: a project oppressive to
 some States, dangerous to all, and baneful to the Confederacy.
The territories of Britain, Spain, and of the Indian nations in
 our neighborhood do not border on particular States, but encircle
 the Union from Maine to Georgia. The danger, though in different
 degrees, is therefore common. And the means of guarding against it
 ought, in like manner, to be the objects of common councils and of a
 common treasury. It happens that some States, from local situation,
 are more directly exposed. New York is of this class. Upon the
 plan of separate provisions, New York would have to sustain the
 whole weight of the establishments requisite to her immediate
 safety, and to the mediate or ultimate protection of her neighbors.
 This would neither be equitable as it respected New York nor safe
 as it respected the other States. Various inconveniences would
 attend such a system. The States, to whose lot it might fall to
 support the necessary establishments, would be as little able as
 willing, for a considerable time to come, to bear the burden of
 competent provisions. The security of all would thus be subjected
 to the parsimony, improvidence, or inability of a part. If the
 resources of such part becoming more abundant and extensive, its
 provisions should be proportionally enlarged, the other States would
 quickly take the alarm at seeing the whole military force of the
 Union in the hands of two or three of its members, and those
 probably amongst the most powerful. They would each choose to have
 some counterpoise, and pretenses could easily be contrived. In this
 situation, military establishments, nourished by mutual jealousy,
 would be apt to swell beyond their natural or proper size; and
 being at the separate disposal of the members, they would be engines
 for the abridgment or demolition of the national authcrity.
Reasons have been already given to induce a supposition that the
 State governments will too naturally be prone to a rivalship with
 that of the Union, the foundation of which will be the love of
 power; and that in any contest between the federal head and one of
 its members the people will be most apt to unite with their local
 government. If, in addition to this immense advantage, the ambition
 of the members should be stimulated by the separate and independent
 possession of military forces, it would afford too strong a
 temptation and too great a facility to them to make enterprises
 upon, and finally to subvert, the constitutional authority of the
 Union. On the other hand, the liberty of the people would be less
 safe in this state of things than in that which left the national
 forces in the hands of the national government. As far as an army
 may be considered as a dangerous weapon of power, it had better be
 in those hands of which the people are most likely to be jealous
 than in those of which they are least likely to be jealous. For it
 is a truth, which the experience of ages has attested, that the
 people are always most in danger when the means of injuring their
 rights are in the possession of those of whom they entertain the
 least suspicion.
The framers of the existing Confederation, fully aware of the
 danger to the Union from the separate possession of military forces
 by the States, have, in express terms, prohibited them from having
 either ships or troops, unless with the consent of Congress. The
 truth is, that the existence of a federal government and military
 establishments under State authority are not less at variance with
 each other than a due supply of the federal treasury and the system
 of quotas and requisitions.
There are other lights besides those already taken notice of, in
 which the impropriety of restraints on the discretion of the
 national legislature will be equally manifest. The design of the
 objection, which has been mentioned, is to preclude standing armies
 in time of peace, though we have never been informed how far it is
 designed the prohibition should extend; whether to raising armies
 as well as to KEEPING THEM UP in a season of tranquillity or not.
 If it be confined to the latter it will have no precise
 signification, and it will be ineffectual for the purpose intended.
 When armies are once raised what shall be denominated ``keeping
 them up,'' contrary to the sense of the Constitution? What time
 shall be requisite to ascertain the violation? Shall it be a week,
 a month, a year? Or shall we say they may be continued as long as
 the danger which occasioned their being raised continues? This
 would be to admit that they might be kept up IN TIME OF PEACE,
 against threatening or impending danger, which would be at once to
 deviate from the literal meaning of the prohibition, and to
 introduce an extensive latitude of construction. Who shall judge of
 the continuance of the danger? This must undoubtedly be submitted
 to the national government, and the matter would then be brought to
 this issue, that the national government, to provide against
 apprehended danger, might in the first instance raise troops, and
 might afterwards keep them on foot as long as they supposed the
 peace or safety of the community was in any degree of jeopardy. It
 is easy to perceive that a discretion so latitudinary as this would
 afford ample room for eluding the force of the provision.
The supposed utility of a provision of this kind can only be
 founded on the supposed probability, or at least possibility, of a
 combination between the executive and the legislative, in some
 scheme of usurpation. Should this at any time happen, how easy
 would it be to fabricate pretenses of approaching danger! Indian
 hostilities, instigated by Spain or Britain, would always be at hand.
 Provocations to produce the desired appearances might even be
 given to some foreign power, and appeased again by timely
 concessions. If we can reasonably presume such a combination to
 have been formed, and that the enterprise is warranted by a
 sufficient prospect of success, the army, when once raised, from
 whatever cause, or on whatever pretext, may be applied to the
 execution of the project.
If, to obviate this consequence, it should be resolved to extend
 the prohibition to the RAISING of armies in time of peace, the
 United States would then exhibit the most extraordinary spectacle
 which the world has yet seen, that of a nation incapacitated by its
 Constitution to prepare for defense, before it was actually invaded.
 As the ceremony of a formal denunciation of war has of late fallen
 into disuse, the presence of an enemy within our territories must be
 waited for, as the legal warrant to the government to begin its
 levies of men for the protection of the State. We must receive the
 blow, before we could even prepare to return it. All that kind of
 policy by which nations anticipate distant danger, and meet the
 gathering storm, must be abstained from, as contrary to the genuine
 maxims of a free government. We must expose our property and
 liberty to the mercy of foreign invaders, and invite them by our
 weakness to seize the naked and defenseless prey, because we are
 afraid that rulers, created by our choice, dependent on our will,
 might endanger that liberty, by an abuse of the means necessary to
 its preservation.
Here I expect we shall be told that the militia of the country
 is its natural bulwark, and would be at all times equal to the
 national defense. This doctrine, in substance, had like to have
 lost us our independence. It cost millions to the United States
 that might have been saved. The facts which, from our own
 experience, forbid a reliance of this kind, are too recent to permit
 us to be the dupes of such a suggestion. The steady operations of
 war against a regular and disciplined army can only be successfully
 conducted by a force of the same kind. Considerations of economy,
 not less than of stability and vigor, confirm this position. The
 American militia, in the course of the late war, have, by their
 valor on numerous occasions, erected eternal monuments to their
 fame; but the bravest of them feel and know that the liberty of
 their country could not have been established by their efforts
 alone, however great and valuable they were. War, like most other
 things, is a science to be acquired and perfected by diligence, by
 perserverance, by time, and by practice.
All violent policy, as it is contrary to the natural and
 experienced course of human affairs, defeats itself. Pennsylvania,
 at this instant, affords an example of the truth of this remark.
 The Bill of Rights of that State declares that standing armies are
 dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be kept up in time of peace.
 Pennsylvania, nevertheless, in a time of profound peace, from the
 existence of partial disorders in one or two of her counties, has
 resolved to raise a body of troops; and in all probability will
 keep them up as long as there is any appearance of danger to the
 public peace. The conduct of Massachusetts affords a lesson on the
 same subject, though on different ground. That State (without
 waiting for the sanction of Congress, as the articles of the
 Confederation require) was compelled to raise troops to quell a
 domestic insurrection, and still keeps a corps in pay to prevent a
 revival of the spirit of revolt. The particular constitution of
 Massachusetts opposed no obstacle to the measure; but the instance
 is still of use to instruct us that cases are likely to occur under
 our government, as well as under those of other nations, which will
 sometimes render a military force in time of peace essential to the
 security of the society, and that it is therefore improper in this
 respect to control the legislative discretion. It also teaches us,
 in its application to the United States, how little the rights of a
 feeble government are likely to be respected, even by its own
 constituents. And it teaches us, in addition to the rest, how
 unequal parchment provisions are to a struggle with public necessity
.
It was a fundamental maxim of the Lacedaemonian commonwealth,
 that the post of admiral should not be conferred twice on the same
 person. The Peloponnesian confederates, having suffered a severe
 defeat at sea from the Athenians, demanded Lysander, who had before
 served with success in that capacity, to command the combined fleets.
 The Lacedaemonians, to gratify their allies, and yet preserve the
 semblance of an adherence to their ancient institutions, had
 recourse to the flimsy subterfuge of investing Lysander with the
 real power of admiral, under the nominal title of vice-admiral.
 This instance is selected from among a multitude that might be
 cited to confirm the truth already advanced and illustrated by
 domestic examples; which is, that nations pay little regard to
 rules and maxims calculated in their very nature to run counter to
 the necessities of society. Wise politicians will be cautious about
 fettering the government with restrictions that cannot be observed,
 because they know that every breach of the fundamental laws, though
 dictated by necessity, impairs that sacred reverence which ought to
 be maintained in the breast of rulers towards the constitution of a
 country, and forms a precedent for other breaches where the same
 plea of necessity does not exist at all, or is less urgent and
 palpable.

FEDERALIST No. 26

The Idea of Restraining the Legislative Authority in Regard to the
 Common Defense Considered
For the Independent Journal.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
IT WAS a thing hardly to be expected that in a popular
 revolution the minds of men should stop at that happy mean which
 marks the salutary boundary between POWER and PRIVILEGE, and
 combines the energy of government with the security of private
 rights. A failure in this delicate and important point is the great
 source of the inconveniences we experience, and if we are not
 cautious to avoid a repetition of the error, in our future attempts
 to rectify and ameliorate our system, we may travel from one
 chimerical project to another; we may try change after change; but
 we shall never be likely to make any material change for the better.
The idea of restraining the legislative authority, in the means
 of providing for the national defense, is one of those refinements
 which owe their origin to a zeal for liberty more ardent than
 enlightened. We have seen, however, that it has not had thus far an
 extensive prevalency; that even in this country, where it made its
 first appearance, Pennsylvania and North Carolina are the only two
 States by which it has been in any degree patronized; and that all
 the others have refused to give it the least countenance; wisely
 judging that confidence must be placed somewhere; that the
 necessity of doing it, is implied in the very act of delegating
 power; and that it is better to hazard the abuse of that confidence
 than to embarrass the government and endanger the public safety by
 impolitic restrictions on the legislative authority. The opponents
 of the proposed Constitution combat, in this respect, the general
 decision of America; and instead of being taught by experience the
 propriety of correcting any extremes into which we may have
 heretofore run, they appear disposed to conduct us into others still
 more dangerous, and more extravagant. As if the tone of government
 had been found too high, or too rigid, the doctrines they teach are
 calculated to induce us to depress or to relax it, by expedients
 which, upon other occasions, have been condemned or forborne. It
 may be affirmed without the imputation of invective, that if the
 principles they inculcate, on various points, could so far obtain as
 to become the popular creed, they would utterly unfit the people of
 this country for any species of government whatever. But a danger
 of this kind is not to be apprehended. The citizens of America have
 too much discernment to be argued into anarchy. And I am much
 mistaken, if experience has not wrought a deep and solemn conviction
 in the public mind, that greater energy of government is essential
 to the welfare and prosperity of the community.
It may not be amiss in this place concisely to remark the origin
 and progress of the idea, which aims at the exclusion of military
 establishments in time of peace. Though in speculative minds it may
 arise from a contemplation of the nature and tendency of such
 institutions, fortified by the events that have happened in other
 ages and countries, yet as a national sentiment, it must be traced
 to those habits of thinking which we derive from the nation from
 whom the inhabitants of these States have in general sprung.
In England, for a long time after the Norman Conquest, the
 authority of the monarch was almost unlimited. Inroads were
 gradually made upon the prerogative, in favor of liberty, first by
 the barons, and afterwards by the people, till the greatest part of
 its most formidable pretensions became extinct. But it was not till
 the revolution in 1688, which elevated the Prince of Orange to the
 throne of Great Britain, that English liberty was completely
 triumphant. As incident to the undefined power of making war, an
 acknowledged prerogative of the crown, Charles II. had, by his own
 authority, kept on foot in time of peace a body of 5,000 regular
 troops. And this number James II. increased to 30,000; who were
 paid out of his civil list. At the revolution, to abolish the
 exercise of so dangerous an authority, it became an article of the
 Bill of Rights then framed, that ``the raising or keeping a standing
 army within the kingdom in time of peace, UNLESS WITH THE CONSENT OF
 PARLIAMENT, was against law.''
In that kingdom, when the pulse of liberty was at its highest
 pitch, no security against the danger of standing armies was thought
 requisite, beyond a prohibition of their being raised or kept up by
 the mere authority of the executive magistrate. The patriots, who
 effected that memorable revolution, were too temperate, too
 wellinformed, to think of any restraint on the legislative
 discretion. They were aware that a certain number of troops for
 guards and garrisons were indispensable; that no precise bounds
 could be set to the national exigencies; that a power equal to
 every possible contingency must exist somewhere in the government:
 and that when they referred the exercise of that power to the
 judgment of the legislature, they had arrived at the ultimate point
 of precaution which was reconcilable with the safety of the
 community.
From the same source, the people of America may be said to have
 derived an hereditary impression of danger to liberty, from standing
 armies in time of peace. The circumstances of a revolution
 quickened the public sensibility on every point connected with the
 security of popular rights, and in some instances raise the warmth
 of our zeal beyond the degree which consisted with the due
 temperature of the body politic. The attempts of two of the States
 to restrict the authority of the legislature in the article of
 military establishments, are of the number of these instances. The
 principles which had taught us to be jealous of the power of an
 hereditary monarch were by an injudicious excess extended to the
 representatives of the people in their popular assemblies. Even in
 some of the States, where this error was not adopted, we find
 unnecessary declarations that standing armies ought not to be kept
 up, in time of peace, WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE LEGISLATURE. I
 call them unnecessary, because the reason which had introduced a
 similar provision into the English Bill of Rights is not applicable
 to any of the State constitutions. The power of raising armies at
 all, under those constitutions, can by no construction be deemed to
 reside anywhere else, than in the legislatures themselves; and it
 was superfluous, if not absurd, to declare that a matter should not
 be done without the consent of a body, which alone had the power of
 doing it. Accordingly, in some of these constitutions, and among
 others, in that of this State of New York, which has been justly
 celebrated, both in Europe and America, as one of the best of the
 forms of government established in this country, there is a total
 silence upon the subject.
It is remarkable, that even in the two States which seem to have
 meditated an interdiction of military establishments in time of
 peace, the mode of expression made use of is rather cautionary than
 prohibitory. It is not said, that standing armies SHALL NOT BE kept
 up, but that they OUGHT NOT to be kept up, in time of peace. This
 ambiguity of terms appears to have been the result of a conflict
 between jealousy and conviction; between the desire of excluding
 such establishments at all events, and the persuasion that an
 absolute exclusion would be unwise and unsafe.
Can it be doubted that such a provision, whenever the situation
 of public affairs was understood to require a departure from it,
 would be interpreted by the legislature into a mere admonition, and
 would be made to yield to the necessities or supposed necessities of
 the State? Let the fact already mentioned, with respect to
 Pennsylvania, decide. What then (it may be asked) is the use of
 such a provision, if it cease to operate the moment there is an
 inclination to disregard it?
Let us examine whether there be any comparison, in point of
 efficacy, between the provision alluded to and that which is
 contained in the new Constitution, for restraining the
 appropriations of money for military purposes to the period of two
 years. The former, by aiming at too much, is calculated to effect
 nothing; the latter, by steering clear of an imprudent extreme, and
 by being perfectly compatible with a proper provision for the
 exigencies of the nation, will have a salutary and powerful
 operation.
The legislature of the United States will be OBLIGED, by this
 provision, once at least in every two years, to deliberate upon the
 propriety of keeping a military force on foot; to come to a new
 resolution on the point; and to declare their sense of the matter,
 by a formal vote in the face of their constituents. They are not AT
 LIBERTY to vest in the executive department permanent funds for the
 support of an army, if they were even incautious enough to be
 willing to repose in it so improper a confidence. As the spirit of
 party, in different degrees, must be expected to infect all
 political bodies, there will be, no doubt, persons in the national
 legislature willing enough to arraign the measures and criminate the
 views of the majority. The provision for the support of a military
 force will always be a favorable topic for declamation. As often as
 the question comes forward, the public attention will be roused and
 attracted to the subject, by the party in opposition; and if the
 majority should be really disposed to exceed the proper limits, the
 community will be warned of the danger, and will have an opportunity
 of taking measures to guard against it. Independent of parties in
 the national legislature itself, as often as the period of
 discussion arrived, the State legislatures, who will always be not
 only vigilant but suspicious and jealous guardians of the rights of
 the citizens against encroachments from the federal government, will
 constantly have their attention awake to the conduct of the national
 rulers, and will be ready enough, if any thing improper appears, to
 sound the alarm to the people, and not only to be the VOICE, but, if
 necessary, the ARM of their discontent.
Schemes to subvert the liberties of a great community REQUIRE
 TIME to mature them for execution. An army, so large as seriously
 to menace those liberties, could only be formed by progressive
 augmentations; which would suppose, not merely a temporary
 combination between the legislature and executive, but a continued
 conspiracy for a series of time. Is it probable that such a
 combination would exist at all? Is it probable that it would be
 persevered in, and transmitted along through all the successive
 variations in a representative body, which biennial elections would
 naturally produce in both houses? Is it presumable, that every man,
 the instant he took his seat in the national Senate or House of
 Representatives, would commence a traitor to his constituents and to
 his country? Can it be supposed that there would not be found one
 man, discerning enough to detect so atrocious a conspiracy, or bold
 or honest enough to apprise his constituents of their danger? If
 such presumptions can fairly be made, there ought at once to be an
 end of all delegated authority. The people should resolve to recall
 all the powers they have heretofore parted with out of their own
 hands, and to divide themselves into as many States as there are
 counties, in order that they may be able to manage their own
 concerns in person.
If such suppositions could even be reasonably made, still the
 concealment of the design, for any duration, would be impracticable.
 It would be announced, by the very circumstance of augmenting the
 army to so great an extent in time of profound peace. What
 colorable reason could be assigned, in a country so situated, for
 such vast augmentations of the military force? It is impossible
 that the people could be long deceived; and the destruction of the
 project, and of the projectors, would quickly follow the discovery.
It has been said that the provision which limits the
 appropriation of money for the support of an army to the period of
 two years would be unavailing, because the Executive, when once
 possessed of a force large enough to awe the people into submission,
 would find resources in that very force sufficient to enable him to
 dispense with supplies from the acts of the legislature. But the
 question again recurs, upon what pretense could he be put in
 possession of a force of that magnitude in time of peace? If we
 suppose it to have been created in consequence of some domestic
 insurrection or foreign war, then it becomes a case not within the
 principles of the objection; for this is levelled against the power
 of keeping up troops in time of peace. Few persons will be so
 visionary as seriously to contend that military forces ought not to
 be raised to quell a rebellion or resist an invasion; and if the
 defense of the community under such circumstances should make it
 necessary to have an army so numerous as to hazard its liberty, this
 is one of those calamaties for which there is neither preventative
 nor cure. It cannot be provided against by any possible form of
 government; it might even result from a simple league offensive and
 defensive, if it should ever be necessary for the confederates or
 allies to form an army for common defense.
But it is an evil infinitely less likely to attend us in a
 united than in a disunited state; nay, it may be safely asserted
 that it is an evil altogether unlikely to attend us in the latter
 situation. It is not easy to conceive a possibility that dangers so
 formidable can assail the whole Union, as to demand a force
 considerable enough to place our liberties in the least jeopardy,
 especially if we take into our view the aid to be derived from the
 militia, which ought always to be counted upon as a valuable and
 powerful auxiliary. But in a state of disunion (as has been fully
 shown in another place), the contrary of this supposition would
 become not only probable, but almost unavoidable.

FEDERALIST No. 27

The Same Subject Continued
(The Idea of Restraining the Legislative Authority in Regard to
 the Common Defense Considered)
From the New York Packet.
Tuesday, December 25, 1787.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
IT HAS been urged, in different shapes, that a Constitution of
 the kind proposed by the convention cannot operate without the aid
 of a military force to execute its laws. This, however, like most
 other things that have been alleged on that side, rests on mere
 general assertion, unsupported by any precise or intelligible
 designation of the reasons upon which it is founded. As far as I
 have been able to divine the latent meaning of the objectors, it
 seems to originate in a presupposition that the people will be
 disinclined to the exercise of federal authority in any matter of an
 internal nature. Waiving any exception that might be taken to the
 inaccuracy or inexplicitness of the distinction between internal and
 external, let us inquire what ground there is to presuppose that
 disinclination in the people. Unless we presume at the same time
 that the powers of the general government will be worse administered
 than those of the State government, there seems to be no room for
 the presumption of ill-will, disaffection, or opposition in the
 people. I believe it may be laid down as a general rule that their
 confidence in and obedience to a government will commonly be
 proportioned to the goodness or badness of its administration. It
 must be admitted that there are exceptions to this rule; but these
 exceptions depend so entirely on accidental causes, that they cannot
 be considered as having any relation to the intrinsic merits or
 demerits of a constitution. These can only be judged of by general
 principles and maxims.
Various reasons have been suggested, in the course of these
 papers, to induce a probability that the general government will be
 better administered than the particular governments; the principal
 of which reasons are that the extension of the spheres of election
 will present a greater option, or latitude of choice, to the people;
 that through the medium of the State legislatures which are select
 bodies of men, and which are to appoint the members of the national
 Senate there is reason to expect that this branch will generally be
 composed with peculiar care and judgment; that these circumstances
 promise greater knowledge and more extensive information in the
 national councils, and that they will be less apt to be tainted by
 the spirit of faction, and more out of the reach of those occasional
 ill-humors, or temporary prejudices and propensities, which, in
 smaller societies, frequently contaminate the public councils, beget
 injustice and oppression of a part of the community, and engender
 schemes which, though they gratify a momentary inclination or
 desire, terminate in general distress, dissatisfaction, and disgust.
 Several additional reasons of considerable force, to fortify that
 probability, will occur when we come to survey, with a more critical
 eye, the interior structure of the edifice which we are invited to
 erect. It will be sufficient here to remark, that until
 satisfactory reasons can be assigned to justify an opinion, that the
 federal government is likely to be administered in such a manner as
 to render it odious or contemptible to the people, there can be no
 reasonable foundation for the supposition that the laws of the Union
 will meet with any greater obstruction from them, or will stand in
 need of any other methods to enforce their execution, than the laws
 of the particular members.
The hope of impunity is a strong incitement to sedition; the
 dread of punishment, a proportionably strong discouragement to it.
 Will not the government of the Union, which, if possessed of a due
 degree of power, can call to its aid the collective resources of the
 whole Confederacy, be more likely to repress the FORMER sentiment
 and to inspire the LATTER, than that of a single State, which can
 only command the resources within itself? A turbulent faction in a
 State may easily suppose itself able to contend with the friends to
 the government in that State; but it can hardly be so infatuated as
 to imagine itself a match for the combined efforts of the Union. If
 this reflection be just, there is less danger of resistance from
 irregular combinations of individuals to the authority of the
 Confederacy than to that of a single member.
I will, in this place, hazard an observation, which will not be
 the less just because to some it may appear new; which is, that the
 more the operations of the national authority are intermingled in
 the ordinary exercise of government, the more the citizens are
 accustomed to meet with it in the common occurrences of their
 political life, the more it is familiarized to their sight and to
 their feelings, the further it enters into those objects which touch
 the most sensible chords and put in motion the most active springs
 of the human heart, the greater will be the probability that it will
 conciliate the respect and attachment of the community. Man is very
 much a creature of habit. A thing that rarely strikes his senses
 will generally have but little influence upon his mind. A
 government continually at a distance and out of sight can hardly be
 expected to interest the sensations of the people. The inference
 is, that the authority of the Union, and the affections of the
 citizens towards it, will be strengthened, rather than weakened, by
 its extension to what are called matters of internal concern; and
 will have less occasion to recur to force, in proportion to the
 familiarity and comprehensiveness of its agency. The more it
 circulates through those channls and currents in which the passions
 of mankind naturally flow, the less will it require the aid of the
 violent and perilous expedients of compulsion.
One thing, at all events, must be evident, that a government
 like the one proposed would bid much fairer to avoid the necessity
 of using force, than that species of league contend for by most of
 its opponents; the authority of which should only operate upon the
 States in their political or collective capacities. It has been
 shown that in such a Confederacy there can be no sanction for the
 laws but force; that frequent delinquencies in the members are the
 natural offspring of the very frame of the government; and that as
 often as these happen, they can only be redressed, if at all, by war
 and violence.
The plan reported by the convention, by extending the authority
 of the federal head to the individual citizens of the several
 States, will enable the government to employ the ordinary magistracy
 of each, in the execution of its laws. It is easy to perceive that
 this will tend to destroy, in the common apprehension, all
 distinction between the sources from which they might proceed; and
 will give the federal government the same advantage for securing a
 due obedience to its authority which is enjoyed by the government of
 each State, in addition to the influence on public opinion which
 will result from the important consideration of its having power to
 call to its assistance and support the resources of the whole Union.
 It merits particular attention in this place, that the laws of the
 Confederacy, as to the ENUMERATED and LEGITIMATE objects of its
 jurisdiction, will become the SUPREME LAW of the land; to the
 observance of which all officers, legislative, executive, and
 judicial, in each State, will be bound by the sanctity of an oath.
 Thus the legislatures, courts, and magistrates, of the respective
 members, will be incorporated into the operations of the national
 government AS FAR AS ITS JUST AND CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY EXTENDS;
 and will be rendered auxiliary to the enforcement of its laws. [1%]
 Any man who will pursue, by his own reflections, the consequences
 of this situation, will perceive that there is good ground to
 calculate upon a regular and peaceable execution of the laws of the
 Union, if its powers are administered with a common share of
 prudence. If we will arbitrarily suppose the contrary, we may
 deduce any inferences we please from the supposition; for it is
 certainly possible, by an injudicious exercise of the authorities of
 the best government that ever was, or ever can be instituted, to
 provoke and precipitate the people into the wildest excesses. But
 though the adversaries of the proposed Constitution should presume
 that the national rulers would be insensible to the motives of
 public good, or to the obligations of duty, I would still ask them
 how the interests of ambition, or the views of encroachment, can be
 promoted by such a conduct?
PUBLIUS.
FNA1-@1 The sophistry which has been employed to show that this will
 tend to the destruction of the State governments, will, in its will,
 in its proper place, be fully detected.


FEDERALIST No. 28

The Same Subject Continued
(The Idea of Restraining the Legislative Authority in Regard to
 the Common Defense Considered)
For the Independent Journal.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
THAT there may happen cases in which the national government may
 be necessitated to resort to force, cannot be denied. Our own
 experience has corroborated the lessons taught by the examples of
 other nations; that emergencies of this sort will sometimes arise
 in all societies, however constituted; that seditions and
 insurrections are, unhappily, maladies as inseparable from the body
 politic as tumors and eruptions from the natural body; that the
 idea of governing at all times by the simple force of law (which we
 have been told is the only admissible principle of republican
 government), has no place but in the reveries of those political
 doctors whose sagacity disdains the admonitions of experimental
 instruction.
Should such emergencies at any time happen under the national
 government, there could be no remedy but force. The means to be
 employed must be proportioned to the extent of the mischief. If it
 should be a slight commotion in a small part of a State, the militia
 of the residue would be adequate to its suppression; and the
 national presumption is that they would be ready to do their duty.
 An insurrection, whatever may be its immediate cause, eventually
 endangers all government. Regard to the public peace, if not to the
 rights of the Union, would engage the citizens to whom the contagion
 had not communicated itself to oppose the insurgents; and if the
 general government should be found in practice conducive to the
 prosperity and felicity of the people, it were irrational to believe
 that they would be disinclined to its support.
If, on the contrary, the insurrection should pervade a whole
 State, or a principal part of it, the employment of a different kind
 of force might become unavoidable. It appears that Massachusetts
 found it necessary to raise troops for repressing the disorders
 within that State; that Pennsylvania, from the mere apprehension of
 commotions among a part of her citizens, has thought proper to have
 recourse to the same measure. Suppose the State of New York had
 been inclined to re-establish her lost jurisdiction over the
 inhabitants of Vermont, could she have hoped for success in such an
 enterprise from the efforts of the militia alone? Would she not
 have been compelled to raise and to maintain a more regular force
 for the execution of her design? If it must then be admitted that
 the necessity of recurring to a force different from the militia, in
 cases of this extraordinary nature, is applicable to the State
 governments themselves, why should the possibility, that the
 national government might be under a like necessity, in similar
 extremities, be made an objection to its existence? Is it not
 surprising that men who declare an attachment to the Union in the
 abstract, should urge as an objection to the proposed Constitution
 what applies with tenfold weight to the plan for which they contend;
 and what, as far as it has any foundation in truth, is an
 inevitable consequence of civil society upon an enlarged scale? Who
 would not prefer that possibility to the unceasing agitations and
 frequent revolutions which are the continual scourges of petty
 republics?
Let us pursue this examination in another light. Suppose, in
 lieu of one general system, two, or three, or even four
 Confederacies were to be formed, would not the same difficulty
 oppose itself to the operations of either of these Confederacies?
 Would not each of them be exposed to the same casualties; and when
 these happened, be obliged to have recourse to the same expedients
 for upholding its authority which are objected to in a government
 for all the States? Would the militia, in this supposition, be more
 ready or more able to support the federal authority than in the case
 of a general union? All candid and intelligent men must, upon due
 consideration, acknowledge that the principle of the objection is
 equally applicable to either of the two cases; and that whether we
 have one government for all the States, or different governments for
 different parcels of them, or even if there should be an entire
 separation of the States, there might sometimes be a necessity to
 make use of a force constituted differently from the militia, to
 preserve the peace of the community and to maintain the just
 authority of the laws against those violent invasions of them which
 amount to insurrections and rebellions.
Independent of all other reasonings upon the subject, it is a
 full answer to those who require a more peremptory provision against
 military establishments in time of peace, to say that the whole
 power of the proposed government is to be in the hands of the
 representatives of the people. This is the essential, and, after
 all, only efficacious security for the rights and privileges of the
 people, which is attainable in civil society. [1]
If the representatives of the people betray their constituents,
 there is then no resource left but in the exertion of that original
 right of self-defense which is paramount to all positive forms of
 government, and which against the usurpations of the national
 rulers, may be exerted with infinitely better prospect of success
 than against those of the rulers of an individual state. In a
 single state, if the persons intrusted with supreme power become
 usurpers, the different parcels, subdivisions, or districts of which
 it consists, having no distinct government in each, can take no
 regular measures for defense. The citizens must rush tumultuously
 to arms, without concert, without system, without resource; except
 in their courage and despair. The usurpers, clothed with the forms
 of legal authority, can too often crush the opposition in embryo.
 The smaller the extent of the territory, the more difficult will it
 be for the people to form a regular or systematic plan of
 opposition, and the more easy will it be to defeat their early
 efforts. Intelligence can be more speedily obtained of their
 preparations and movements, and the military force in the possession
 of the usurpers can be more rapidly directed against the part where
 the opposition has begun. In this situation there must be a
 peculiar coincidence of circumstances to insure success to the
 popular resistance.
The obstacles to usurpation and the facilities of resistance
 increase with the increased extent of the state, provided the
 citizens understand their rights and are disposed to defend them.
 The natural strength of the people in a large community, in
 proportion to the artificial strength of the government, is greater
 than in a small, and of course more competent to a struggle with the
 attempts of the government to establish a tyranny. But in a
 confederacy the people, without exaggeration, may be said to be
 entirely the masters of their own fate. Power being almost always
 the rival of power, the general government will at all times stand
 ready to check the usurpations of the state governments, and these
 will have the same disposition towards the general government. The
 people, by throwing themselves into either scale, will infallibly
 make it preponderate. If their rights are invaded by either, they
 can make use of the other as the instrument of redress. How wise
 will it be in them by cherishing the union to preserve to themselves
 an advantage which can never be too highly prized!
It may safely be received as an axiom in our political system,
 that the State governments will, in all possible contingencies,
 afford complete security against invasions of the public liberty by
 the national authority. Projects of usurpation cannot be masked
 under pretenses so likely to escape the penetration of select bodies
 of men, as of the people at large. The legislatures will have
 better means of information. They can discover the danger at a
 distance; and possessing all the organs of civil power, and the
 confidence of the people, they can at once adopt a regular plan of
 opposition, in which they can combine all the resources of the
 community. They can readily communicate with each other in the
 different States, and unite their common forces for the protection
 of their common liberty.
The great extent of the country is a further security. We have
 already experienced its utility against the attacks of a foreign
 power. And it would have precisely the same effect against the
 enterprises of ambitious rulers in the national councils. If the
 federal army should be able to quell the resistance of one State,
 the distant States would have it in their power to make head with
 fresh forces. The advantages obtained in one place must be
 abandoned to subdue the opposition in others; and the moment the
 part which had been reduced to submission was left to itself, its
 efforts would be renewed, and its resistance revive.
We should recollect that the extent of the military force must,
 at all events, be regulated by the resources of the country. For a
 long time to come, it will not be possible to maintain a large army;
 and as the means of doing this increase, the population and natural
 strength of the community will proportionably increase. When will
 the time arrive that the federal government can raise and maintain
 an army capable of erecting a despotism over the great body of the
 people of an immense empire, who are in a situation, through the
 medium of their State governments, to take measures for their own
 defense, with all the celerity, regularity, and system of
 independent nations? The apprehension may be considered as a
 disease, for which there can be found no cure in the resources of
 argument and reasoning.

FEDERALIST No. 29

Concerning the Militia
From the Daily Advertiser.
Thursday, January 10, 1788

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
THE power of regulating the militia, and of commanding its
 services in times of insurrection and invasion are natural incidents
 to the duties of superintending the common defense, and of watching
 over the internal peace of the Confederacy.
It requires no skill in the science of war to discern that
 uniformity in the organization and discipline of the militia would
 be attended with the most beneficial effects, whenever they were
 called into service for the public defense. It would enable them to
 discharge the duties of the camp and of the field with mutual
 intelligence and concert an advantage of peculiar moment in the
 operations of an army; and it would fit them much sooner to acquire
 the degree of proficiency in military functions which would be
 essential to their usefulness. This desirable uniformity can only
 be accomplished by confiding the regulation of the militia to the
 direction of the national authority. It is, therefore, with the
 most evident propriety, that the plan of the convention proposes to
 empower the Union ``to provide for organizing, arming, and
 disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may
 be employed in the service of the United States, RESERVING TO THE
 STATES RESPECTIVELY THE APPOINTMENT OF THE OFFICERS, AND THE
 AUTHORITY OF TRAINING THE MILITIA ACCORDING TO THE DISCIPLINE
 PRESCRIBED BY CONGRESS.''
Of the different grounds which have been taken in opposition to
 the plan of the convention, there is none that was so little to have
 been expected, or is so untenable in itself, as the one from which
 this particular provision has been attacked. If a well-regulated
 militia be the most natural defense of a free country, it ought
 certainly to be under the regulation and at the disposal of that
 body which is constituted the guardian of the national security. If
 standing armies are dangerous to liberty, an efficacious power over
 the militia, in the body to whose care the protection of the State
 is committed, ought, as far as possible, to take away the inducement
 and the pretext to such unfriendly institutions. If the federal
 government can command the aid of the militia in those emergencies
 which call for the military arm in support of the civil magistrate,
 it can the better dispense with the employment of a different kind
 of force. If it cannot avail itself of the former, it will be
 obliged to recur to the latter. To render an army unnecessary, will
 be a more certain method of preventing its existence than a thousand
 prohibitions upon paper.
In order to cast an odium upon the power of calling forth the
 militia to execute the laws of the Union, it has been remarked that
 there is nowhere any provision in the proposed Constitution for
 calling out the POSSE COMITATUS, to assist the magistrate in the
 execution of his duty, whence it has been inferred, that military
 force was intended to be his only auxiliary. There is a striking
 incoherence in the objections which have appeared, and sometimes
 even from the same quarter, not much calculated to inspire a very
 favorable opinion of the sincerity or fair dealing of their authors.
 The same persons who tell us in one breath, that the powers of the
 federal government will be despotic and unlimited, inform us in the
 next, that it has not authority sufficient even to call out the
 POSSE COMITATUS. The latter, fortunately, is as much short of the
 truth as the former exceeds it. It would be as absurd to doubt,
 that a right to pass all laws NECESSARY AND PROPER to execute its
 declared powers, would include that of requiring the assistance of
 the citizens to the officers who may be intrusted with the execution
 of those laws, as it would be to believe, that a right to enact laws
 necessary and proper for the imposition and collection of taxes
 would involve that of varying the rules of descent and of the
 alienation of landed property, or of abolishing the trial by jury in
 cases relating to it. It being therefore evident that the
 supposition of a want of power to require the aid of the POSSE
 COMITATUS is entirely destitute of color, it will follow, that the
 conclusion which has been drawn from it, in its application to the
 authority of the federal government over the militia, is as uncandid
 as it is illogical. What reason could there be to infer, that force
 was intended to be the sole instrument of authority, merely because
 there is a power to make use of it when necessary? What shall we
 think of the motives which could induce men of sense to reason in
 this manner? How shall we prevent a conflict between charity and
 judgment?
By a curious refinement upon the spirit of republican jealousy,
 we are even taught to apprehend danger from the militia itself, in
 the hands of the federal government. It is observed that select
 corps may be formed, composed of the young and ardent, who may be
 rendered subservient to the views of arbitrary power. What plan for
 the regulation of the militia may be pursued by the national
 government, is impossible to be foreseen. But so far from viewing
 the matter in the same light with those who object to select corps
 as dangerous, were the Constitution ratified, and were I to deliver
 my sentiments to a member of the federal legislature from this State
 on the subject of a militia establishment, I should hold to him, in
 substance, the following discourse:
``The project of disciplining all the militia of the United
 States is as futile as it would be injurious, if it were capable of
 being carried into execution. A tolerable expertness in military
 movements is a business that requires time and practice. It is not
 a day, or even a week, that will suffice for the attainment of it.
 To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes
 of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through
 military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to
 acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the
 character of a well-regulated militia, would be a real grievance to
 the people, and a serious public inconvenience and loss. It would
 form an annual deduction from the productive labor of the country,
 to an amount which, calculating upon the present numbers of the
 people, would not fall far short of the whole expense of the civil
 establishments of all the States. To attempt a thing which would
 abridge the mass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent,
 would be unwise: and the experiment, if made, could not succeed,
 because it would not long be endured. Little more can reasonably be
 aimed at, with respect to the people at large, than to have them
 properly armed and equipped; and in order to see that this be not
 neglected, it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in
 the course of a year.
``But though the scheme of disciplining the whole nation must be
 abandoned as mischievous or impracticable; yet it is a matter of
 the utmost importance that a well-digested plan should, as soon as
 possible, be adopted for the proper establishment of the militia.
 The attention of the government ought particularly to be directed
 to the formation of a select corps of moderate extent, upon such
 principles as will really fit them for service in case of need. By
 thus circumscribing the plan, it will be possible to have an
 excellent body of well-trained militia, ready to take the field
 whenever the defense of the State shall require it. This will not
 only lessen the call for military establishments, but if
 circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an
 army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the
 liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens,
 little, if at all, inferior to them in discipline and the use of
 arms, who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their
 fellow-citizens. This appears to me the only substitute that can be
 devised for a standing army, and the best possible security against
 it, if it should exist.''
Thus differently from the adversaries of the proposed
 Constitution should I reason on the same subject, deducing arguments
 of safety from the very sources which they represent as fraught with
 danger and perdition. But how the national legislature may reason
 on the point, is a thing which neither they nor I can foresee.
There is something so far-fetched and so extravagant in the idea
 of danger to liberty from the militia, that one is at a loss whether
 to treat it with gravity or with raillery; whether to consider it
 as a mere trial of skill, like the paradoxes of rhetoricians; as a
 disingenuous artifice to instil prejudices at any price; or as the
 serious offspring of political fanaticism. Where in the name of
 common-sense, are our fears to end if we may not trust our sons, our
 brothers, our neighbors, our fellow-citizens? What shadow of danger
 can there be from men who are daily mingling with the rest of their
 countrymen and who participate with them in the same feelings,
 sentiments, habits and interests? What reasonable cause of
 apprehension can be inferred from a power in the Union to prescribe
 regulations for the militia, and to command its services when
 necessary, while the particular States are to have the SOLE AND
 EXCLUSIVE APPOINTMENT OF THE OFFICERS? If it were possible
 seriously to indulge a jealousy of the militia upon any conceivable
 establishment under the federal government, the circumstance of the
 officers being in the appointment of the States ought at once to
 extinguish it. There can be no doubt that this circumstance will
 always secure to them a preponderating influence over the militia.
In reading many of the publications against the Constitution, a
 man is apt to imagine that he is perusing some ill-written tale or
 romance, which instead of natural and agreeable images, exhibits to
 the mind nothing but frightful and distorted shapes ``Gorgons, hydras,
 and chimeras dire''; discoloring and disfiguring whatever it represents,
 and transforming everything it touches into a monster.
A sample of this is to be observed in the exaggerated and
 improbable suggestions which have taken place respecting the power
 of calling for the services of the militia. That of New Hampshire
 is to be marched to Georgia, of Georgia to New Hampshire, of New
 York to Kentucky, and of Kentucky to Lake Champlain. Nay, the debts
 due to the French and Dutch are to be paid in militiamen instead of
 louis d'ors and ducats. At one moment there is to be a large army
 to lay prostrate the liberties of the people; at another moment the
 militia of Virginia are to be dragged from their homes five or six
 hundred miles, to tame the republican contumacy of Massachusetts;
 and that of Massachusetts is to be transported an equal distance to
 subdue the refractory haughtiness of the aristocratic Virginians.
 Do the persons who rave at this rate imagine that their art or
 their eloquence can impose any conceits or absurdities upon the
 people of America for infallible truths?
If there should be an army to be made use of as the engine of
 despotism, what need of the militia? If there should be no army,
 whither would the militia, irritated by being called upon to
 undertake a distant and hopeless expedition, for the purpose of
 riveting the chains of slavery upon a part of their countrymen,
 direct their course, but to the seat of the tyrants, who had
 meditated so foolish as well as so wicked a project, to crush them
 in their imagined intrenchments of power, and to make them an
 example of the just vengeance of an abused and incensed people? Is
 this the way in which usurpers stride to dominion over a numerous
 and enlightened nation? Do they begin by exciting the detestation
 of the very instruments of their intended usurpations? Do they
 usually commence their career by wanton and disgustful acts of
 power, calculated to answer no end, but to draw upon themselves
 universal hatred and execration? Are suppositions of this sort the
 sober admonitions of discerning patriots to a discerning people? Or
 are they the inflammatory ravings of incendiaries or distempered
 enthusiasts? If we were even to suppose the national rulers
 actuated by the most ungovernable ambition, it is impossible to
 believe that they would employ such preposterous means to accomplish
 their designs.
In times of insurrection, or invasion, it would be natural and
 proper that the militia of a neighboring State should be marched
 into another, to resist a common enemy, or to guard the republic
 against the violence of faction or sedition. This was frequently
 the case, in respect to the first object, in the course of the late
 war; and this mutual succor is, indeed, a principal end of our
 political association. If the power of affording it be placed under
 the direction of the Union, there will be no danger of a supine and
 listless inattention to the dangers of a neighbor, till its near
 approach had superadded the incitements of selfpreservation to the
 too feeble impulses of duty and sympathy.

FEDERALIST No. 30

Concerning the General Power of Taxation
From the New York Packet.
Friday, December 28, 1787.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
IT HAS been already observed that the federal government ought
 to possess the power of providing for the support of the national
 forces; in which proposition was intended to be included the
 expense of raising troops, of building and equipping fleets, and all
 other expenses in any wise connected with military arrangements and
 operations. But these are not the only objects to which the
 jurisdiction of the Union, in respect to revenue, must necessarily
 be empowered to extend. It must embrace a provision for the support
 of the national civil list; for the payment of the national debts
 contracted, or that may be contracted; and, in general, for all
 those matters which will call for disbursements out of the national
 treasury. The conclusion is, that there must be interwoven, in the
 frame of the government, a general power of taxation, in one shape
 or another.
Money is, with propriety, considered as the vital principle of
 the body politic; as that which sustains its life and motion, and
 enables it to perform its most essential functions. A complete
 power, therefore, to procure a regular and adequate supply of it, as
 far as the resources of the community will permit, may be regarded
 as an indispensable ingredient in every constitution. From a
 deficiency in this particular, one of two evils must ensue; either
 the people must be subjected to continual plunder, as a substitute
 for a more eligible mode of supplying the public wants, or the
 government must sink into a fatal atrophy, and, in a short course of
 time, perish.
In the Ottoman or Turkish empire, the sovereign, though in other
 respects absolute master of the lives and fortunes of his subjects,
 has no right to impose a new tax. The consequence is that he
 permits the bashaws or governors of provinces to pillage the people
 without mercy; and, in turn, squeezes out of them the sums of which
 he stands in need, to satisfy his own exigencies and those of the
 state. In America, from a like cause, the government of the Union
 has gradually dwindled into a state of decay, approaching nearly to
 annihilation. Who can doubt, that the happiness of the people in
 both countries would be promoted by competent authorities in the
 proper hands, to provide the revenues which the necessities of the
 public might require?
The present Confederation, feeble as it is intended to repose in
 the United States, an unlimited power of providing for the pecuniary
 wants of the Union. But proceeding upon an erroneous principle, it
 has been done in such a manner as entirely to have frustrated the
 intention. Congress, by the articles which compose that compact (as
 has already been stated), are authorized to ascertain and call for
 any sums of money necessary, in their judgment, to the service of
 the United States; and their requisitions, if conformable to the
 rule of apportionment, are in every constitutional sense obligatory
 upon the States. These have no right to question the propriety of
 the demand; no discretion beyond that of devising the ways and
 means of furnishing the sums demanded. But though this be strictly
 and truly the case; though the assumption of such a right would be
 an infringement of the articles of Union; though it may seldom or
 never have been avowedly claimed, yet in practice it has been
 constantly exercised, and would continue to be so, as long as the
 revenues of the Confederacy should remain dependent on the
 intermediate agency of its members. What the consequences of this
 system have been, is within the knowledge of every man the least
 conversant in our public affairs, and has been amply unfolded in
 different parts of these inquiries. It is this which has chiefly
 contributed to reduce us to a situation, which affords ample cause
 both of mortification to ourselves, and of triumph to our enemies.
What remedy can there be for this situation, but in a change of
 the system which has produced it in a change of the fallacious and
 delusive system of quotas and requisitions? What substitute can
 there be imagined for this ignis fatuus in finance, but that of
 permitting the national government to raise its own revenues by the
 ordinary methods of taxation authorized in every well-ordered
 constitution of civil government? Ingenious men may declaim with
 plausibility on any subject; but no human ingenuity can point out
 any other expedient to rescue us from the inconveniences and
 embarrassments naturally resulting from defective supplies of the
 public treasury.
The more intelligent adversaries of the new Constitution admit
 the force of this reasoning; but they qualify their admission by a
 distinction between what they call INTERNAL and EXTERNAL taxation.
 The former they would reserve to the State governments; the
 latter, which they explain into commercial imposts, or rather duties
 on imported articles, they declare themselves willing to concede to
 the federal head. This distinction, however, would violate the
 maxim of good sense and sound policy, which dictates that every
 POWER ought to be in proportion to its OBJECT; and would still
 leave the general government in a kind of tutelage to the State
 governments, inconsistent with every idea of vigor or efficiency.
 Who can pretend that commercial imposts are, or would be, alone
 equal to the present and future exigencies of the Union? Taking
 into the account the existing debt, foreign and domestic, upon any
 plan of extinguishment which a man moderately impressed with the
 importance of public justice and public credit could approve, in
 addition to the establishments which all parties will acknowledge to
 be necessary, we could not reasonably flatter ourselves, that this
 resource alone, upon the most improved scale, would even suffice for
 its present necessities. Its future necessities admit not of
 calculation or limitation; and upon the principle, more than once
 adverted to, the power of making provision for them as they arise
 ought to be equally unconfined. I believe it may be regarded as a
 position warranted by the history of mankind, that, IN THE USUAL
 PROGRESS OF THINGS, THE NECESSITIES OF A NATION, IN EVERY STAGE OF
 ITS EXISTENCE, WILL BE FOUND AT LEAST EQUAL TO ITS RESOURCES.
To say that deficiencies may be provided for by requisitions
 upon the States, is on the one hand to acknowledge that this system
 cannot be depended upon, and on the other hand to depend upon it for
 every thing beyond a certain limit. Those who have carefully
 attended to its vices and deformities as they have been exhibited by
 experience or delineated in the course of these papers, must feel
 invincible repugnancy to trusting the national interests in any
 degree to its operation. Its inevitable tendency, whenever it is
 brought into activity, must be to enfeeble the Union, and sow the
 seeds of discord and contention between the federal head and its
 members, and between the members themselves. Can it be expected
 that the deficiencies would be better supplied in this mode than the
 total wants of the Union have heretofore been supplied in the same
 mode? It ought to be recollected that if less will be required from
 the States, they will have proportionably less means to answer the
 demand. If the opinions of those who contend for the distinction
 which has been mentioned were to be received as evidence of truth,
 one would be led to conclude that there was some known point in the
 economy of national affairs at which it would be safe to stop and to
 say: Thus far the ends of public happiness will be promoted by
 supplying the wants of government, and all beyond this is unworthy
 of our care or anxiety. How is it possible that a government half
 supplied and always necessitous, can fulfill the purposes of its
 institution, can provide for the security, advance the prosperity,
 or support the reputation of the commonwealth? How can it ever
 possess either energy or stability, dignity or credit, confidence at
 home or respectability abroad? How can its administration be any
 thing else than a succession of expedients temporizing, impotent,
 disgraceful? How will it be able to avoid a frequent sacrifice of
 its engagements to immediate necessity? How can it undertake or
 execute any liberal or enlarged plans of public good?
Let us attend to what would be the effects of this situation in
 the very first war in which we should happen to be engaged. We will
 presume, for argument's sake, that the revenue arising from the
 impost duties answers the purposes of a provision for the public
 debt and of a peace establishment for the Union. Thus
 circumstanced, a war breaks out. What would be the probable conduct
 of the government in such an emergency? Taught by experience that
 proper dependence could not be placed on the success of
 requisitions, unable by its own authority to lay hold of fresh
 resources, and urged by considerations of national danger, would it
 not be driven to the expedient of diverting the funds already
 appropriated from their proper objects to the defense of the State?
 It is not easy to see how a step of this kind could be avoided;
 and if it should be taken, it is evident that it would prove the
 destruction of public credit at the very moment that it was becoming
 essential to the public safety. To imagine that at such a crisis
 credit might be dispensed with, would be the extreme of infatuation.
 In the modern system of war, nations the most wealthy are obliged
 to have recourse to large loans. A country so little opulent as
 ours must feel this necessity in a much stronger degree. But who
 would lend to a government that prefaced its overtures for borrowing
 by an act which demonstrated that no reliance could be placed on the
 steadiness of its measures for paying? The loans it might be able
 to procure would be as limited in their extent as burdensome in
 their conditions. They would be made upon the same principles that
 usurers commonly lend to bankrupt and fraudulent debtors, with a
 sparing hand and at enormous premiums.
It may perhaps be imagined that, from the scantiness of the
 resources of the country, the necessity of diverting the established
 funds in the case supposed would exist, though the national
 government should possess an unrestrained power of taxation. But
 two considerations will serve to quiet all apprehension on this
 head: one is, that we are sure the resources of the community, in
 their full extent, will be brought into activity for the benefit of
 the Union; the other is, that whatever deficiences there may be,
 can without difficulty be supplied by loans.
The power of creating new funds upon new objects of taxation, by
 its own authority, would enable the national government to borrow as
 far as its necessities might require. Foreigners, as well as the
 citizens of America, could then reasonably repose confidence in its
 engagements; but to depend upon a government that must itself
 depend upon thirteen other governments for the means of fulfilling
 its contracts, when once its situation is clearly understood, would
 require a degree of credulity not often to be met with in the
 pecuniary transactions of mankind, and little reconcilable with the
 usual sharp-sightedness of avarice.
Reflections of this kind may have trifling weight with men who
 hope to see realized in America the halcyon scenes of the poetic or
 fabulous age; but to those who believe we are likely to experience
 a common portion of the vicissitudes and calamities which have
 fallen to the lot of other nations, they must appear entitled to
 serious attention. Such men must behold the actual situation of
 their country with painful solicitude, and deprecate the evils which
 ambition or revenge might, with too much facility, inflict upon it.

FEDERALIST No. 31

The Same Subject Continued
(Concerning the General Power of Taxation)
From the New York Packet.
Tuesday, January 1, 1788.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
IN DISQUISITIONS of every kind, there are certain primary
 truths, or first principles, upon which all subsequent reasonings
 must depend. These contain an internal evidence which, antecedent
 to all reflection or combination, commands the assent of the mind.
 Where it produces not this effect, it must proceed either from some
 defect or disorder in the organs of perception, or from the
 influence of some strong interest, or passion, or prejudice. Of
 this nature are the maxims in geometry, that ``the whole is greater
 than its part; things equal to the same are equal to one another;
 two straight lines cannot enclose a space; and all right angles
 are equal to each other.'' Of the same nature are these other
 maxims in ethics and politics, that there cannot be an effect
 without a cause; that the means ought to be proportioned to the
 end; that every power ought to be commensurate with its object;
 that there ought to be no limitation of a power destined to effect
 a purpose which is itself incapable of limitation. And there are
 other truths in the two latter sciences which, if they cannot
 pretend to rank in the class of axioms, are yet such direct
 inferences from them, and so obvious in themselves, and so agreeable
 to the natural and unsophisticated dictates of common-sense, that
 they challenge the assent of a sound and unbiased mind, with a
 degree of force and conviction almost equally irresistible.
The objects of geometrical inquiry are so entirely abstracted
 from those pursuits which stir up and put in motion the unruly
 passions of the human heart, that mankind, without difficulty, adopt
 not only the more simple theorems of the science, but even those
 abstruse paradoxes which, however they may appear susceptible of
 demonstration, are at variance with the natural conceptions which
 the mind, without the aid of philosophy, would be led to entertain
 upon the subject. The INFINITE DIVISIBILITY of matter, or, in other
 words, the INFINITE divisibility of a FINITE thing, extending even
 to the minutest atom, is a point agreed among geometricians, though
 not less incomprehensible to common-sense than any of those
 mysteries in religion, against which the batteries of infidelity
 have been so industriously leveled.
But in the sciences of morals and politics, men are found far
 less tractable. To a certain degree, it is right and useful that
 this should be the case. Caution and investigation are a necessary
 armor against error and imposition. But this untractableness may be
 carried too far, and may degenerate into obstinacy, perverseness, or
 disingenuity. Though it cannot be pretended that the principles of
 moral and political knowledge have, in general, the same degree of
 certainty with those of the mathematics, yet they have much better
 claims in this respect than, to judge from the conduct of men in
 particular situations, we should be disposed to allow them. The
 obscurity is much oftener in the passions and prejudices of the
 reasoner than in the subject. Men, upon too many occasions, do not
 give their own understandings fair play; but, yielding to some
 untoward bias, they entangle themselves in words and confound
 themselves in subtleties.
How else could it happen (if we admit the objectors to be
 sincere in their opposition), that positions so clear as those which
 manifest the necessity of a general power of taxation in the
 government of the Union, should have to encounter any adversaries
 among men of discernment? Though these positions have been
 elsewhere fully stated, they will perhaps not be improperly
 recapitulated in this place, as introductory to an examination of
 what may have been offered by way of objection to them. They are in
 substance as follows:
A government ought to contain in itself every power requisite to
 the full accomplishment of the objects committed to its care, and to
 the complete execution of the trusts for which it is responsible,
 free from every other control but a regard to the public good and to
 the sense of the people.
As the duties of superintending the national defense and of
 securing the public peace against foreign or domestic violence
 involve a provision for casualties and dangers to which no possible
 limits can be assigned, the power of making that provision ought to
 know no other bounds than the exigencies of the nation and the
 resources of the community.
As revenue is the essential engine by which the means of
 answering the national exigencies must be procured, the power of
 procuring that article in its full extent must necessarily be
 comprehended in that of providing for those exigencies.
As theory and practice conspire to prove that the power of
 procuring revenue is unavailing when exercised over the States in
 their collective capacities, the federal government must of
 necessity be invested with an unqualified power of taxation in the
 ordinary modes.
Did not experience evince the contrary, it would be natural to
 conclude that the propriety of a general power of taxation in the
 national government might safely be permitted to rest on the
 evidence of these propositions, unassisted by any additional
 arguments or illustrations. But we find, in fact, that the
 antagonists of the proposed Constitution, so far from acquiescing in
 their justness or truth, seem to make their principal and most
 zealous effort against this part of the plan. It may therefore be
 satisfactory to analyze the arguments with which they combat it.
Those of them which have been most labored with that view, seem
 in substance to amount to this: ``It is not true, because the
 exigencies of the Union may not be susceptible of limitation, that
 its power of laying taxes ought to be unconfined. Revenue is as
 requisite to the purposes of the local administrations as to those
 of the Union; and the former are at least of equal importance with
 the latter to the happiness of the people. It is, therefore, as
 necessary that the State governments should be able to command the
 means of supplying their wants, as that the national government
 should possess the like faculty in respect to the wants of the Union.
 But an indefinite power of taxation in the LATTER might, and
 probably would in time, deprive the FORMER of the means of providing
 for their own necessities; and would subject them entirely to the
 mercy of the national legislature. As the laws of the Union are to
 become the supreme law of the land, as it is to have power to pass
 all laws that may be NECESSARY for carrying into execution the
 authorities with which it is proposed to vest it, the national
 government might at any time abolish the taxes imposed for State
 objects upon the pretense of an interference with its own. It might
 allege a necessity of doing this in order to give efficacy to the
 national revenues. And thus all the resources of taxation might by
 degrees become the subjects of federal monopoly, to the entire
 exclusion and destruction of the State governments.''
This mode of reasoning appears sometimes to turn upon the
 supposition of usurpation in the national government; at other
 times it seems to be designed only as a deduction from the
 constitutional operation of its intended powers. It is only in the
 latter light that it can be admitted to have any pretensions to
 fairness. The moment we launch into conjectures about the
 usurpations of the federal government, we get into an unfathomable
 abyss, and fairly put ourselves out of the reach of all reasoning.
 Imagination may range at pleasure till it gets bewildered amidst
 the labyrinths of an enchanted castle, and knows not on which side
 to turn to extricate itself from the perplexities into which it has
 so rashly adventured. Whatever may be the limits or modifications
 of the powers of the Union, it is easy to imagine an endless train
 of possible dangers; and by indulging an excess of jealousy and
 timidity, we may bring ourselves to a state of absolute scepticism
 and irresolution. I repeat here what I have observed in substance
 in another place, that all observations founded upon the danger of
 usurpation ought to be referred to the composition and structure of
 the government, not to the nature or extent of its powers. The
 State governments, by their original constitutions, are invested
 with complete sovereignty. In what does our security consist
 against usurpation from that quarter? Doubtless in the manner of
 their formation, and in a due dependence of those who are to
 administer them upon the people. If the proposed construction of
 the federal government be found, upon an impartial examination of
 it, to be such as to afford, to a proper extent, the same species of
 security, all apprehensions on the score of usurpation ought to be
 discarded.
It should not be forgotten that a disposition in the State
 governments to encroach upon the rights of the Union is quite as
 probable as a disposition in the Union to encroach upon the rights
 of the State governments. What side would be likely to prevail in
 such a conflict, must depend on the means which the contending
 parties could employ toward insuring success. As in republics
 strength is always on the side of the people, and as there are
 weighty reasons to induce a belief that the State governments will
 commonly possess most influence over them, the natural conclusion is
 that such contests will be most apt to end to the disadvantage of
 the Union; and that there is greater probability of encroachments
 by the members upon the federal head, than by the federal head upon
 the members. But it is evident that all conjectures of this kind
 must be extremely vague and fallible: and that it is by far the
 safest course to lay them altogether aside, and to confine our
 attention wholly to the nature and extent of the powers as they are
 delineated in the Constitution. Every thing beyond this must be
 left to the prudence and firmness of the people; who, as they will
 hold the scales in their own hands, it is to be hoped, will always
 take care to preserve the constitutional equilibrium between the
 general and the State governments. Upon this ground, which is
 evidently the true one, it will not be difficult to obviate the
 objections which have been made to an indefinite power of taxation
 in the United States.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
ALTHOUGH I am of opinion that there would be no real danger of
 the consequences which seem to be apprehended to the State
 governments from a power in the Union to control them in the levies
 of money, because I am persuaded that the sense of the people, the
 extreme hazard of provoking the resentments of the State
 governments, and a conviction of the utility and necessity of local
 administrations for local purposes, would be a complete barrier
 against the oppressive use of such a power; yet I am willing here
 to allow, in its full extent, the justness of the reasoning which
 requires that the individual States should possess an independent
 and uncontrollable authority to raise their own revenues for the
 supply of their own wants. And making this concession, I affirm
 that (with the sole exception of duties on imports and exports) they
 would, under the plan of the convention, retain that authority in
 the most absolute and unqualified sense; and that an attempt on the
 part of the national government to abridge them in the exercise of
 it, would be a violent assumption of power, unwarranted by any
 article or clause of its Constitution.
An entire consolidation of the States into one complete national
 sovereignty would imply an entire subordination of the parts; and
 whatever powers might remain in them, would be altogether dependent
 on the general will. But as the plan of the convention aims only at
 a partial union or consolidation, the State governments would
 clearly retain all the rights of sovereignty which they before had,
 and which were not, by that act, EXCLUSIVELY delegated to the United
 States. This exclusive delegation, or rather this alienation, of
 State sovereignty, would only exist in three cases: where the
 Constitution in express terms granted an exclusive authority to the
 Union; where it granted in one instance an authority to the Union,
 and in another prohibited the States from exercising the like
 authority; and where it granted an authority to the Union, to which
 a similar authority in the States would be absolutely and totally
 CONTRADICTORY and REPUGNANT. I use these terms to distinguish this
 last case from another which might appear to resemble it, but which
 would, in fact, be essentially different; I mean where the exercise
 of a concurrent jurisdiction might be productive of occasional
 interferences in the POLICY of any branch of administration, but
 would not imply any direct contradiction or repugnancy in point of
 constitutional authority. These three cases of exclusive
 jurisdiction in the federal government may be exemplified by the
 following instances: The last clause but one in the eighth section
 of the first article provides expressly that Congress shall exercise
 ``EXCLUSIVE LEGISLATION'' over the district to be appropriated as
 the seat of government. This answers to the first case. The first
 clause of the same section empowers Congress ``TO LAY AND COLLECT
 TAXES, DUTIES, IMPOSTS AND EXCISES''; and the second clause of the
 tenth section of the same article declares that, ``NO STATE SHALL,
 without the consent of Congress, LAY ANY IMPOSTS OR DUTIES ON
 IMPORTS OR EXPORTS, except for the purpose of executing its
 inspection laws.'' Hence would result an exclusive power in the
 Union to lay duties on imports and exports, with the particular
 exception mentioned; but this power is abridged by another clause,
 which declares that no tax or duty shall be laid on articles
 exported from any State; in consequence of which qualification, it
 now only extends to the DUTIES ON IMPORTS. This answers to the
 second case. The third will be found in that clause which declares
 that Congress shall have power ``to establish an UNIFORM RULE of
 naturalization throughout the United States.'' This must
 necessarily be exclusive; because if each State had power to
 prescribe a DISTINCT RULE, there could not be a UNIFORM RULE.
A case which may perhaps be thought to resemble the latter, but
 which is in fact widely different, affects the question immediately
 under consideration. I mean the power of imposing taxes on all
 articles other than exports and imports. This, I contend, is
 manifestly a concurrent and coequal authority in the United States
 and in the individual States. There is plainly no expression in the
 granting clause which makes that power EXCLUSIVE in the Union.
 There is no independent clause or sentence which prohibits the
 States from exercising it. So far is this from being the case, that
 a plain and conclusive argument to the contrary is to be deduced
 from the restraint laid upon the States in relation to duties on
 imports and exports. This restriction implies an admission that, if
 it were not inserted, the States would possess the power it
 excludes; and it implies a further admission, that as to all other
 taxes, the authority of the States remains undiminished. In any
 other view it would be both unnecessary and dangerous; it would be
 unnecessary, because if the grant to the Union of the power of
 laying such duties implied the exclusion of the States, or even
 their subordination in this particular, there could be no need of
 such a restriction; it would be dangerous, because the introduction
 of it leads directly to the conclusion which has been mentioned, and
 which, if the reasoning of the objectors be just, could not have
 been intended; I mean that the States, in all cases to which the
 restriction did not apply, would have a concurrent power of taxation
 with the Union. The restriction in question amounts to what lawyers
 call a NEGATIVE PREGNANT that is, a NEGATION of one thing, and an
 AFFIRMANCE of another; a negation of the authority of the States to
 impose taxes on imports and exports, and an affirmance of their
 authority to impose them on all other articles. It would be mere
 sophistry to argue that it was meant to exclude them ABSOLUTELY from
 the imposition of taxes of the former kind, and to leave them at
 liberty to lay others SUBJECT TO THE CONTROL of the national
 legislature. The restraining or prohibitory clause only says, that
 they shall not, WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF CONGRESS, lay such duties;
 and if we are to understand this in the sense last mentioned, the
 Constitution would then be made to introduce a formal provision for
 the sake of a very absurd conclusion; which is, that the States,
 WITH THE CONSENT of the national legislature, might tax imports and
 exports; and that they might tax every other article, UNLESS
 CONTROLLED by the same body. If this was the intention, why not
 leave it, in the first instance, to what is alleged to be the
 natural operation of the original clause, conferring a general power
 of taxation upon the Union? It is evident that this could not have
 been the intention, and that it will not bear a construction of the
 kind.
As to a supposition of repugnancy between the power of taxation
 in the States and in the Union, it cannot be supported in that sense
 which would be requisite to work an exclusion of the States. It is,
 indeed, possible that a tax might be laid on a particular article by
 a State which might render it INEXPEDIENT that thus a further tax
 should be laid on the same article by the Union; but it would not
 imply a constitutional inability to impose a further tax. The
 quantity of the imposition, the expediency or inexpediency of an
 increase on either side, would be mutually questions of prudence;
 but there would be involved no direct contradiction of power. The
 particular policy of the national and of the State systems of
 finance might now and then not exactly coincide, and might require
 reciprocal forbearances. It is not, however a mere possibility of
 inconvenience in the exercise of powers, but an immediate
 constitutional repugnancy that can by implication alienate and
 extinguish a pre-existing right of sovereignty.
The necessity of a concurrent jurisdiction in certain cases
 results from the division of the sovereign power; and the rule that
 all authorities, of which the States are not explicitly divested in
 favor of the Union, remain with them in full vigor, is not a
 theoretical consequence of that division, but is clearly admitted by
 the whole tenor of the instrument which contains the articles of the
 proposed Constitution. We there find that, notwithstanding the
 affirmative grants of general authorities, there has been the most
 pointed care in those cases where it was deemed improper that the
 like authorities should reside in the States, to insert negative
 clauses prohibiting the exercise of them by the States. The tenth
 section of the first article consists altogether of such provisions.
 This circumstance is a clear indication of the sense of the
 convention, and furnishes a rule of interpretation out of the body
 of the act, which justifies the position I have advanced and refutes
 every hypothesis to the contrary.

From the Daily Advertiser.
January 3, 1788.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
THE residue of the argument against the provisions of the
 Constitution in respect to taxation is ingrafted upon the following
 clause. The last clause of the eighth section of the first article
 of the plan under consideration authorizes the national legislature
 ``to make all laws which shall be NECESSARY and PROPER for carrying
 into execution THE POWERS by that Constitution vested in the
 government of the United States, or in any department or officer
 thereof''; and the second clause of the sixth article declares,
 ``that the Constitution and the laws of the United States made IN
 PURSUANCE THEREOF, and the treaties made by their authority shall be
 the SUPREME LAW of the land, any thing in the constitution or laws
 of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.''
These two clauses have been the source of much virulent
 invective and petulant declamation against the proposed Constitution.
 They have been held up to the people in all the exaggerated colors
 of misrepresentation as the pernicious engines by which their local
 governments were to be destroyed and their liberties exterminated;
 as the hideous monster whose devouring jaws would spare neither sex
 nor age, nor high nor low, nor sacred nor profane; and yet, strange
 as it may appear, after all this clamor, to those who may not have
 happened to contemplate them in the same light, it may be affirmed
 with perfect confidence that the constitutional operation of the
 intended government would be precisely the same, if these clauses
 were entirely obliterated, as if they were repeated in every article.
 They are only declaratory of a truth which would have resulted by
 necessary and unavoidable implication from the very act of
 constituting a federal government, and vesting it with certain
 specified powers. This is so clear a proposition, that moderation
 itself can scarcely listen to the railings which have been so
 copiously vented against this part of the plan, without emotions
 that disturb its equanimity.
What is a power, but the ability or faculty of doing a thing?
 What is the ability to do a thing, but the power of employing the
 MEANS necessary to its execution? What is a LEGISLATIVE power, but
 a power of making LAWS? What are the MEANS to execute a LEGISLATIVE
 power but LAWS? What is the power of laying and collecting taxes,
 but a LEGISLATIVE POWER, or a power of MAKING LAWS, to lay and
 collect taxes? What are the propermeans of executing such a power,
 but NECESSARY and PROPER laws?
This simple train of inquiry furnishes us at once with a test by
 which to judge of the true nature of the clause complained of. It
 conducts us to this palpable truth, that a power to lay and collect
 taxes must be a power to pass all laws NECESSARY and PROPER for the
 execution of that power; and what does the unfortunate and
 culumniated provision in question do more than declare the same
 truth, to wit, that the national legislature, to whom the power of
 laying and collecting taxes had been previously given, might, in the
 execution of that power, pass all laws NECESSARY and PROPER to carry
 it into effect? I have applied these observations thus particularly
 to the power of taxation, because it is the immediate subject under
 consideration, and because it is the most important of the
 authorities proposed to be conferred upon the Union. But the same
 process will lead to the same result, in relation to all other
 powers declared in the Constitution. And it is EXPRESSLY to execute
 these powers that the sweeping clause, as it has been affectedly
 called, authorizes the national legislature to pass all NECESSARY
 and PROPER laws. If there is any thing exceptionable, it must be
 sought for in the specific powers upon which this general
 declaration is predicated. The declaration itself, though it may be
 chargeable with tautology or redundancy, is at least perfectly
 harmless.
But SUSPICION may ask, Why then was it introduced? The answer
 is, that it could only have been done for greater caution, and to
 guard against all cavilling refinements in those who might hereafter
 feel a disposition to curtail and evade the legitimatb authorities
 of the Union. The Convention probably foresaw, what it has been a
 principal aim of these papers to inculcate, that the danger which
 most threatens our political welfare is that the State governments
 will finally sap the foundations of the Union; and might therefore
 think it necessary, in so cardinal a point, to leave nothing to
 construction. Whatever may have been the inducement to it, the
 wisdom of the precaution is evident from the cry which has been
 raised against it; as that very cry betrays a disposition to
 question the great and essential truth which it is manifestly the
 object of that provision to declare.
But it may be again asked, Who is to judge of the NECESSITY and
 PROPRIETY of the laws to be passed for executing the powers of the
 Union? I answer, first, that this question arises as well and as
 fully upon the simple grant of those powers as upon the declaratory
 clause; and I answer, in the second place, that the national
 government, like every other, must judge, in the first instance, of
 the proper exercise of its powers, and its constituents in the last.
 If the federal government should overpass the just bounds of its
 authority and make a tyrannical use of its powers, the people, whose
 creature it is, must appeal to the standard they have formed, and
 take such measures to redress the injury done to the Constitution as
 the exigency may suggest and prudence justify. The propriety of a
 law, in a constitutional light, must always be determined by the
 nature of the powers upon which it is founded. Suppose, by some
 forced constructions of its authority (which, indeed, cannot easily
 be imagined), the Federal legislature should attempt to vary the law
 of descent in any State, would it not be evident that, in making
 such an attempt, it had exceeded its jurisdiction, and infringed
 upon that of the State? Suppose, again, that upon the pretense of
 an interference with its revenues, it should undertake to abrogate a
 landtax imposed by the authority of a State; would it not be
 equally evident that this was an invasion of that concurrent
 jurisdiction in respect to this species of tax, which its
 Constitution plainly supposes to exist in the State governments? If
 there ever should be a doubt on this head, the credit of it will be
 entirely due to those reasoners who, in the imprudent zeal of their
 animosity to the plan of the convention, have labored to envelop it
 in a cloud calculated to obscure the plainest and simplest truths.
But it is said that the laws of the Union are to be the SUPREME
 LAW of the land. But what inference can be drawn from this, or what
 would they amount to, if they were not to be supreme? It is evident
 they would amount to nothing. A LAW, by the very meaning of the
 term, includes supremacy. It is a rule which those to whom it is
 prescribed are bound to observe. This results from every political
 association. If individuals enter into a state of society, the laws
 of that society must be the supreme regulator of their conduct. If
 a number of political societies enter into a larger political
 society, the laws which the latter may enact, pursuant to the powers
 intrusted to it by its constitution, must necessarily be supreme
 over those societies, and the individuals of whom they are composed.
 It would otherwise be a mere treaty, dependent on the good faith of
 the parties, and not a goverment, which is only another word for
 POLITICAL POWER AND SUPREMACY. But it will not follow from this
 doctrine that acts of the large society which are NOT PURSUANT to
 its constitutional powers, but which are invasions of the residuary
 authorities of the smaller societies, will become the supreme law of
 the land. These will be merely acts of usurpation, and will deserve
 to be treated as such. Hence we perceive that the clause which
 declares the supremacy of the laws of the Union, like the one we
 have just before considered, only declares a truth, which flows
 immediately and necessarily from the institution of a federal
 government. It will not, I presume, have escaped observation, that
 it EXPRESSLY confines this supremacy to laws made PURSUANT TO THE
 CONSTITUTION; which I mention merely as an instance of caution in
 the convention; since that limitation would have been to be
 understood, though it had not been expressed.
Though a law, therefore, laying a tax for the use of the United
 States would be supreme in its nature, and could not legally be
 opposed or controlled, yet a law for abrogating or preventing the
 collection of a tax laid by the authority of the State, (unless upon
 imports and exports), would not be the supreme law of the land, but
 a usurpation of power not granted by the Constitution. As far as an
 improper accumulation of taxes on the same object might tend to
 render the collection difficult or precarious, this would be a
 mutual inconvenience, not arising from a superiority or defect of
 power on either side, but from an injudicious exercise of power by
 one or the other, in a manner equally disadvantageous to both. It
 is to be hoped and presumed, however, that mutual interest would
 dictate a concert in this respect which would avoid any material
 inconvenience. The inference from the whole is, that the individual
 States would, under the proposed Constitution, retain an independent
 and uncontrollable authority to raise revenue to any extent of which
 they may stand in need, by every kind of taxation, except duties on
 imports and exports. It will be shown in the next paper that this
 CONCURRENT JURISDICTION in the article of taxation was the only
 admissible substitute for an entire subordination, in respect to
 this branch of power, of the State authority to that of the Union.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
I FLATTER myself it has been clearly shown in my last number
 that the particular States, under the proposed Constitution, would
 have COEQUAL authority with the Union in the article of revenue,
 except as to duties on imports. As this leaves open to the States
 far the greatest part of the resources of the community, there can
 be no color for the assertion that they would not possess means as
 abundant as could be desired for the supply of their own wants,
 independent of all external control. That the field is sufficiently
 wide will more fully appear when we come to advert to the
 inconsiderable share of the public expenses for which it will fall
 to the lot of the State governments to provide.
To argue upon abstract principles that this co-ordinate
 authority cannot exist, is to set up supposition and theory against
 fact and reality. However proper such reasonings might be to show
 that a thing OUGHT NOT TO EXIST, they are wholly to be rejected when
 they are made use of to prove that it does not exist contrary to the
 evidence of the fact itself. It is well known that in the Roman
 republic the legislative authority, in the last resort, resided for
 ages in two different political bodies not as branches of the same
 legislature, but as distinct and independent legislatures, in each
 of which an opposite interest prevailed: in one the patrician; in
 the other, the plebian. Many arguments might have been adduced to
 prove the unfitness of two such seemingly contradictory authorities,
 each having power to ANNUL or REPEAL the acts of the other. But a
 man would have been regarded as frantic who should have attempted at
 Rome to disprove their existence. It will be readily understood
 that I allude to the COMITIA CENTURIATA and the COMITIA TRIBUTA.
 The former, in which the people voted by centuries, was so arranged
 as to give a superiority to the patrician interest; in the latter,
 in which numbers prevailed, the plebian interest had an entire
 predominancy. And yet these two legislatures coexisted for ages,
 and the Roman republic attained to the utmost height of human
 greatness.
In the case particularly under consideration, there is no such
 contradiction as appears in the example cited; there is no power on
 either side to annul the acts of the other. And in practice there
 is little reason to apprehend any inconvenience; because, in a
 short course of time, the wants of the States will naturally reduce
 themselves within A VERY NARROW COMPASS; and in the interim, the
 United States will, in all probability, find it convenient to
 abstain wholly from those objects to which the particular States
 would be inclined to resort.
To form a more precise judgment of the true merits of this
 question, it will be well to advert to the proportion between the
 objects that will require a federal provision in respect to revenue,
 and those which will require a State provision. We shall discover
 that the former are altogether unlimited, and that the latter are
 circumscribed within very moderate bounds. In pursuing this
 inquiry, we must bear in mind that we are not to confine our view to
 the present period, but to look forward to remote futurity.
 Constitutions of civil government are not to be framed upon a
 calculation of existing exigencies, but upon a combination of these
 with the probable exigencies of ages, according to the natural and
 tried course of human affairs. Nothing, therefore, can be more
 fallacious than to infer the extent of any power, proper to be
 lodged in the national government, from an estimate of its immediate
 necessities. There ought to be a CAPACITY to provide for future
 contingencies as they may happen; and as these are illimitable in
 their nature, it is impossible safely to limit that capacity. It is
 true, perhaps, that a computation might be made with sufficient
 accuracy to answer the purpose of the quantity of revenue requisite
 to discharge the subsisting engagements of the Union, and to
 maintain those establishments which, for some time to come, would
 suffice in time of peace. But would it be wise, or would it not
 rather be the extreme of folly, to stop at this point, and to leave
 the government intrusted with the care of the national defense in a
 state of absolute incapacity to provide for the protection of the
 community against future invasions of the public peace, by foreign
 war or domestic convulsions? If, on the contrary, we ought to
 exceed this point, where can we stop, short of an indefinite power
 of providing for emergencies as they may arise? Though it is easy
 to assert, in general terms, the possibility of forming a rational
 judgment of a due provision against probable dangers, yet we may
 safely challenge those who make the assertion to bring forward their
 data, and may affirm that they would be found as vague and uncertain
 as any that could be produced to establish the probable duration of
 the world. Observations confined to the mere prospects of internal
 attacks can deserve no weight; though even these will admit of no
 satisfactory calculation: but if we mean to be a commercial people,
 it must form a part of our policy to be able one day to defend that
 commerce. The support of a navy and of naval wars would involve
 contingencies that must baffle all the efforts of political
 arithmetic.
Admitting that we ought to try the novel and absurd experiment
 in politics of tying up the hands of government from offensive war
 founded upon reasons of state, yet certainly we ought not to disable
 it from guarding the community against the ambition or enmity of
 other nations. A cloud has been for some time hanging over the
 European world. If it should break forth into a storm, who can
 insure us that in its progress a part of its fury would not be spent
 upon us? No reasonable man would hastily pronounce that we are
 entirely out of its reach. Or if the combustible materials that now
 seem to be collecting should be dissipated without coming to
 maturity, or if a flame should be kindled without extending to us,
 what security can we have that our tranquillity will long remain
 undisturbed from some other cause or from some other quarter? Let
 us recollect that peace or war will not always be left to our
 option; that however moderate or unambitious we may be, we cannot
 count upon the moderation, or hope to extinguish the ambition of
 others. Who could have imagined at the conclusion of the last war
 that France and Britain, wearied and exhausted as they both were,
 would so soon have looked with so hostile an aspect upon each other?
 To judge from the history of mankind, we shall be compelled to
 conclude that the fiery and destructive passions of war reign in the
 human breast with much more powerful sway than the mild and
 beneficent sentiments of peace; and that to model our political
 systems upon speculations of lasting tranquillity, is to calculate
 on the weaker springs of the human character.
What are the chief sources of expense in every government? What
 has occasioned that enormous accumulation of debts with which
 several of the European nations are oppressed? The answers plainly
 is, wars and rebellions; the support of those institutions which
 are necessary to guard the body politic against these two most
 mortal diseases of society. The expenses arising from those
 institutions which are relative to the mere domestic police of a
 state, to the support of its legislative, executive, and judicial
 departments, with their different appendages, and to the
 encouragement of agriculture and manufactures (which will comprehend
 almost all the objects of state expenditure), are insignificant in
 comparison with those which relate to the national defense.
In the kingdom of Great Britain, where all the ostentatious
 apparatus of monarchy is to be provided for, not above a fifteenth
 part of the annual income of the nation is appropriated to the class
 of expenses last mentioned; the other fourteen fifteenths are
 absorbed in the payment of the interest of debts contracted for
 carrying on the wars in which that country has been engaged, and in
 the maintenance of fleets and armies. If, on the one hand, it
 should be observed that the expenses incurred in the prosecution of
 the ambitious enterprises and vainglorious pursuits of a monarchy
 are not a proper standard by which to judge of those which might be
 necessary in a republic, it ought, on the other hand, to be remarked
 that there should be as great a disproportion between the profusion
 and extravagance of a wealthy kingdom in its domestic
 administration, and the frugality and economy which in that
 particular become the modest simplicity of republican government.
 If we balance a proper deduction from one side against that which
 it is supposed ought to be made from the other, the proportion may
 still be considered as holding good.
But let us advert to the large debt which we have ourselves
 contracted in a single war, and let us only calculate on a common
 share of the events which disturb the peace of nations, and we shall
 instantly perceive, without the aid of any elaborate illustration,
 that there must always be an immense disproportion between the
 objects of federal and state expenditures. It is true that several
 of the States, separately, are encumbered with considerable debts,
 which are an excrescence of the late war. But this cannot happen
 again, if the proposed system be adopted; and when these debts are
 discharged, the only call for revenue of any consequence, which the
 State governments will continue to experience, will be for the mere
 support of their respective civil list; to which, if we add all
 contingencies, the total amount in every State ought to fall
 considerably short of two hundred thousand pounds.
In framing a government for posterity as well as ourselves, we
 ought, in those provisions which are designed to be permanent, to
 calculate, not on temporary, but on permanent causes of expense. If
 this principle be a just one our attention would be directed to a
 provision in favor of the State governments for an annual sum of
 about two hundred thousand pounds; while the exigencies of the
 Union could be susceptible of no limits, even in imagination. In
 this view of the subject, by what logic can it be maintained that
 the local governments ought to command, in perpetuity, an EXCLUSIVE
 source of revenue for any sum beyond the extent of two hundred
 thousand pounds? To extend its power further, in EXCLUSION of the
 authority of the Union, would be to take the resources of the
 community out of those hands which stood in need of them for the
 public welfare, in order to put them into other hands which could
 have no just or proper occasion for them.
Suppose, then, the convention had been inclined to proceed upon
 the principle of a repartition of the objects of revenue, between
 the Union and its members, in PROPORTION to their comparative
 necessities; what particular fund could have been selected for the
 use of the States, that would not either have been too much or too
 little too little for their present, too much for their future
 wants? As to the line of separation between external and internal
 taxes, this would leave to the States, at a rough computation, the
 command of two thirds of the resources of the community to defray
 from a tenth to a twentieth part of its expenses; and to the Union,
 one third of the resources of the community, to defray from nine
 tenths to nineteen twentieths of its expenses. If we desert this
 boundary and content ourselves with leaving to the States an
 exclusive power of taxing houses and lands, there would still be a
 great disproportion between the MEANS and the END; the possession
 of one third of the resources of the community to supply, at most,
 one tenth of its wants. If any fund could have been selected and
 appropriated, equal to and not greater than the object, it would
 have been inadequate to the discharge of the existing debts of the
 particular States, and would have left them dependent on the Union
 for a provision for this purpose.
The preceding train of observation will justify the position
 which has been elsewhere laid down, that ``A CONCURRENT JURISDICTION
 in the article of taxation was the only admissible substitute for an
 entire subordination, in respect to this branch of power, of State
 authority to that of the Union.'' Any separation of the objects of
 revenue that could have been fallen upon, would have amounted to a
 sacrifice of the great INTERESTS of the Union to the POWER of the
 individual States. The convention thought the concurrent
 jurisdiction preferable to that subordination; and it is evident
 that it has at least the merit of reconciling an indefinite
 constitutional power of taxation in the Federal government with an
 adequate and independent power in the States to provide for their
 own necessities. There remain a few other lights, in which this
 important subject of taxation will claim a further consideration.
PUBLIUS.

The Same Subject Continued
(Concerning the General Power of Taxation)
For the Independent Journal.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
BEFORE we proceed to examine any other objections to an
 indefinite power of taxation in the Union, I shall make one general
 remark; which is, that if the jurisdiction of the national
 government, in the article of revenue, should be restricted to
 particular objects, it would naturally occasion an undue proportion
 of the public burdens to fall upon those objects. Two evils would
 spring from this source: the oppression of particular branches of
 industry; and an unequal distribution of the taxes, as well among
 the several States as among the citizens of the same State.
Suppose, as has been contended for, the federal power of
 taxation were to be confined to duties on imports, it is evident
 that the government, for want of being able to command other
 resources, would frequently be tempted to extend these duties to an
 injurious excess. There are persons who imagine that they can never
 be carried to too great a length; since the higher they are, the
 more it is alleged they will tend to discourage an extravagant
 consumption, to produce a favorable balance of trade, and to promote
 domestic manufactures. But all extremes are pernicious in various
 ways. Exorbitant duties on imported articles would beget a general
 spirit of smuggling; which is always prejudicial to the fair
 trader, and eventually to the revenue itself: they tend to render
 other classes of the community tributary, in an improper degree, to
 the manufacturing classes, to whom they give a premature monopoly of
 the markets; they sometimes force industry out of its more natural
 channels into others in which it flows with less advantage; and in
 the last place, they oppress the merchant, who is often obliged to
 pay them himself without any retribution from the consumer. When
 the demand is equal to the quantity of goods at market, the consumer
 generally pays the duty; but when the markets happen to be
 overstocked, a great proportion falls upon the merchant, and
 sometimes not only exhausts his profits, but breaks in upon his
 capital. I am apt to think that a division of the duty, between the
 seller and the buyer, more often happens than is commonly imagined.
 It is not always possible to raise the price of a commodity in
 exact proportion to every additional imposition laid upon it. The
 merchant, especially in a country of small commercial capital, is
 often under a necessity of keeping prices down in order to a more
 expeditious sale.
The maxim that the consumer is the payer, is so much oftener
 true than the reverse of the proposition, that it is far more
 equitable that the duties on imports should go into a common stock,
 than that they should redound to the exclusive benefit of the
 importing States. But it is not so generally true as to render it
 equitable, that those duties should form the only national fund.
 When they are paid by the merchant they operate as an additional
 tax upon the importing State, whose citizens pay their proportion of
 them in the character of consumers. In this view they are
 productive of inequality among the States; which inequality would
 be increased with the increased extent of the duties. The
 confinement of the national revenues to this species of imposts
 would be attended with inequality, from a different cause, between
 the manufacturing and the non-manufacturing States. The States
 which can go farthest towards the supply of their own wants, by
 their own manufactures, will not, according to their numbers or
 wealth, consume so great a proportion of imported articles as those
 States which are not in the same favorable situation. They would
 not, therefore, in this mode alone contribute to the public treasury
 in a ratio to their abilities. To make them do this it is necessary
 that recourse be had to excises, the proper objects of which are
 particular kinds of manufactures. New York is more deeply
 interested in these considerations than such of her citizens as
 contend for limiting the power of the Union to external taxation may
 be aware of. New York is an importing State, and is not likely
 speedily to be, to any great extent, a manufacturing State. She
 would, of course, suffer in a double light from restraining the
 jurisdiction of the Union to commercial imposts.
So far as these observations tend to inculcate a danger of the
 import duties being extended to an injurious extreme it may be
 observed, conformably to a remark made in another part of these
 papers, that the interest of the revenue itself would be a
 sufficient guard against such an extreme. I readily admit that this
 would be the case, as long as other resources were open; but if the
 avenues to them were closed, HOPE, stimulated by necessity, would
 beget experiments, fortified by rigorous precautions and additional
 penalties, which, for a time, would have the intended effect, till
 there had been leisure to contrive expedients to elude these new
 precautions. The first success would be apt to inspire false
 opinions, which it might require a long course of subsequent
 experience to correct. Necessity, especially in politics, often
 occasions false hopes, false reasonings, and a system of measures
 correspondingly erroneous. But even if this supposed excess should
 not be a consequence of the limitation of the federal power of
 taxation, the inequalities spoken of would still ensue, though not
 in the same degree, from the other causes that have been noticed.
 Let us now return to the examination of objections.
One which, if we may judge from the frequency of its repetition,
 seems most to be relied on, is, that the House of Representatives is
 not sufficiently numerous for the reception of all the different
 classes of citizens, in order to combine the interests and feelings
 of every part of the community, and to produce a due sympathy
 between the representative body and its constituents. This argument
 presents itself under a very specious and seducing form; and is
 well calculated to lay hold of the prejudices of those to whom it is
 addressed. But when we come to dissect it with attention, it will
 appear to be made up of nothing but fair-sounding words. The object
 it seems to aim at is, in the first place, impracticable, and in the
 sense in which it is contended for, is unnecessary. I reserve for
 another place the discussion of the question which relates to the
 sufficiency of the representative body in respect to numbers, and
 shall content myself with examining here the particular use which
 has been made of a contrary supposition, in reference to the
 immediate subject of our inquiries.
The idea of an actual representation of all classes of the
 people, by persons of each class, is altogether visionary. Unless
 it were expressly provided in the Constitution, that each different
 occupation should send one or more members, the thing would never
 take place in practice. Mechanics and manufacturers will always be
 inclined, with few exceptions, to give their votes to merchants, in
 preference to persons of their own professions or trades. Those
 discerning citizens are well aware that the mechanic and
 manufacturing arts furnish the materials of mercantile enterprise
 and industry. Many of them, indeed, are immediately connected with
 the operations of commerce. They know that the merchant is their
 natural patron and friend; and they are aware, that however great
 the confidence they may justly feel in their own good sense, their
 interests can be more effectually promoted by the merchant than by
 themselves. They are sensible that their habits in life have not
 been such as to give them those acquired endowments, without which,
 in a deliberative assembly, the greatest natural abilities are for
 the most part useless; and that the influence and weight, and
 superior acquirements of the merchants render them more equal to a
 contest with any spirit which might happen to infuse itself into the
 public councils, unfriendly to the manufacturing and trading
 interests. These considerations, and many others that might be
 mentioned prove, and experience confirms it, that artisans and
 manufacturers will commonly be disposed to bestow their votes upon
 merchants and those whom they recommend. We must therefore consider
 merchants as the natural representatives of all these classes of the
 community.
With regard to the learned professions, little need be observed;
 they truly form no distinct interest in society, and according to
 their situation and talents, will be indiscriminately the objects of
 the confidence and choice of each other, and of other parts of the
 community.
Nothing remains but the landed interest; and this, in a
 political view, and particularly in relation to taxes, I take to be
 perfectly united, from the wealthiest landlord down to the poorest
 tenant. No tax can be laid on land which will not affect the
 proprietor of millions of acres as well as the proprietor of a
 single acre. Every landholder will therefore have a common interest
 to keep the taxes on land as low as possible; and common interest
 may always be reckoned upon as the surest bond of sympathy. But if
 we even could suppose a distinction of interest between the opulent
 landholder and the middling farmer, what reason is there to
 conclude, that the first would stand a better chance of being
 deputed to the national legislature than the last? If we take fact
 as our guide, and look into our own senate and assembly, we shall
 find that moderate proprietors of land prevail in both; nor is this
 less the case in the senate, which consists of a smaller number,
 than in the assembly, which is composed of a greater number. Where
 the qualifications of the electors are the same, whether they have
 to choose a small or a large number, their votes will fall upon
 those in whom they have most confidence; whether these happen to be
 men of large fortunes, or of moderate property, or of no property at
 all.
It is said to be necessary, that all classes of citizens should
 have some of their own number in the representative body, in order
 that their feelings and interests may be the better understood and
 attended to. But we have seen that this will never happen under any
 arrangement that leaves the votes of the people free. Where this is
 the case, the representative body, with too few exceptions to have
 any influence on the spirit of the government, will be composed of
 landholders, merchants, and men of the learned professions. But
 where is the danger that the interests and feelings of the different
 classes of citizens will not be understood or attended to by these
 three descriptions of men? Will not the landholder know and feel
 whatever will promote or insure the interest of landed property?
 And will he not, from his own interest in that species of property,
 be sufficiently prone to resist every attempt to prejudice or
 encumber it? Will not the merchant understand and be disposed to
 cultivate, as far as may be proper, the interests of the mechanic
 and manufacturing arts, to which his commerce is so nearly allied?
 Will not the man of the learned profession, who will feel a
 neutrality to the rivalships between the different branches of
 industry, be likely to prove an impartial arbiter between them,
 ready to promote either, so far as it shall appear to him conducive
 to the general interests of the society?
If we take into the account the momentary humors or dispositions
 which may happen to prevail in particular parts of the society, and
 to which a wise administration will never be inattentive, is the man
 whose situation leads to extensive inquiry and information less
 likely to be a competent judge of their nature, extent, and
 foundation than one whose observation does not travel beyond the
 circle of his neighbors and acquaintances? Is it not natural that a
 man who is a candidate for the favor of the people, and who is
 dependent on the suffrages of his fellow-citizens for the
 continuance of his public honors, should take care to inform himself
 of their dispositions and inclinations, and should be willing to
 allow them their proper degree of influence upon his conduct? This
 dependence, and the necessity of being bound himself, and his
 posterity, by the laws to which he gives his assent, are the true,
 and they are the strong chords of sympathy between the
 representative and the constituent.
There is no part of the administration of government that
 requires extensive information and a thorough knowledge of the
 principles of political economy, so much as the business of taxation.
 The man who understands those principles best will be least likely
 to resort to oppressive expedients, or sacrifice any particular
 class of citizens to the procurement of revenue. It might be
 demonstrated that the most productive system of finance will always
 be the least burdensome. There can be no doubt that in order to a
 judicious exercise of the power of taxation, it is necessary that
 the person in whose hands it should be acquainted with the general
 genius, habits, and modes of thinking of the people at large, and
 with the resources of the country. And this is all that can be
 reasonably meant by a knowledge of the interests and feelings of the
 people. In any other sense the proposition has either no meaning,
 or an absurd one. And in that sense let every considerate citizen
 judge for himself where the requisite qualification is most likely
 to be found.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
WE HAVE seen that the result of the observations, to which the
 foregoing number has been principally devoted, is, that from the
 natural operation of the different interests and views of the
 various classes of the community, whether the representation of the
 people be more or less numerous, it will consist almost entirely of
 proprietors of land, of merchants, and of members of the learned
 professions, who will truly represent all those different interests
 and views. If it should be objected that we have seen other
 descriptions of men in the local legislatures, I answer that it is
 admitted there are exceptions to the rule, but not in sufficient
 number to influence the general complexion or character of the
 government. There are strong minds in every walk of life that will
 rise superior to the disadvantages of situation, and will command
 the tribute due to their merit, not only from the classes to which
 they particularly belong, but from the society in general. The door
 ought to be equally open to all; and I trust, for the credit of
 human nature, that we shall see examples of such vigorous plants
 flourishing in the soil of federal as well as of State legislation;
 but occasional instances of this sort will not render the reasoning
 founded upon the general course of things, less conclusive.
The subject might be placed in several other lights that would
 all lead to the same result; and in particular it might be asked,
 What greater affinity or relation of interest can be conceived
 between the carpenter and blacksmith, and the linen manufacturer or
 stocking weaver, than between the merchant and either of them? It
 is notorious that there are often as great rivalships between
 different branches of the mechanic or manufacturing arts as there
 are between any of the departments of labor and industry; so that,
 unless the representative body were to be far more numerous than
 would be consistent with any idea of regularity or wisdom in its
 deliberations, it is impossible that what seems to be the spirit of
 the objection we have been considering should ever be realized in
 practice. But I forbear to dwell any longer on a matter which has
 hitherto worn too loose a garb to admit even of an accurate
 inspection of its real shape or tendency.
There is another objection of a somewhat more precise nature
 that claims our attention. It has been asserted that a power of
 internal taxation in the national legislature could never be
 exercised with advantage, as well from the want of a sufficient
 knowledge of local circumstances, as from an interference between
 the revenue laws of the Union and of the particular States. The
 supposition of a want of proper knowledge seems to be entirely
 destitute of foundation. If any question is depending in a State
 legislature respecting one of the counties, which demands a
 knowledge of local details, how is it acquired? No doubt from the
 information of the members of the county. Cannot the like knowledge
 be obtained in the national legislature from the representatives of
 each State? And is it not to be presumed that the men who will
 generally be sent there will be possessed of the necessary degree of
 intelligence to be able to communicate that information? Is the
 knowledge of local circumstances, as applied to taxation, a minute
 topographical acquaintance with all the mountains, rivers, streams,
 highways, and bypaths in each State; or is it a general
 acquaintance with its situation and resources, with the state of its
 agriculture, commerce, manufactures, with the nature of its products
 and consumptions, with the different degrees and kinds of its
 wealth, property, and industry?
Nations in general, even under governments of the more popular
 kind, usually commit the administration of their finances to single
 men or to boards composed of a few individuals, who digest and
 prepare, in the first instance, the plans of taxation, which are
 afterwards passed into laws by the authority of the sovereign or
 legislature.
Inquisitive and enlightened statesmen are deemed everywhere best
 qualified to make a judicious selection of the objects proper for
 revenue; which is a clear indication, as far as the sense of
 mankind can have weight in the question, of the species of knowledge
 of local circumstances requisite to the purposes of taxation.
The taxes intended to be comprised under the general
 denomination of internal taxes may be subdivided into those of the
 DIRECT and those of the INDIRECT kind. Though the objection be made
 to both, yet the reasoning upon it seems to be confined to the
 former branch. And indeed, as to the latter, by which must be
 understood duties and excises on articles of consumption, one is at
 a loss to conceive what can be the nature of the difficulties
 apprehended. The knowledge relating to them must evidently be of a
 kind that will either be suggested by the nature of the article
 itself, or can easily be procured from any well-informed man,
 especially of the mercantile class. The circumstances that may
 distinguish its situation in one State from its situation in another
 must be few, simple, and easy to be comprehended. The principal
 thing to be attended to, would be to avoid those articles which had
 been previously appropriated to the use of a particular State; and
 there could be no difficulty in ascertaining the revenue system of
 each. This could always be known from the respective codes of laws,
 as well as from the information of the members from the several
 States.
The objection, when applied to real property or to houses and
 lands, appears to have, at first sight, more foundation, but even in
 this view it will not bear a close examination. Land taxes are co
 monly laid in one of two modes, either by ACTUAL valuations,
 permanent or periodical, or by OCCASIONAL assessments, at the
 discretion, or according to the best judgment, of certain officers
 whose duty it is to make them. In either case, the EXECUTION of the
 business, which alone requires the knowledge of local details, must
 be devolved upon discreet persons in the character of commissioners
 or assessors, elected by the people or appointed by the government
 for the purpose. All that the law can do must be to name the
 persons or to prescribe the manner of their election or appointment,
 to fix their numbers and qualifications and to draw the general
 outlines of their powers and duties. And what is there in all this
 that cannot as well be performed by the national legislature as by a
 State legislature? The attention of either can only reach to
 general principles; local details, as already observed, must be
 referred to those who are to execute the plan.
But there is a simple point of view in which this matter may be
 placed that must be altogether satisfactory. The national
 legislature can make use of the SYSTEM OF EACH STATE WITHIN THAT
 STATE. The method of laying and collecting this species of taxes in
 each State can, in all its parts, be adopted and employed by the
 federal government.
Let it be recollected that the proportion of these taxes is not
 to be left to the discretion of the national legislature, but is to
 be determined by the numbers of each State, as described in the
 second section of the first article. An actual census or
 enumeration of the people must furnish the rule, a circumstance
 which effectually shuts the door to partiality or oppression. The
 abuse of this power of taxation seems to have been provided against
 with guarded circumspection. In addition to the precaution just
 mentioned, there is a provision that ``all duties, imposts, and
 excises shall be UNIFORM throughout the United States.''
It has been very properly observed by different speakers and
 writers on the side of the Constitution, that if the exercise of the
 power of internal taxation by the Union should be discovered on
 experiment to be really inconvenient, the federal government may
 then forbear the use of it, and have recourse to requisitions in its
 stead. By way of answer to this, it has been triumphantly asked,
 Why not in the first instance omit that ambiguous power, and rely
 upon the latter resource? Two solid answers may be given. The
 first is, that the exercise of that power, if convenient, will be
 preferable, because it will be more effectual; and it is impossible
 to prove in theory, or otherwise than by the experiment, that it
 cannot be advantageously exercised. The contrary, indeed, appears
 most probable. The second answer is, that the existence of such a
 power in the Constitution will have a strong influence in giving
 efficacy to requisitions. When the States know that the Union can
 apply itself without their agency, it will be a powerful motive for
 exertion on their part.
As to the interference of the revenue laws of the Union, and of
 its members, we have already seen that there can be no clashing or
 repugnancy of authority. The laws cannot, therefore, in a legal
 sense, interfere with each other; and it is far from impossible to
 avoid an interference even in the policy of their different systems.
 An effectual expedient for this purpose will be, mutually, to
 abstain from those objects which either side may have first had
 recourse to. As neither can CONTROL the other, each will have an
 obvious and sensible interest in this reciprocal forbearance. And
 where there is an IMMEDIATE common interest, we may safely count
 upon its operation. When the particular debts of the States are
 done away, and their expenses come to be limited within their
 natural compass, the possibility almost of interference will vanish.
 A small land tax will answer the purpose of the States, and will be
 their most simple and most fit resource.
Many spectres have been raised out of this power of internal
 taxation, to excite the apprehensions of the people: double sets of
 revenue officers, a duplication of their burdens by double
 taxations, and the frightful forms of odious and oppressive
 poll-taxes, have been played off with all the ingenious dexterity of
 political legerdemain.
As to the first point, there are two cases in which there can be
 no room for double sets of officers: one, where the right of
 imposing the tax is exclusively vested in the Union, which applies
 to the duties on imports; the other, where the object has not
 fallen under any State regulation or provision, which may be
 applicable to a variety of objects. In other cases, the probability
 is that the United States will either wholly abstain from the
 objects preoccupied for local purposes, or will make use of the
 State officers and State regulations for collecting the additional
 imposition. This will best answer the views of revenue, because it
 will save expense in the collection, and will best avoid any
 occasion of disgust to the State governments and to the people. At
 all events, here is a practicable expedient for avoiding such an
 inconvenience; and nothing more can be required than to show that
 evils predicted to not necessarily result from the plan.
As to any argument derived from a supposed system of influence,
 it is a sufficient answer to say that it ought not to be presumed;
 but the supposition is susceptible of a more precise answer. If
 such a spirit should infest the councils of the Union, the most
 certain road to the accomplishment of its aim would be to employ the
 State officers as much as possible, and to attach them to the Union
 by an accumulation of their emoluments. This would serve to turn
 the tide of State influence into the channels of the national
 government, instead of making federal influence flow in an opposite
 and adverse current. But all suppositions of this kind are
 invidious, and ought to be banished from the consideration of the
 great question before the people. They can answer no other end than
 to cast a mist over the truth.
As to the suggestion of double taxation, the answer is plain.
 The wants of the Union are to be supplied in one way or another;
 if to be done by the authority of the federal government, it will
 not be to be done by that of the State government. The quantity of
 taxes to be paid by the community must be the same in either case;
 with this advantage, if the provision is to be made by the
 Union that the capital resource of commercial imposts, which is the
 most convenient branch of revenue, can be prudently improved to a
 much greater extent under federal than under State regulation, and
 of course will render it less necessary to recur to more
 inconvenient methods; and with this further advantage, that as far
 as there may be any real difficulty in the exercise of the power of
 internal taxation, it will impose a disposition to greater care in
 the choice and arrangement of the means; and must naturally tend to
 make it a fixed point of policy in the national administration to go
 as far as may be practicable in making the luxury of the rich
 tributary to the public treasury, in order to diminish the necessity
 of those impositions which might create dissatisfaction in the
 poorer and most numerous classes of the society. Happy it is when
 the interest which the government has in the preservation of its own
 power, coincides with a proper distribution of the public burdens,
 and tends to guard the least wealthy part of the community from
 oppression!
As to poll taxes, I, without scruple, confess my disapprobation
 of them; and though they have prevailed from an early period in
 those States [1] which have uniformly been the most tenacious of
 their rights, I should lament to see them introduced into practice
 under the national government. But does it follow because there is
 a power to lay them that they will actually be laid? Every State in
 the Union has power to impose taxes of this kind; and yet in
 several of them they are unknown in practice. Are the State
 governments to be stigmatized as tyrannies, because they possess
 this power? If they are not, with what propriety can the like power
 justify such a charge against the national government, or even be
 urged as an obstacle to its adoption? As little friendly as I am to
 the species of imposition, I still feel a thorough conviction that
 the power of having recourse to it ought to exist in the federal
 government. There are certain emergencies of nations, in which
 expedients, that in the ordinary state of things ought to be
 forborne, become essential to the public weal. And the government,
 from the possibility of such emergencies, ought ever to have the
 option of making use of them. The real scarcity of objects in this
 country, which may be considered as productive sources of revenue,
 is a reason peculiar to itself, for not abridging the discretion of
 the national councils in this respect. There may exist certain
 critical and tempestuous conjunctures of the State, in which a poll
 tax may become an inestimable resource. And as I know nothing to
 exempt this portion of the globe from the common calamities that
 have befallen other parts of it, I acknowledge my aversion to every
 project that is calculated to disarm the government of a single
 weapon, which in any possible contingency might be usefully employed
 for the general defense and security.
I have now gone through the examination of such of the powers
 proposed to be vested in the United States, which may be considered
 as having an immediate relation to the energy of the government;
 and have endeavored to answer the principal objections which have
 been made to them. I have passed over in silence those minor
 authorities, which are either too inconsiderable to have been
 thought worthy of the hostilities of the opponents of the
 Constitution, or of too manifest propriety to admit of controversy.
 The mass of judiciary power, however, might have claimed an
 investigation under this head, had it not been for the consideration
 that its organization and its extent may be more advantageously
 considered in connection. This has determined me to refer it to the
 branch of our inquiries upon which we shall next enter.

FEDERALIST No. 37

Concerning the Difficulties of the Convention in Devising a Proper
 Form of Government
From the Daily Advertiser.
Friday, January 11, 1788.

MADISON

To the People of the State of New York:
IN REVIEWING the defects of the existing Confederation, and
 showing that they cannot be supplied by a government of less energy
 than that before the public, several of the most important
 principles of the latter fell of course under consideration. But as
 the ultimate object of these papers is to determine clearly and
 fully the merits of this Constitution, and the expediency of
 adopting it, our plan cannot be complete without taking a more
 critical and thorough survey of the work of the convention, without
 examining it on all its sides, comparing it in all its parts, and
 calculating its probable effects.
That this remaining task may be executed under impressions
 conducive to a just and fair result, some reflections must in this
 place be indulged, which candor previously suggests.
It is a misfortune, inseparable from human affairs, that public
 measures are rarely investigated with that spirit of moderation
 which is essential to a just estimate of their real tendency to
 advance or obstruct the public good; and that this spirit is more
 apt to be diminished than promoted, by those occasions which require
 an unusual exercise of it. To those who have been led by experience
 to attend to this consideration, it could not appear surprising,
 that the act of the convention, which recommends so many important
 changes and innovations, which may be viewed in so many lights and
 relations, and which touches the springs of so many passions and
 interests, should find or excite dispositions unfriendly, both on
 one side and on the other, to a fair discussion and accurate
 judgment of its merits. In some, it has been too evident from their
 own publications, that they have scanned the proposed Constitution,
 not only with a predisposition to censure, but with a
 predetermination to condemn; as the language held by others betrays
 an opposite predetermination or bias, which must render their
 opinions also of little moment in the question. In placing,
 however, these different characters on a level, with respect to the
 weight of their opinions, I wish not to insinuate that there may not
 be a material difference in the purity of their intentions. It is
 but just to remark in favor of the latter description, that as our
 situation is universally admitted to be peculiarly critical, and to
 require indispensably that something should be done for our relief,
 the predetermined patron of what has been actually done may have
 taken his bias from the weight of these considerations, as well as
 from considerations of a sinister nature. The predetermined
 adversary, on the other hand, can have been governed by no venial
 motive whatever. The intentions of the first may be upright, as
 they may on the contrary be culpable. The views of the last cannot
 be upright, and must be culpable. But the truth is, that these
 papers are not addressed to persons falling under either of these
 characters. They solicit the attention of those only, who add to a
 sincere zeal for the happiness of their country, a temper favorable
 to a just estimate of the means of promoting it.
Persons of this character will proceed to an examination of the
 plan submitted by the convention, not only without a disposition to
 find or to magnify faults; but will see the propriety of
 reflecting, that a faultless plan was not to be expected. Nor will
 they barely make allowances for the errors which may be chargeable
 on the fallibility to which the convention, as a body of men, were
 liable; but will keep in mind, that they themselves also are but
 men, and ought not to assume an infallibility in rejudging the
 fallible opinions of others.
With equal readiness will it be perceived, that besides these
 inducements to candor, many allowances ought to be made for the
 difficulties inherent in the very nature of the undertaking referred
 to the convention.
The novelty of the undertaking immediately strikes us. It has
 been shown in the course of these papers, that the existing
 Confederation is founded on principles which are fallacious; that
 we must consequently change this first foundation, and with it the
 superstructure resting upon it. It has been shown, that the other
 confederacies which could be consulted as precedents have been
 vitiated by the same erroneous principles, and can therefore furnish
 no other light than that of beacons, which give warning of the
 course to be shunned, without pointing out that which ought to be
 pursued. The most that the convention could do in such a situation,
 was to avoid the errors suggested by the past experience of other
 countries, as well as of our own; and to provide a convenient mode
 of rectifying their own errors, as future experiences may unfold
 them.
Among the difficulties encountered by the convention, a very
 important one must have lain in combining the requisite stability
 and energy in government, with the inviolable attention due to
 liberty and to the republican form. Without substantially
 accomplishing this part of their undertaking, they would have very
 imperfectly fulfilled the object of their appointment, or the
 expectation of the public; yet that it could not be easily
 accomplished, will be denied by no one who is unwilling to betray
 his ignorance of the subject. Energy in government is essential to
 that security against external and internal danger, and to that
 prompt and salutary execution of the laws which enter into the very
 definition of good government. Stability in government is essential
 to national character and to the advantages annexed to it, as well
 as to that repose and confidence in the minds of the people, which
 are among the chief blessings of civil society. An irregular and
 mutable legislation is not more an evil in itself than it is odious
 to the people; and it may be pronounced with assurance that the
 people of this country, enlightened as they are with regard to the
 nature, and interested, as the great body of them are, in the
 effects of good government, will never be satisfied till some remedy
 be applied to the vicissitudes and uncertainties which characterize
 the State administrations. On comparing, however, these valuable
 ingredients with the vital principles of liberty, we must perceive
 at once the difficulty of mingling them together in their due
 proportions. The genius of republican liberty seems to demand on
 one side, not only that all power should be derived from the people,
 but that those intrusted with it should be kept in independence on
 the people, by a short duration of their appointments; and that
 even during this short period the trust should be placed not in a
 few, but a number of hands. Stability, on the contrary, requires
 that the hands in which power is lodged should continue for a length
 of time the same. A frequent change of men will result from a
 frequent return of elections; and a frequent change of measures
 from a frequent change of men: whilst energy in government requires
 not only a certain duration of power, but the execution of it by a
 single hand.
How far the convention may have succeeded in this part of their
 work, will better appear on a more accurate view of it. From the
 cursory view here taken, it must clearly appear to have been an
 arduous part.
Not less arduous must have been the task of marking the proper
 line of partition between the authority of the general and that of
 the State governments. Every man will be sensible of this
 difficulty, in proportion as he has been accustomed to contemplate
 and discriminate objects extensive and complicated in their nature.
 The faculties of the mind itself have never yet been distinguished
 and defined, with satisfactory precision, by all the efforts of the
 most acute and metaphysical philosophers. Sense, perception,
 judgment, desire, volition, memory, imagination, are found to be
 separated by such delicate shades and minute gradations that their
 boundaries have eluded the most subtle investigations, and remain a
 pregnant source of ingenious disquisition and controversy. The
 boundaries between the great kingdom of nature, and, still more,
 between the various provinces, and lesser portions, into which they
 are subdivided, afford another illustration of the same important
 truth. The most sagacious and laborious naturalists have never yet
 succeeded in tracing with certainty the line which separates the
 district of vegetable life from the neighboring region of
 unorganized matter, or which marks the ermination of the former and
 the commencement of the animal empire. A still greater obscurity
 lies in the distinctive characters by which the objects in each of
 these great departments of nature have been arranged and assorted.
When we pass from the works of nature, in which all the
 delineations are perfectly accurate, and appear to be otherwise only
 from the imperfection of the eye which surveys them, to the
 institutions of man, in which the obscurity arises as well from the
 object itself as from the organ by which it is contemplated, we must
 perceive the necessity of moderating still further our expectations
 and hopes from the efforts of human sagacity. Experience has
 instructed us that no skill in the science of government has yet
 been able to discriminate and define, with sufficient certainty, its
 three great provinces the legislative, executive, and judiciary; or
 even the privileges and powers of the different legislative branches.
 Questions daily occur in the course of practice, which prove the
 obscurity which reins in these subjects, and which puzzle the
 greatest adepts in political science.
The experience of ages, with the continued and combined labors
 of the most enlightened legislatures and jurists, has been equally
 unsuccessful in delineating the several objects and limits of
 different codes of laws and different tribunals of justice. The
 precise extent of the common law, and the statute law, the maritime
 law, the ecclesiastical law, the law of corporations, and other
 local laws and customs, remains still to be clearly and finally
 established in Great Britain, where accuracy in such subjects has
 been more industriously pursued than in any other part of the world.
 The jurisdiction of her several courts, general and local, of law,
 of equity, of admiralty, etc., is not less a source of frequent and
 intricate discussions, sufficiently denoting the indeterminate
 limits by which they are respectively circumscribed. All new laws,
 though penned with the greatest technical skill, and passed on the
 fullest and most mature deliberation, are considered as more or less
 obscure and equivocal, until their meaning be liquidated and
 ascertained by a series of particular discussions and adjudications.
 Besides the obscurity arising from the complexity of objects, and
 the imperfection of the human faculties, the medium through which
 the conceptions of men are conveyed to each other adds a fresh
 embarrassment. The use of words is to express ideas. Perspicuity,
 therefore, requires not only that the ideas should be distinctly
 formed, but that they should be expressed by words distinctly and
 exclusively appropriate to them. But no language is so copious as
 to supply words and phrases for every complex idea, or so correct as
 not to include many equivocally denoting different ideas. Hence it
 must happen that however accurately objects may be discriminated in
 themselves, and however accurately the discrimination may be
 considered, the definition of them may be rendered inaccurate by the
 inaccuracy of the terms in which it is delivered. And this
 unavoidable inaccuracy must be greater or less, according to the
 complexity and novelty of the objects defined. When the Almighty
 himself condescends to address mankind in their own language, his
 meaning, luminous as it must be, is rendered dim and doubtful by the
 cloudy medium through which it is communicated.
Here, then, are three sources of vague and incorrect
 definitions: indistinctness of the object, imperfection of the
 organ of conception, inadequateness of the vehicle of ideas. Any
 one of these must produce a certain degree of obscurity. The
 convention, in delineating the boundary between the federal and
 State jurisdictions, must have experienced the full effect of them
 all.
To the difficulties already mentioned may be added the
 interfering pretensions of the larger and smaller States. We cannot
 err in supposing that the former would contend for a participation
 in the government, fully proportioned to their superior wealth and
 importance; and that the latter would not be less tenacious of the
 equality at present enjoyed by them. We may well suppose that
 neither side would entirely yield to the other, and consequently
 that the struggle could be terminated only by compromise. It is
 extremely probable, also, that after the ratio of representation had
 been adjusted, this very compromise must have produced a fresh
 struggle between the same parties, to give such a turn to the
 organization of the government, and to the distribution of its
 powers, as would increase the importance of the branches, in forming
 which they had respectively obtained the greatest share of influence.
 There are features in the Constitution which warrant each of these
 suppositions; and as far as either of them is well founded, it
 shows that the convention must have been compelled to sacrifice
 theoretical propriety to the force of extraneous considerations.
Nor could it have been the large and small States only, which
 would marshal themselves in opposition to each other on various
 points. Other combinations, resulting from a difference of local
 position and policy, must have created additional difficulties. As
 every State may be divided into different districts, and its
 citizens into different classes, which give birth to contending
 interests and local jealousies, so the different parts of the United
 States are distinguished from each other by a variety of
 circumstances, which produce a like effect on a larger scale. And
 although this variety of interests, for reasons sufficiently
 explained in a former paper, may have a salutary influence on the
 administration of the government when formed, yet every one must be
 sensible of the contrary influence, which must have been experienced
 in the task of forming it.
Would it be wonderful if, under the pressure of all these
 difficulties, the convention should have been forced into some
 deviations from that artificial structure and regular symmetry which
 an abstract view of the subject might lead an ingenious theorist to
 bestow on a Constitution planned in his closet or in his
 imagination? The real wonder is that so many difficulties should
 have been surmounted, and surmounted with a unanimity almost as
 unprecedented as it must have been unexpected. It is impossible for
 any man of candor to reflect on this circumstance without partaking
 of the astonishment. It is impossible for the man of pious
 reflection not to perceive in it a finger of that Almighty hand
 which has been so frequently and signally extended to our relief in
 the critical stages of the revolution.
We had occasion, in a former paper, to take notice of the
 repeated trials which have been unsuccessfully made in the United
 Netherlands for reforming the baneful and notorious vices of their
 constitution. The history of almost all the great councils and
 consultations held among mankind for reconciling their discordant
 opinions, assuaging their mutual jealousies, and adjusting their
 respective interests, is a history of factions, contentions, and
 disappointments, and may be classed among the most dark and degraded
 pictures which display the infirmities and depravities of the human
 character. If, in a few scattered instances, a brighter aspect is
 presented, they serve only as exceptions to admonish us of the
 general truth; and by their lustre to darken the gloom of the
 adverse prospect to which they are contrasted. In revolving the
 causes from which these exceptions result, and applying them to the
 particular instances before us, we are necessarily led to two
 important conclusions. The first is, that the convention must have
 enjoyed, in a very singular degree, an exemption from the
 pestilential influence of party animosities the disease most
 incident to deliberative bodies, and most apt to contaminate their
 proceedings. The second conclusion is that all the deputations
 composing the convention were satisfactorily accommodated by the
 final act, or were induced to accede to it by a deep conviction of
 the necessity of sacrificing private opinions and partial interests
 to the public good, and by a despair of seeing this necessity
 diminished by delays or by new experiments.


FEDERALIST No. 38

The Same Subject Continued, and the Incoherence of the Objections
 to the New Plan Exposed
From the New York Packet.
Tuesday, January 15, 1788.

MADISON

To the People of the State of New York:
IT IS not a little remarkable that in every case reported by
 ancient history, in which government has been established with
 deliberation and consent, the task of framing it has not been
 committed to an assembly of men, but has been performed by some
 individual citizen of preeminent wisdom and approved integrity.
Minos, we learn, was the primitive founder of the government of
 Crete, as Zaleucus was of that of the Locrians. Theseus first, and
 after him Draco and Solon, instituted the government of Athens.
 Lycurgus was the lawgiver of Sparta. The foundation of the
 original government of Rome was laid by Romulus, and the work
 completed by two of his elective successors, Numa and Tullius
 Hostilius. On the abolition of royalty the consular administration
 was substituted by Brutus, who stepped forward with a project for
 such a reform, which, he alleged, had been prepared by Tullius
 Hostilius, and to which his address obtained the assent and
 ratification of the senate and people. This remark is applicable to
 confederate governments also. Amphictyon, we are told, was the
 author of that which bore his name. The Achaean league received its
 first birth from Achaeus, and its second from Aratus.
What degree of agency these reputed lawgivers might have in
 their respective establishments, or how far they might be clothed
 with the legitimate authority of the people, cannot in every
 instance be ascertained. In some, however, the proceeding was
 strictly regular. Draco appears to have been intrusted by the
 people of Athens with indefinite powers to reform its government and
 laws. And Solon, according to Plutarch, was in a manner compelled,
 by the universal suffrage of his fellow-citizens, to take upon him
 the sole and absolute power of new-modeling the constitution. The
 proceedings under Lycurgus were less regular; but as far as the
 advocates for a regular reform could prevail, they all turned their
 eyes towards the single efforts of that celebrated patriot and sage,
 instead of seeking to bring about a revolution by the intervention
 of a deliberative body of citizens.
Whence could it have proceeded, that a people, jealous as the
 Greeks were of their liberty, should so far abandon the rules of
 caution as to place their destiny in the hands of a single citizen?
 Whence could it have proceeded, that the Athenians, a people who
 would not suffer an army to be commanded by fewer than ten generals,
 and who required no other proof of danger to their liberties than
 the illustrious merit of a fellow-citizen, should consider one
 illustrious citizen as a more eligible depositary of the fortunes of
 themselves and their posterity, than a select body of citizens, from
 whose common deliberations more wisdom, as well as more safety,
 might have been expected? These questions cannot be fully answered,
 without supposing that the fears of discord and disunion among a
 number of counsellors exceeded the apprehension of treachery or
 incapacity in a single individual. History informs us, likewise, of
 the difficulties with which these celebrated reformers had to
 contend, as well as the expedients which they were obliged to employ
 in order to carry their reforms into effect. Solon, who seems to
 have indulged a more temporizing policy, confessed that he had not
 given to his countrymen the government best suited to their
 happiness, but most tolerable to their prejudices. And Lycurgus,
 more true to his object, was under the necessity of mixing a portion
 of violence with the authority of superstition, and of securing his
 final success by a voluntary renunciation, first of his country, and
 then of his life. If these lessons teach us, on one hand, to admire
 the improvement made by America on the ancient mode of preparing and
 establishing regular plans of government, they serve not less, on
 the other, to admonish us of the hazards and difficulties incident
 to such experiments, and of the great imprudence of unnecessarily
 multiplying them.
Is it an unreasonable conjecture, that the errors which may be
 contained in the plan of the convention are such as have resulted
 rather from the defect of antecedent experience on this complicated
 and difficult subject, than from a want of accuracy or care in the
 investigation of it; and, consequently such as will not be
 ascertained until an actual trial shall have pointed them out? This
 conjecture is rendered probable, not only by many considerations of
 a general nature, but by the particular case of the Articles of
 Confederation. It is observable that among the numerous objections
 and amendments suggested by the several States, when these articles
 were submitted for their ratification, not one is found which
 alludes to the great and radical error which on actual trial has
 discovered itself. And if we except the observations which New
 Jersey was led to make, rather by her local situation, than by her
 peculiar foresight, it may be questioned whether a single suggestion
 was of sufficient moment to justify a revision of the system. There
 is abundant reason, nevertheless, to suppose that immaterial as
 these objections were, they would have been adhered to with a very
 dangerous inflexibility, in some States, had not a zeal for their
 opinions and supposed interests been stifled by the more powerful
 sentiment of selfpreservation. One State, we may remember,
 persisted for several years in refusing her concurrence, although
 the enemy remained the whole period at our gates, or rather in the
 very bowels of our country. Nor was her pliancy in the end effected
 by a less motive, than the fear of being chargeable with protracting
 the public calamities, and endangering the event of the contest.
 Every candid reader will make the proper reflections on these
 important facts.
A patient who finds his disorder daily growing worse, and that
 an efficacious remedy can no longer be delayed without extreme
 danger, after coolly revolving his situation, and the characters of
 different physicians, selects and calls in such of them as he judges
 most capable of administering relief, and best entitled to his
 confidence. The physicians attend; the case of the patient is
 carefully examined; a consultation is held; they are unanimously
 agreed that the symptoms are critical, but that the case, with
 proper and timely relief, is so far from being desperate, that it
 may be made to issue in an improvement of his constitution. They
 are equally unanimous in prescribing the remedy, by which this happy
 effect is to be produced. The prescription is no sooner made known,
 however, than a number of persons interpose, and, without denying
 the reality or danger of the disorder, assure the patient that the
 prescription will be poison to his constitution, and forbid him,
 under pain of certain death, to make use of it. Might not the
 patient reasonably demand, before he ventured to follow this advice,
 that the authors of it should at least agree among themselves on
 some other remedy to be substituted? And if he found them differing
 as much from one another as from his first counsellors, would he not
 act prudently in trying the experiment unanimously recommended by
 the latter, rather than be hearkening to those who could neither
 deny the necessity of a speedy remedy, nor agree in proposing one?
Such a patient and in such a situation is America at this moment.
 She has been sensible of her malady. She has obtained a regular
 and unanimous advice from men of her own deliberate choice. And she
 is warned by others against following this advice under pain of the
 most fatal consequences. Do the monitors deny the reality of her
 danger? No. Do they deny the necessity of some speedy and powerful
 remedy? No. Are they agreed, are any two of them agreed, in their
 objections to the remedy proposed, or in the proper one to be
 substituted? Let them speak for themselves. This one tells us that
 the proposed Constitution ought to be rejected, because it is not a
 confederation of the States, but a government over individuals.
 Another admits that it ought to be a government over individuals to
 a certain extent, but by no means to the extent proposed. A third
 does not object to the government over individuals, or to the extent
 proposed, but to the want of a bill of rights. A fourth concurs in
 the absolute necessity of a bill of rights, but contends that it
 ought to be declaratory, not of the personal rights of individuals,
 but of the rights reserved to the States in their political capacity.
 A fifth is of opinion that a bill of rights of any sort would be
 superfluous and misplaced, and that the plan would be
 unexceptionable but for the fatal power of regulating the times and
 places of election. An objector in a large State exclaims loudly
 against the unreasonable equality of representation in the Senate.
 An objector in a small State is equally loud against the dangerous
 inequality in the House of Representatives. From this quarter, we
 are alarmed with the amazing expense, from the number of persons who
 are to administer the new government. From another quarter, and
 sometimes from the same quarter, on another occasion, the cry is
 that the Congress will be but a shadow of a representation, and that
 the government would be far less objectionable if the number and the
 expense were doubled. A patriot in a State that does not import or
 export, discerns insuperable objections against the power of direct
 taxation. The patriotic adversary in a State of great exports and
 imports, is not less dissatisfied that the whole burden of taxes may
 be thrown on consumption. This politician discovers in the
 Constitution a direct and irresistible tendency to monarchy; that
 is equally sure it will end in aristocracy. Another is puzzled to
 say which of these shapes it will ultimately assume, but sees
 clearly it must be one or other of them; whilst a fourth is not
 wanting, who with no less confidence affirms that the Constitution
 is so far from having a bias towards either of these dangers, that
 the weight on that side will not be sufficient to keep it upright
 and firm against its opposite propensities. With another class of
 adversaries to the Constitution the language is that the
 legislative, executive, and judiciary departments are intermixed in
 such a manner as to contradict all the ideas of regular government
 and all the requisite precautions in favor of liberty. Whilst this
 objection circulates in vague and general expressions, there are but
 a few who lend their sanction to it. Let each one come forward with
 his particular explanation, and scarce any two are exactly agreed
 upon the subject. In the eyes of one the junction of the Senate
 with the President in the responsible function of appointing to
 offices, instead of vesting this executive power in the Executive
 alone, is the vicious part of the organization. To another, the
 exclusion of the House of Representatives, whose numbers alone could
 be a due security against corruption and partiality in the exercise
 of such a power, is equally obnoxious. With another, the admission
 of the President into any share of a power which ever must be a
 dangerous engine in the hands of the executive magistrate, is an
 unpardonable violation of the maxims of republican jealousy. No
 part of the arrangement, according to some, is more inadmissible
 than the trial of impeachments by the Senate, which is alternately a
 member both of the legislative and executive departments, when this
 power so evidently belonged to the judiciary department. ``We
 concur fully,'' reply others, ``in the objection to this part of the
 plan, but we can never agree that a reference of impeachments to the
 judiciary authority would be an amendment of the error. Our
 principal dislike to the organization arises from the extensive
 powers already lodged in that department.'' Even among the zealous
 patrons of a council of state the most irreconcilable variance is
 discovered concerning the mode in which it ought to be constituted.
 The demand of one gentleman is, that the council should consist of
 a small number to be appointed by the most numerous branch of the
 legislature. Another would prefer a larger number, and considers it
 as a fundamental condition that the appointment should be made by
 the President himself.
As it can give no umbrage to the writers against the plan of the
 federal Constitution, let us suppose, that as they are the most
 zealous, so they are also the most sagacious, of those who think the
 late convention were unequal to the task assigned them, and that a
 wiser and better plan might and ought to be substituted. Let us
 further suppose that their country should concur, both in this
 favorable opinion of their merits, and in their unfavorable opinion
 of the convention; and should accordingly proceed to form them into
 a second convention, with full powers, and for the express purpose
 of revising and remoulding the work of the first. Were the
 experiment to be seriously made, though it required some effort to
 view it seriously even in fiction, I leave it to be decided by the
 sample of opinions just exhibited, whether, with all their enmity to
 their predecessors, they would, in any one point, depart so widely
 from their example, as in the discord and ferment that would mark
 their own deliberations; and whether the Constitution, now before
 the public, would not stand as fair a chance for immortality, as
 Lycurgus gave to that of Sparta, by making its change to depend on
 his own return from exile and death, if it were to be immediately
 adopted, and were to continue in force, not until a BETTER, but
 until ANOTHER should be agreed upon by this new assembly of
 lawgivers.
It is a matter both of wonder and regret, that those who raise
 so many objections against the new Constitution should never call to
 mind the defects of that which is to be exchanged for it. It is not
 necessary that the former should be perfect; it is sufficient that
 the latter is more imperfect. No man would refuse to give brass for
 silver or gold, because the latter had some alloy in it. No man
 would refuse to quit a shattered and tottering habitation for a firm
 and commodious building, because the latter had not a porch to it,
 or because some of the rooms might be a little larger or smaller, or
 the ceilings a little higher or lower than his fancy would have
 planned them. But waiving illustrations of this sort, is it not
 manifest that most of the capital objections urged against the new
 system lie with tenfold weight against the existing Confederation?
 Is an indefinite power to raise money dangerous in the hands of the
 federal government? The present Congress can make requisitions to
 any amount they please, and the States are constitutionally bound to
 furnish them; they can emit bills of credit as long as they will
 pay for the paper; they can borrow, both abroad and at home, as
 long as a shilling will be lent. Is an indefinite power to raise
 troops dangerous? The Confederation gives to Congress that power
 also; and they have already begun to make use of it. Is it
 improper and unsafe to intermix the different powers of government
 in the same body of men? Congress, a single body of men, are the
 sole depositary of all the federal powers. Is it particularly
 dangerous to give the keys of the treasury, and the command of the
 army, into the same hands? The Confederation places them both in
 the hands of Congress. Is a bill of rights essential to liberty?
 The Confederation has no bill of rights. Is it an objection
 against the new Constitution, that it empowers the Senate, with the
 concurrence of the Executive, to make treaties which are to be the
 laws of the land? The existing Congress, without any such control,
 can make treaties which they themselves have declared, and most of
 the States have recognized, to be the supreme law of the land. Is
 the importation of slaves permitted by the new Constitution for
 twenty years? By the old it is permitted forever.
I shall be told, that however dangerous this mixture of powers
 may be in theory, it is rendered harmless by the dependence of
 Congress on the State for the means of carrying them into practice;
 that however large the mass of powers may be, it is in fact a
 lifeless mass. Then, say I, in the first place, that the
 Confederation is chargeable with the still greater folly of
 declaring certain powers in the federal government to be absolutely
 necessary, and at the same time rendering them absolutely nugatory;
 and, in the next place, that if the Union is to continue, and no
 better government be substituted, effective powers must either be
 granted to, or assumed by, the existing Congress; in either of
 which events, the contrast just stated will hold good. But this is
 not all. Out of this lifeless mass has already grown an excrescent
 power, which tends to realize all the dangers that can be
 apprehended from a defective construction of the supreme government
 of the Union. It is now no longer a point of speculation and hope,
 that the Western territory is a mine of vast wealth to the United
 States; and although it is not of such a nature as to extricate
 them from their present distresses, or for some time to come, to
 yield any regular supplies for the public expenses, yet must it
 hereafter be able, under proper management, both to effect a gradual
 discharge of the domestic debt, and to furnish, for a certain
 period, liberal tributes to the federal treasury. A very large
 proportion of this fund has been already surrendered by individual
 States; and it may with reason be expected that the remaining
 States will not persist in withholding similar proofs of their
 equity and generosity. We may calculate, therefore, that a rich and
 fertile country, of an area equal to the inhabited extent of the
 United States, will soon become a national stock. Congress have
 assumed the administration of this stock. They have begun to render
 it productive. Congress have undertaken to do more: they have
 proceeded to form new States, to erect temporary governments, to
 appoint officers for them, and to prescribe the conditions on which
 such States shall be admitted into the Confederacy. All this has
 been done; and done without the least color of constitutional
 authority. Yet no blame has been whispered; no alarm has been
 sounded. A GREAT and INDEPENDENT fund of revenue is passing into
 the hands of a SINGLE BODY of men, who can RAISE TROOPS to an
 INDEFINITE NUMBER, and appropriate money to their support for an
 INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME. And yet there are men, who have not only
 been silent spectators of this prospect, but who are advocates for
 the system which exhibits it; and, at the same time, urge against
 the new system the objections which we have heard. Would they not
 act with more consistency, in urging the establishment of the
 latter, as no less necessary to guard the Union against the future
 powers and resources of a body constructed like the existing
 Congress, than to save it from the dangers threatened by the present
 impotency of that Assembly?
I mean not, by any thing here said, to throw censure on the
 measures which have been pursued by Congress. I am sensible they
 could not have done otherwise. The public interest, the necessity
 of the case, imposed upon them the task of overleaping their
 constitutional limits. But is not the fact an alarming proof of the
 danger resulting from a government which does not possess regular
 powers commensurate to its objects? A dissolution or usurpation is
 the dreadful dilemma to which it is continually exposed.

FEDERALIST No. 39

The Conformity of the Plan to Republican Principles
For the Independent Journal.

MADISON

To the People of the State of New York:
THE last paper having concluded the observations which were
 meant to introduce a candid survey of the plan of government
 reported by the convention, we now proceed to the execution of that
 part of our undertaking.
The first question that offers itself is, whether the general
 form and aspect of the government be strictly republican. It is
 evident that no other form would be reconcilable with the genius of
 the people of America; with the fundamental principles of the
 Revolution; or with that honorable determination which animates
 every votary of freedom, to rest all our political experiments on
 the capacity of mankind for self-government. If the plan of the
 convention, therefore, be found to depart from the republican
 character, its advocates must abandon it as no longer defensible.
What, then, are the distinctive characters of the republican
 form? Were an answer to this question to be sought, not by
 recurring to principles, but in the application of the term by
 political writers, to the constitution of different States, no
 satisfactory one would ever be found. Holland, in which no particle
 of the supreme authority is derived from the people, has passed
 almost universally under the denomination of a republic. The same
 title has been bestowed on Venice, where absolute power over the
 great body of the people is exercised, in the most absolute manner,
 by a small body of hereditary nobles. Poland, which is a mixture of
 aristocracy and of monarchy in their worst forms, has been dignified
 with the same appellation. The government of England, which has one
 republican branch only, combined with an hereditary aristocracy and
 monarchy, has, with equal impropriety, been frequently placed on the
 list of republics. These examples, which are nearly as dissimilar
 to each other as to a genuine republic, show the extreme inaccuracy
 with which the term has been used in political disquisitions.
If we resort for a criterion to the different principles on
 which different forms of government are established, we may define a
 republic to be, or at least may bestow that name on, a government
 which derives all its powers directly or indirectly from the great
 body of the people, and is administered by persons holding their
 offices during pleasure, for a limited period, or during good
 behavior. It is ESSENTIAL to such a government that it be derived
 from the great body of the society, not from an inconsiderable
 proportion, or a favored class of it; otherwise a handful of
 tyrannical nobles, exercising their oppressions by a delegation of
 their powers, might aspire to the rank of republicans, and claim for
 their government the honorable title of republic. It is SUFFICIENT
 for such a government that the persons administering it be
 appointed, either directly or indirectly, by the people; and that
 they hold their appointments by either of the tenures just
 specified; otherwise every government in the United States, as well
 as every other popular government that has been or can be well
 organized or well executed, would be degraded from the republican
 character. According to the constitution of every State in the
 Union, some or other of the officers of government are appointed
 indirectly only by the people. According to most of them, the chief
 magistrate himself is so appointed. And according to one, this mode
 of appointment is extended to one of the co-ordinate branches of the
 legislature. According to all the constitutions, also, the tenure
 of the highest offices is extended to a definite period, and in many
 instances, both within the legislative and executive departments, to
 a period of years. According to the provisions of most of the
 constitutions, again, as well as according to the most respectable
 and received opinions on the subject, the members of the judiciary
 department are to retain their offices by the firm tenure of good
 behavior.
On comparing the Constitution planned by the convention with the
 standard here fixed, we perceive at once that it is, in the most
 rigid sense, conformable to it. The House of Representatives, like
 that of one branch at least of all the State legislatures, is
 elected immediately by the great body of the people. The Senate,
 like the present Congress, and the Senate of Maryland, derives its
 appointment indirectly from the people. The President is indirectly
 derived from the choice of the people, according to the example in
 most of the States. Even the judges, with all other officers of the
 Union, will, as in the several States, be the choice, though a
 remote choice, of the people themselves, the duration of the
 appointments is equally conformable to the republican standard, and
 to the model of State constitutions The House of Representatives is
 periodically elective, as in all the States; and for the period of
 two years, as in the State of South Carolina. The Senate is
 elective, for the period of six years; which is but one year more
 than the period of the Senate of Maryland, and but two more than
 that of the Senates of New York and Virginia. The President is to
 continue in office for the period of four years; as in New York and
 Delaware, the chief magistrate is elected for three years, and in
 South Carolina for two years. In the other States the election is
 annual. In several of the States, however, no constitutional
 provision is made for the impeachment of the chief magistrate. And
 in Delaware and Virginia he is not impeachable till out of office.
 The President of the United States is impeachable at any time
 during his continuance in office. The tenure by which the judges
 are to hold their places, is, as it unquestionably ought to be, that
 of good behavior. The tenure of the ministerial offices generally,
 will be a subject of legal regulation, conformably to the reason of
 the case and the example of the State constitutions.
Could any further proof be required of the republican complexion
 of this system, the most decisive one might be found in its absolute
 prohibition of titles of nobility, both under the federal and the
 State governments; and in its express guaranty of the republican
 form to each of the latter.
``But it was not sufficient,'' say the adversaries of the
 proposed Constitution, ``for the convention to adhere to the
 republican form. They ought, with equal care, to have preserved the
 FEDERAL form, which regards the Union as a CONFEDERACY of sovereign
 states; instead of which, they have framed a NATIONAL government,
 which regards the Union as a CONSOLIDATION of the States.'' And it
 is asked by what authority this bold and radical innovation was
 undertaken? The handle which has been made of this objection
 requires that it should be examined with some precision.
Without inquiring into the accuracy of the distinction on which
 the objection is founded, it will be necessary to a just estimate of
 its force, first, to ascertain the real character of the government
 in question; secondly, to inquire how far the convention were
 authorized to propose such a government; and thirdly, how far the
 duty they owed to their country could supply any defect of regular
 authority.
First. In order to ascertain the real character of the
 government, it may be considered in relation to the foundation on
 which it is to be established; to the sources from which its
 ordinary powers are to be drawn; to the operation of those powers;
 to the extent of them; and to the authority by which future
 changes in the government are to be introduced.
On examining the first relation, it appears, on one hand, that
 the Constitution is to be founded on the assent and ratification of
 the people of America, given by deputies elected for the special
 purpose; but, on the other, that this assent and ratification is to
 be given by the people, not as individuals composing one entire
 nation, but as composing the distinct and independent States to
 which they respectively belong. It is to be the assent and
 ratification of the several States, derived from the supreme
 authority in each State, the authority of the people themselves.
 The act, therefore, establishing the Constitution, will not be a
 NATIONAL, but a FEDERAL act.
That it will be a federal and not a national act, as these terms
 are understood by the objectors; the act of the people, as forming
 so many independent States, not as forming one aggregate nation, is
 obvious from this single consideration, that it is to result neither
 from the decision of a MAJORITY of the people of the Union, nor from
 that of a MAJORITY of the States. It must result from the UNANIMOUS
 assent of the several States that are parties to it, differing no
 otherwise from their ordinary assent than in its being expressed,
 not by the legislative authority, but by that of the people
 themselves. Were the people regarded in this transaction as forming
 one nation, the will of the majority of the whole people of the
 United States would bind the minority, in the same manner as the
 majority in each State must bind the minority; and the will of the
 majority must be determined either by a comparison of the individual
 votes, or by considering the will of the majority of the States as
 evidence of the will of a majority of the people of the United
 States. Neither of these rules have been adopted. Each State, in
 ratifying the Constitution, is considered as a sovereign body,
 independent of all others, and only to be bound by its own voluntary
 act. In this relation, then, the new Constitution will, if
 established, be a FEDERAL, and not a NATIONAL constitution.
The next relation is, to the sources from which the ordinary
 powers of government are to be derived. The House of
 Representatives will derive its powers from the people of America;
 and the people will be represented in the same proportion, and on
 the same principle, as they are in the legislature of a particular
 State. So far the government is NATIONAL, not FEDERAL. The Senate,
 on the other hand, will derive its powers from the States, as
 political and coequal societies; and these will be represented on
 the principle of equality in the Senate, as they now are in the
 existing Congress. So far the government is FEDERAL, not NATIONAL.
 The executive power will be derived from a very compound source.
 The immediate election of the President is to be made by the States
 in their political characters. The votes allotted to them are in a
 compound ratio, which considers them partly as distinct and coequal
 societies, partly as unequal members of the same society. The
 eventual election, again, is to be made by that branch of the
 legislature which consists of the national representatives; but in
 this particular act they are to be thrown into the form of
 individual delegations, from so many distinct and coequal bodies
 politic. From this aspect of the government it appears to be of a
 mixed character, presenting at least as many FEDERAL as NATIONAL
 features.
The difference between a federal and national government, as it
 relates to the OPERATION OF THE GOVERNMENT, is supposed to consist
 in this, that in the former the powers operate on the political
 bodies composing the Confederacy, in their political capacities; in
 the latter, on the individual citizens composing the nation, in
 their individual capacities. On trying the Constitution by this
 criterion, it falls under the NATIONAL, not the FEDERAL character;
 though perhaps not so completely as has been understood. In
 several cases, and particularly in the trial of controversies to
 which States may be parties, they must be viewed and proceeded
 against in their collective and political capacities only. So far
 the national countenance of the government on this side seems to be
 disfigured by a few federal features. But this blemish is perhaps
 unavoidable in any plan; and the operation of the government on the
 people, in their individual capacities, in its ordinary and most
 essential proceedings, may, on the whole, designate it, in this
 relation, a NATIONAL government.
But if the government be national with regard to the OPERATION
 of its powers, it changes its aspect again when we contemplate it in
 relation to the EXTENT of its powers. The idea of a national
 government involves in it, not only an authority over the individual
 citizens, but an indefinite supremacy over all persons and things,
 so far as they are objects of lawful government. Among a people
 consolidated into one nation, this supremacy is completely vested in
 the national legislature. Among communities united for particular
 purposes, it is vested partly in the general and partly in the
 municipal legislatures. In the former case, all local authorities
 are subordinate to the supreme; and may be controlled, directed, or
 abolished by it at pleasure. In the latter, the local or municipal
 authorities form distinct and independent portions of the supremacy,
 no more subject, within their respective spheres, to the general
 authority, than the general authority is subject to them, within its
 own sphere. In this relation, then, the proposed government cannot
 be deemed a NATIONAL one; since its jurisdiction extends to certain
 enumerated objects only, and leaves to the several States a
 residuary and inviolable sovereignty over all other objects. It is
 true that in controversies relating to the boundary between the two
 jurisdictions, the tribunal which is ultimately to decide, is to be
 established under the general government. But this does not change
 the principle of the case. The decision is to be impartially made,
 according to the rules of the Constitution; and all the usual and
 most effectual precautions are taken to secure this impartiality.
 Some such tribunal is clearly essential to prevent an appeal to the
 sword and a dissolution of the compact; and that it ought to be
 established under the general rather than under the local
 governments, or, to speak more properly, that it could be safely
 established under the first alone, is a position not likely to be
 combated.
If we try the Constitution by its last relation to the authority
 by which amendments are to be made, we find it neither wholly
 NATIONAL nor wholly FEDERAL. Were it wholly national, the supreme
 and ultimate authority would reside in the MAJORITY of the people of
 the Union; and this authority would be competent at all times, like
 that of a majority of every national society, to alter or abolish
 its established government. Were it wholly federal, on the other
 hand, the concurrence of each State in the Union would be essential
 to every alteration that would be binding on all. The mode provided
 by the plan of the convention is not founded on either of these
 principles. In requiring more than a majority, and principles. In
 requiring more than a majority, and particularly in computing the
 proportion by STATES, not by CITIZENS, it departs from the NATIONAL
 and advances towards the FEDERAL character; in rendering the
 concurrence of less than the whole number of States sufficient, it
 loses again the FEDERAL and partakes of the NATIONAL character.
The proposed Constitution, therefore, is, in strictness, neither
 a national nor a federal Constitution, but a composition of both.
 In its foundation it is federal, not national; in the sources from
 which the ordinary powers of the government are drawn, it is partly
 federal and partly national; in the operation of these powers, it
 is national, not federal; in the extent of them, again, it is
 federal, not national; and, finally, in the authoritative mode of
 introducing amendments, it is neither wholly federal nor wholly
 national.

FEDERALIST No. 40
The Powers of the Convention to Form a Mixed Government Examined
and Sustained
From the New York Packet. 
Friday, January 18, 1788. 

MADISON

To the People of the State of New York:
THE SECOND point to be examined is, whether the convention were
authorized to frame and propose this mixed Constitution. The
powers of the convention ought, in strictness, to be determined
by an inspection of the commissions given to the members by their
respective constituents. As all of these, however, had reference,
either to the recommendation from the meeting at Annapolis, in
September, 1786, or to that from Congress, in February, 1787, it
will be sufficient to recur to these particular acts. The act
from Annapolis recommends the ``appointment of commissioners to
take into consideration the situation of the United States; to
devise SUCH FURTHER PROVISIONS as shall appear to them necessary
to render the Constitution of the federal government ADEQUATE TO
THE EXIGENCIES OF THE UNION; and to report such an act for that
purpose, to the United States in Congress assembled, as when
agreed to by them, and afterwards confirmed by the legislature of
every State, will effectually provide for the same. ''The
recommendatory act of Congress is in the words
following:``WHEREAS, There is provision in the articles of
Confederation and perpetual Union, for making alterations
therein, by the assent of a Congress of the United States, and of
the legislatures of the several States; and whereas experience
hath evinced, that there are defects in the present
Confederation; as a mean to remedy which, several of the States,
and PARTICULARLY THE STATE OF NEW YORK, by express instructions
to their delegates in Congress, have suggested a convention for
the purposes expressed in the following resolution; and such
convention appearing to be the most probable mean of establishing
in these States A FIRM NATIONAL GOVERNMENT:``Resolved, That in
the opinion of Congress it is expedient, that on the second
Monday of May next a convention of delegates, who shall have been
appointed by the several States, be held at Philadelphia, for the
sole and express purpose OF REVISING THE ARTICLES OF
CONFEDERATION, and reporting to Congress and the several
legislatures such ALTERATIONS AND PROVISIONS THEREIN, as shall,
when agreed to in Congress, and confirmed by the States, render
the federal Constitution ADEQUATE TO THE EXIGENCIES OF GOVERNMENT
AND THE PRESERVATION OF THE UNION. ''From these two acts, it
appears, 1st, that the object of the convention was to establish,
in these States, A FIRM NATIONAL GOVERNMENT; 2d, that this
government was to be such as would be ADEQUATE TO THE EXIGENCIES
OF GOVERNMENT and THE PRESERVATION OF THE UNION; 3d, that these
purposes were to be effected by ALTERATIONS AND PROVISIONS IN THE
ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION, as it is expressed in the act of
Congress, or by SUCH FURTHER PROVISIONS AS SHOULD APPEAR
NECESSARY, as it stands in the recommendatory act from Annapolis;
4th, that the alterations and provisions were to be reported to
Congress, and to the States, in order to be agreed to by the
former and confirmed by the latter. From a comparison and fair
construction of these several modes of expression, is to be
deduced the authority under which the convention acted. They were
to frame a NATIONAL GOVERNMENT, adequate to the EXIGENCIES OF
GOVERNMENT, and OF THE UNION; and to reduce the articles of
Confederation into such form as to accomplish these purposes.
There are two rules of construction, dictated by plain reason, as
well as founded on legal axioms. The one is, that every part of
the expression ought, if possible, to be allowed some meaning,
and be made to conspire to some common end. The other is, that
where the several parts cannot be made to coincide, the less
important should give way to the more important part; the means
should be sacrificed to the end, rather than the end to the
means. Suppose, then, that the expressions defining the
authority of the convention were irreconcilably at variance with
each other; that a NATIONAL and ADEQUATE GOVERNMENT could not
possibly, in the judgment of the convention, be affected by
ALTERATIONS and PROVISIONS in the ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION;
which part of the definition ought to have been embraced, and
which rejected? Which was the more important, which the less
important part? Which the end; which the means? Let the most
scrupulous expositors of delegated powers; let the most
inveterate objectors against those exercised by the convention,
answer these questions. Let them declare, whether it was of most
importance to the happiness of the people of America, that the
articles of Confederation should be disregarded, and an adequate
government be provided, and the Union preserved; or that an
adequate government should be omitted, and the articles of
Confederation preserved. Let them declare, whether the
preservation of these articles was the end, for securing which a
reform of the government was to be introduced as the means; or
whether the establishment of a government, adequate to the
national happiness, was the end at which these articles
themselves originally aimed, and to which they ought, as
insufficient means, to have been sacrificed. But is it necessary
to suppose that these expressions are absolutely irreconcilable
to each other; that no ALTERATIONS or PROVISIONS in THE ARTICLES
OF THE CONFEDERATION could possibly mould them into a national
and adequate government; into such a government as has been
proposed by the convention? No stress, it is presumed, will, in
this case, be laid on the TITLE; a change of that could never be
deemed an exercise of ungranted power. ALTERATIONS in the body of
the instrument are expressly authorized. NEW PROVISIONS therein
are also expressly authorized. Here then is a power to change the
title; to insert new articles; to alter old ones. Must it of
necessity be admitted that this power is infringed, so long as a
part of the old articles remain? Those who maintain the
affirmative ought at least to mark the boundary between
authorized and usurped innovations; between that degree of change
which lies within the compass of ALTERATIONS AND FURTHER
PROVISIONS, and that which amounts to a TRANSMUTATION of the
government. Will it be said that the alterations ought not to
have touched the substance of the Confederation? The States
would never have appointed a convention with so much solemnity,
nor described its objects with so much latitude, if some
SUBSTANTIAL reform had not been in contemplation. Will it be said
that the FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES of the Confederation were not
within the purview of the convention, and ought not to have been
varied? I ask, What are these principles? Do they require that,
in the establishment of the Constitution, the States should be
regarded as distinct and independent sovereigns? They are so
regarded by the Constitution proposed. Do they require that the
members of the government should derive their appointment from
the legislatures, not from the people of the States? One branch
of the new government is to be appointed by these legislatures;
and under the Confederation, the delegates to Congress MAY ALL
be appointed immediately by the people, and in two States1 are
actually so appointed. Do they require that the powers of the
government should act on the States, and not immediately on
individuals? In some instances, as has been shown, the powers of
the new government will act on the States in their collective
characters. In some instances, also, those of the existing
government act immediately on individuals. In cases of capture;
of piracy; of the post office; of coins, weights, and measures;
of trade with the Indians; of claims under grants of land by
different States; and, above all, in the case of trials by
courts-marshal in the army and navy, by which death may be
inflicted without the intervention of a jury, or even of a civil
magistrate; in all these cases the powers of the Confederation
operate immediately on the persons and interests of individual
citizens. Do these fundamental principles require, particularly,
that no tax should be levied without the intermediate agency of
the States? The Confederation itself authorizes a direct tax, to
a certain extent, on the post office. The power of coinage has
been so construed by Congress as to levy a tribute immediately
from that source also. But pretermitting these instances, was it
not an acknowledged object of the convention and the universal
expectation of the people, that the regulation of trade should be
submitted to the general government in such a form as would
render it an immediate source of general revenue? Had not
Congress repeatedly recommended this measure as not inconsistent
with the fundamental principles of the Confederation? Had not
every State but one; had not New York herself, so far complied
with the plan of Congress as to recognize the PRINCIPLE of the
innovation? Do these principles, in fine, require that the
powers of the general government should be limited, and that,
beyond this limit, the States should be left in possession of
their sovereignty and independence? We have seen that in the new
government, as in the old, the general powers are limited; and
that the States, in all unenumerated cases, are left in the
enjoyment of their sovereign and independent jurisdiction. The
truth is, that the great principles of the Constitution proposed
by the convention may be considered less as absolutely new, than
as the expansion of principles which are found in the articles of
Confederation. The misfortune under the latter system has been,
that these principles are so feeble and confined as to justify
all the charges of inefficiency which have been urged against it,
and to require a degree of enlargement which gives to the new
system the aspect of an entire transformation of the old. In one
particular it is admitted that the convention have departed from
the tenor of their commission. Instead of reporting a plan
requiring the confirmation OF THE LEGISLATURES OF ALL THE STATES,
they have reported a plan which is to be confirmed by the PEOPLE,
and may be carried into effect by NINE STATES ONLY. It is worthy
of remark that this objection, though the most plausible, has
been the least urged in the publications which have swarmed
against the convention. The forbearance can only have proceeded
from an irresistible conviction of the absurdity of subjecting
the fate of twelve States to the perverseness or corruption of a
thirteenth; from the example of inflexible opposition given by a
MAJORITY of one sixtieth of the people of America to a measure
approved and called for by the voice of twelve States, comprising
fifty-nine sixtieths of the people an example still fresh in the
memory and indignation of every citizen who has felt for the
wounded honor and prosperity of his country. As this objection,
therefore, has been in a manner waived by those who have
criticised the powers of the convention, I dismiss it without
further observation. The THIRD point to be inquired into is, how
far considerations of duty arising out of the case itself could
have supplied any defect of regular authority. In the preceding
inquiries the powers of the convention have been analyzed and
tried with the same rigor, and by the same rules, as if they had
been real and final powers for the establishment of a
Constitution for the United States. We have seen in what manner
they have borne the trial even on that supposition. It is time
now to recollect that the powers were merely advisory and
recommendatory; that they were so meant by the States, and so
understood by the convention; and that the latter have
accordingly planned and proposed a Constitution which is to be of
no more consequence than the paper on which it is written, unless
it be stamped with the approbation of those to whom it is
addressed. This reflection places the subject in a point of view
altogether different, and will enable us to judge with propriety
of the course taken by the convention. Let us view the ground on
which the convention stood. It may be collected from their
proceedings, that they were deeply and unanimously impressed with
the crisis, which had led their country almost with one voice to
make so singular and solemn an experiment for correcting the
errors of a system by which this crisis had been produced; that
they were no less deeply and unanimously convinced that such a
reform as they have proposed was absolutely necessary to effect
the purposes of their appointment. It could not be unknown to
them that the hopes and expectations of the great body of
citizens, throughout this great empire, were turned with the
keenest anxiety to the event of their deliberations. They had
every reason to believe that the contrary sentiments agitated the
minds and bosoms of every external and internal foe to the
liberty and prosperity of the United States. They had seen in the
origin and progress of the experiment, the alacrity with which
the PROPOSITION, made by a single State (Virginia), towards a
partial amendment of the Confederation, had been attended to and
promoted. They had seen the LIBERTY ASSUMED by a VERY FEW
deputies from a VERY FEW States, convened at Annapolis, of
recommending a great and critical object, wholly foreign to their
commission, not only justified by the public opinion, but
actually carried into effect by twelve out of the thirteen
States. They had seen, in a variety of instances, assumptions by
Congress, not only of recommendatory, but of operative, powers,
warranted, in the public estimation, by occasions and objects
infinitely less urgent than those by which their conduct was to
be governed. They must have reflected, that in all great changes
of established governments, forms ought to give way to substance;
that a rigid adherence in such cases to the former, would render
nominal and nugatory the transcendent and precious right of the
people to ``abolish or alter their governments as to them shall
seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness,''2 since
it is impossible for the people spontaneously and universally to
move in concert towards their object; and it is therefore
essential that such changes be instituted by some INFORMAL AND
UNAUTHORIZED PROPOSITIONS, made by some patriotic and respectable
citizen or number of citizens. They must have recollected that it
was by this irregular and assumed privilege of proposing to the
people plans for their safety and happiness, that the States
were first united against the danger with which they were
threatened by their ancient government; that committees and
congresses were formed for concentrating their efforts and
defending their rights; and that CONVENTIONS were ELECTED in THE
SEVERAL STATES for establishing the constitutions under which
they are now governed; nor could it have been forgotten that no
little ill-timed scruples, no zeal for adhering to ordinary
forms, were anywhere seen, except in those who wished to indulge,
under these masks, their secret enmity to the substance contended
for. They must have borne in mind, that as the plan to be framed
and proposed was to be submitted TO THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES, the
disapprobation of this supreme authority would destroy it
forever; its approbation blot out antecedent errors and
irregularities. It might even have occurred to them, that where a
disposition to cavil prevailed, their neglect to execute the
degree of power vested in them, and still more their
recommendation of any measure whatever, not warranted by their
commission, would not less excite animadversion, than a
recommendation at once of a measure fully commensurate to the
national exigencies. Had the convention, under all these
impressions, and in the midst of all these considerations,
instead of exercising a manly confidence in their country, by
whose confidence they had been so peculiarly distinguished, and
of pointing out a system capable, in their judgment, of securing
its happiness, taken the cold and sullen resolution of
disappointing its ardent hopes, of sacrificing substance to
forms, of committing the dearest interests of their country to
the uncertainties of delay and the hazard of events, let me ask
the man who can raise his mind to one elevated conception, who
can awaken in his bosom one patriotic emotion, what judgment
ought to have been pronounced by the impartial world, by the
friends of mankind, by every virtuous citizen, on the conduct and
character of this assembly? Or if there be a man whose
propensity to condemn is susceptible of no control, let me then
ask what sentence he has in reserve for the twelve States who
USURPED THE POWER of sending deputies to the convention, a body
utterly unknown to their constitutions; for Congress, who
recommended the appointment of this body, equally unknown to the
Confederation; and for the State of New York, in particular,
which first urged and then complied with this unauthorized
interposition? But that the objectors may be disarmed of every
pretext, it shall be granted for a moment that the convention
were neither authorized by their commission, nor justified by
circumstances in proposing a Constitution for their country: does
it follow that the Constitution ought, for that reason alone, to
be rejected? If, according to the noble precept, it be lawful to
accept good advice even from an enemy, shall we set the ignoble
example of refusing such advice even when it is offered by our
friends? The prudent inquiry, in all cases, ought surely to be,
not so much FROM WHOM the advice comes, as whether the advice be
GOOD. The sum of what has been here advanced and proved is, that
the charge against the convention of exceeding their powers,
except in one instance little urged by the objectors, has no
foundation to support it; that if they had exceeded their powers,
they were not only warranted, but required, as the confidential
servants of their country, by the circumstances in which they
were placed, to exercise the liberty which they assume; and that
finally, if they had violated both their powers and their
obligations, in proposing a Constitution, this ought nevertheless
to be embraced, if it be calculated to accomplish the views and
happiness of the people of America. How far this character is due
to the Constitution, is the subject under investigation. PUBLIUS.

FEDERALIST No. 41
General View of the Powers Conferred by The Constitution
For the Independent Journal. 

MADISON

To the People of the State of New York:
THE Constitution proposed by the convention may be considered
under two general points of view. The FIRST relates to the sum or
quantity of power which it vests in the government, including
the restraints imposed on the States. The SECOND, to the
particular structure of the government, and the distribution of
this power among its several branches. Under the FIRST view of
the subject, two important questions arise: 1. Whether any part
of the powers transferred to the general government be
unnecessary or improper? 2. Whether the entire mass of them be
dangerous to the portion of jurisdiction left in the several
States? Is the aggregate power of the general government greater
than ought to have been vested in it? This is the FIRST
question. It cannot have escaped those who have attended with
candor to the arguments employed against the extensive powers of
the government, that the authors of them have very little
considered how far these powers were necessary means of attaining
a necessary end. They have chosen rather to dwell on the
inconveniences which must be unavoidably blended with all
political advantages; and on the possible abuses which must be
incident to every power or trust, of which a beneficial use can
be made. This method of handling the subject cannot impose on the
good sense of the people of America. It may display the subtlety
of the writer; it may open a boundless field for rhetoric and
declamation; it may inflame the passions of the unthinking, and
may confirm the prejudices of the misthinking: but cool and
candid people will at once reflect, that the purest of human
blessings must have a portion of alloy in them; that the choice
must always be made, if not of the lesser evil, at least of the
GREATER, not the PERFECT, good; and that in every political
institution, a power to advance the public happiness involves a
discretion which may be misapplied and abused. They will see,
therefore, that in all cases where power is to be conferred, the
point first to be decided is, whether such a power be necessary
to the public good; as the next will be, in case of an
affirmative decision, to guard as effectually as possible
against a perversion of the power to the public detriment. That
we may form a correct judgment on this subject, it will be proper
to review the several powers conferred on the government of the
Union; and that this may be the more conveniently done they may
be reduced into different classes as they relate to the following
different objects: 1. Security against foreign danger; 2.
Regulation of the intercourse with foreign nations; 3.
Maintenance of harmony and proper intercourse among the States;
4. Certain miscellaneous objects of general utility; 5.
Restraint of the States from certain injurious acts; 6.
Provisions for giving due efficacy to all these powers. The
powers falling within the FIRST class are those of declaring war
and granting letters of marque; of providing armies and fleets;
of regulating and calling forth the militia; of levying and
borrowing money. Security against foreign danger is one of the
primitive objects of civil society. It is an avowed and essential
object of the American Union. The powers requisite for attaining
it must be effectually confided to the federal councils. Is the
power of declaring war necessary? No man will answer this
question in the negative. It would be superfluous, therefore, to
enter into a proof of the affirmative. The existing Confederation
establishes this power in the most ample form. Is the power of
raising armies and equipping fleets necessary? This is involved
in the foregoing power. It is involved in the power of
self-defense. But was it necessary to give an INDEFINITE POWER
of raising TROOPS, as well as providing fleets; and of
maintaining both in PEACE, as well as in war? The answer to these
questions has been too far anticipated in another place to admit
an extensive discussion of them in this place. The answer indeed
seems to be so obvious and conclusive as scarcely to justify such
a discussion in any place. With what color of propriety could the
force necessary for defense be limited by those who cannot limit
the force of offense? If a federal Constitution could chain the
ambition or set bounds to the exertions of all other nations,
then indeed might it prudently chain the discretion of its own
government, and set bounds to the exertions for its own safety.
How could a readiness for war in time of peace be safely
prohibited, unless we could prohibit, in like manner, the
preparations and establishments of every hostile nation? The
means of security can only be regulated by the means and the
danger of attack. They will, in fact, be ever determined by these
rules, and by no others. It is in vain to oppose constitutional
barriers to the impulse of self-preservation. It is worse than in
vain; because it plants in the Constitution itself necessary
usurpations of power, every precedent of which is a germ of
unnecessary and multiplied repetitions. If one nation maintains
constantly a disciplined army, ready for the service of ambition
or revenge, it obliges the most pacific nations who may be within
the reach of its enterprises to take corresponding precautions.
The fifteenth century was the unhappy epoch of military
establishments in the time of peace. They were introduced by
Charles VII. of France. All Europe has followed, or been forced
into, the example. Had the example not been followed by other
nations, all Europe must long ago have worn the chains of a
universal monarch. Were every nation except France now to disband
its peace establishments, the same event might follow. The
veteran legions of Rome were an overmatch for the undisciplined
valor of all other nations and rendered her the mistress of the
world. Not the less true is it, that the liberties of Rome
proved the final victim to her military triumphs; and that the
liberties of Europe, as far as they ever existed, have, with few
exceptions, been the price of her military establishments. A
standing force, therefore, is a dangerous, at the same time that
it may be a necessary, provision. On the smallest scale it has
its inconveniences. On an extensive scale its consequences may be
fatal. On any scale it is an object of laudable circumspection
and precaution. A wise nation will combine all these
considerations; and, whilst it does not rashly preclude itself
from any resource which may become essential to its safety, will
exert all its prudence in diminishing both the necessity and the
danger of resorting to one which may be inauspicious to its
liberties. The clearest marks of this prudence are stamped on
the proposed Constitution. The Union itself, which it cements and
secures, destroys every pretext for a military establishment
which could be dangerous. America united, with a handful of
troops, or without a single soldier, exhibits a more forbidding
posture to foreign ambition than America disunited, with a
hundred thousand veterans ready for combat. It was remarked, on a
former occasion, that the want of this pretext had saved the
liberties of one nation in Europe. Being rendered by her insular
situation and her maritime resources impregnable to the armies of
her neighbors, the rulers of Great Britain have never been able,
by real or artificial dangers, to cheat the public into an
extensive peace establishment. The distance of the United States
from the powerful nations of the world gives them the same happy
security. A dangerous establishment can never be necessary or
plausible, so long as they continue a united people. But let it
never, for a moment, be forgotten that they are indebted for this
advantage to the Union alone. The moment of its dissolution will
be the date of a new order of things. The fears of the weaker, or
the ambition of the stronger States, or Confederacies, will set
the same example in the New, as Charles VII. did in the Old
World. The example will be followed here from the same motives
which produced universal imitation there. Instead of deriving
from our situation the precious advantage which Great Britain has
derived from hers, the face of America will be but a copy of that
of the continent of Europe. It will present liberty everywhere
crushed between standing armies and perpetual taxes. The fortunes
of disunited America will be even more disastrous than those of
Europe. The sources of evil in the latter are confined to her own
limits. No superior powers of another quarter of the globe
intrigue among her rival nations, inflame their mutual
animosities, and render them the instruments of foreign ambition,
jealousy, and revenge. In America the miseries springing from her
internal jealousies, contentions, and wars, would form a part
only of her lot. A plentiful addition of evils would have their
source in that relation in which Europe stands to this quarter of
the earth, and which no other quarter of the earth bears to
Europe. This picture of the consequences of disunion cannot be
too highly colored, or too often exhibited. Every man who loves
peace, every man who loves his country, every man who loves
liberty, ought to have it ever before his eyes, that he may
cherish in his heart a due attachment to the Union of America,
and be able to set a due value on the means of preserving it.
Next to the effectual establishment of the Union, the best
possible precaution against danger from standing armies is a
limitation of the term for which revenue may be appropriated to
their support. This precaution the Constitution has prudently
added. I will not repeat here the observations which I flatter
myself have placed this subject in a just and satisfactory
light. But it may not be improper to take notice of an argument
against this part of the Constitution, which has been drawn from
the policy and practice of Great Britain. It is said that the
continuance of an army in that kingdom requires an annual vote of
the legislature; whereas the American Constitution has lengthened
this critical period to two years. This is the form in which the
comparison is usually stated to the public: but is it a just
form? Is it a fair comparison? Does the British Constitution
restrain the parliamentary discretion to one year? Does the
American impose on the Congress appropriations for two years? On
the contrary, it cannot be unknown to the authors of the fallacy
themselves, that the British Constitution fixes no limit whatever
to the discretion of the legislature, and that the American ties
down the legislature to two years, as the longest admissible
term. Had the argument from the British example been truly
stated, it would have stood thus: The term for which supplies
may be appropriated to the army establishment, though unlimited
by the British Constitution, has nevertheless, in practice, been
limited by parliamentary discretion to a single year. Now, if in
Great Britain, where the House of Commons is elected for seven
years; where so great a proportion of the members are elected by
so small a proportion of the people; where the electors are so
corrupted by the representatives, and the representatives so
corrupted by the Crown, the representative body can possess a
power to make appropriations to the army for an indefinite term,
without desiring, or without daring, to extend the term beyond a
single year, ought not suspicion herself to blush, in pretending
that the representatives of the United States, elected FREELY by
the WHOLE BODY of the people, every SECOND YEAR, cannot be safely
intrusted with the discretion over such appropriations, expressly
limited to the short period of TWO YEARS? A bad cause seldom
fails to betray itself. Of this truth, the management of the
opposition to the federal government is an unvaried
exemplification. But among all the blunders which have been
committed, none is more striking than the attempt to enlist on
that side the prudent jealousy entertained by the people, of
standing armies. The attempt has awakened fully the public
attention to that important subject; and has led to
investigations which must terminate in a thorough and universal
conviction, not only that the constitution has provided the most
effectual guards against danger from that quarter, but that
nothing short of a Constitution fully adequate to the national
defense and the preservation of the Union, can save America from
as many standing armies as it may be split into States or
Confederacies, and from such a progressive augmentation, of these
establishments in each, as will render them as burdensome to the
properties and ominous to the liberties of the people, as any
establishment that can become necessary, under a united and
efficient government, must be tolerable to the former and safe to
the latter. The palpable necessity of the power to provide and
maintain a navy has protected that part of the Constitution
against a spirit of censure, which has spared few other parts. It
must, indeed, be numbered among the greatest blessings of
America, that as her Union will be the only source of her
maritime strength, so this will be a principal source of her
security against danger from abroad. In this respect our
situation bears another likeness to the insular advantage of
Great Britain. The batteries most capable of repelling foreign
enterprises on our safety, are happily such as can never be
turned by a perfidious government against our liberties. The
inhabitants of the Atlantic frontier are all of them deeply
interested in this provision for naval protection, and if they
have hitherto been suffered to sleep quietly in their beds; if
their property has remained safe against the predatory spirit of
licentious adventurers; if their maritime towns have not yet
been compelled to ransom themselves from the terrors of a
conflagration, by yielding to the exactions of daring and sudden
invaders, these instances of good fortune are not to be ascribed
to the capacity of the existing government for the protection of
those from whom it claims allegiance, but to causes that are
fugitive and fallacious. If we except perhaps Virginia and
Maryland, which are peculiarly vulnerable on their eastern
frontiers, no part of the Union ought to feel more anxiety on
this subject than New York. Her seacoast is extensive. A very
important district of the State is an island. The State itself is
penetrated by a large navigable river for more than fifty
leagues. The great emporium of its commerce, the great reservoir
of its wealth, lies every moment at the mercy of events, and may
almost be regarded as a hostage for ignominious compliances with
the dictates of a foreign enemy, or even with the rapacious
demands of pirates and barbarians. Should a war be the result of
the precarious situation of European affairs, and all the unruly
passions attending it be let loose on the ocean, our escape from
insults and depredations, not only on that element, but every
part of the other bordering on it, will be truly miraculous. In
the present condition of America, the States more immediately
exposed to these calamities have nothing to hope from the phantom
of a general government which now exists; and if their single
resources were equal to the task of fortifying themselves against
the danger, the object to be protected would be almost consumed
by the means of protecting them. The power of regulating and
calling forth the militia has been already sufficiently
vindicated and explained. The power of levying and borrowing
money, being the sinew of that which is to be exerted in the
national defense, is properly thrown into the same class with
it. This power, also, has been examined already with much
attention, and has, I trust, been clearly shown to be necessary,
both in the extent and form given to it by the Constitution. I
will address one additional reflection only to those who contend
that the power ought to have been restrained to external
taxation by which they mean, taxes on articles imported from
other countries. It cannot be doubted that this will always be a
valuable source of revenue; that for a considerable time it must
be a principal source; that at this moment it is an essential
one. But we may form very mistaken ideas on this subject, if we
do not call to mind in our calculations, that the extent of
revenue drawn from foreign commerce must vary with the
variations, both in the extent and the kind of imports; and that
these variations do not correspond with the progress of
population, which must be the general measure of the public
wants. As long as agriculture continues the sole field of labor,
the importation of manufactures must increase as the consumers
multiply. As soon as domestic manufactures are begun by the hands
not called for by agriculture, the imported manufactures will
decrease as the numbers of people increase. In a more remote
stage, the imports may consist in a considerable part of raw
materials, which will be wrought into articles for exportation,
and will, therefore, require rather the encouragement of
bounties, than to be loaded with discouraging duties. A system of
government, meant for duration, ought to contemplate these
revolutions, and be able to accommodate itself to them. Some,
who have not denied the necessity of the power of taxation, have
grounded a very fierce attack against the Constitution, on the
language in which it is defined. It has been urged and echoed,
that the power ``to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and
excises, to pay the debts, and provide for the common defense and
general welfare of the United States,'' amounts to an unlimited
commission to exercise every power which may be alleged to be
necessary for the common defense or general welfare. No stronger
proof could be given of the distress under which these writers
labor for objections, than their stooping to such a
misconstruction. Had no other enumeration or definition of the
powers of the Congress been found in the Constitution, than the
general expressions just cited, the authors of the objection
might have had some color for it; though it would have been
difficult to find a reason for so awkward a form of describing an
authority to legislate in all possible cases. A power to destroy
the freedom of the press, the trial by jury, or even to regulate
the course of descents, or the forms of conveyances, must be very
singularly expressed by the terms ``to raise money for the
general welfare. ''But what color can the objection have, when a
specification of the objects alluded to by these general terms
immediately follows, and is not even separated by a longer pause
than a semicolon? If the different parts of the same instrument
ought to be so expounded, as to give meaning to every part which
will bear it, shall one part of the same sentence be excluded
altogether from a share in the meaning; and shall the more
doubtful and indefinite terms be retained in their full extent,
and the clear and precise expressions be denied any signification
whatsoever? For what purpose could the enumeration of particular
powers be inserted, if these and all others were meant to be
included in the preceding general power? Nothing is more natural
nor common than first to use a general phrase, and then to
explain and qualify it by a recital of particulars. But the idea
of an enumeration of particulars which neither explain nor
qualify the general meaning, and can have no other effect than to
confound and mislead, is an absurdity, which, as we are reduced
to the dilemma of charging either on the authors of the objection
or on the authors of the Constitution, we must take the liberty
of supposing, had not its origin with the latter. The objection
here is the more extraordinary, as it appears that the language
used by the convention is a copy from the articles of
Confederation. The objects of the Union among the States, as
described in article third, are ``their common defense, security
of their liberties, and mutual and general welfare. '' The terms
of article eighth are still more identical: ``All charges of war
and all other expenses that shall be incurred for the common
defense or general welfare, and allowed by the United States in
Congress, shall be defrayed out of a common treasury,'' etc. A
similar language again occurs in article ninth. Construe either
of these articles by the rules which would justify the
construction put on the new Constitution, and they vest in the
existing Congress a power to legislate in all cases whatsoever.
But what would have been thought of that assembly, if, attaching
themselves to these general expressions, and disregarding the
specifications which ascertain and limit their import, they had
exercised an unlimited power of providing for the common defense
and general welfare? I appeal to the objectors themselves,
whether they would in that case have employed the same reasoning
in justification of Congress as they now make use of against the
convention. How difficult it is for error to escape its own
condemnation! PUBLIUS. 


FEDERALIST No. 42
The Powers Conferred by the Constitution Further Considered
From the New York Packet. Tuesday, January 22, 1788. 

MADISON

To the People of the State of New York:
THE SECOND class of powers, lodged in the general government,
consists of those which regulate the intercourse with foreign
nations, to wit: to make treaties; to send and receive
ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls; to define and
punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas, and
offenses against the law of nations; to regulate foreign
commerce, including a power to prohibit, after the year 1808, the
importation of slaves, and to lay an intermediate duty of ten
dollars per head, as a discouragement to such importations. This
class of powers forms an obvious and essential branch of the
federal administration. If we are to be one nation in any
respect, it clearly ought to be in respect to other nations. The
powers to make treaties and to send and receive ambassadors,
speak their own propriety. Both of them are comprised in the
articles of Confederation, with this difference only, that the 
former is disembarrassed, by the plan of the convention, of an
exception, under which treaties might be substantially frustrated
by regulations of the States; and that a power of appointing and
receiving ``other public ministers and consuls,'' is expressly
and very properly added to the former provision concerning
ambassadors. The term ambassador, if taken strictly, as seems to
be required by the second of the articles of Confederation,
comprehends the highest grade only of public ministers, and
excludes the grades which the United States will be most likely
to prefer, where foreign embassies may be necessary. And under no
latitude of construction will the term comprehend consuls. Yet it
has been found expedient, and has been the practice of Congress,
to employ the inferior grades of public ministers, and to send
and receive consuls. It is true, that where treaties of commerce
stipulate for the mutual appointment of consuls, whose functions
are connected with commerce, the admission of foreign consuls may
fall within the power of making commercial treaties; and that
where no such treaties exist, the mission of American consuls
into foreign countries may PERHAPS be covered under the
authority, given by the ninth article of the Confederation, to
appoint all such civil officers as may be necessary for managing
the general affairs of the United States. But the admission of
consuls into the United States, where no previous treaty has
stipulated it, seems to have been nowhere provided for. A supply
of the omission is one of the lesser instances in which the
convention have improved on the model before them. But the most
minute provisions become important when they tend to obviate the
necessity or the pretext for gradual and unobserved usurpations
of power. A list of the cases in which Congress have been
betrayed, or forced by the defects of the Confederation, into
violations of their chartered authorities, would not a little
surprise those who have paid no attention to the subject; and
would be no inconsiderable argument in favor of the new
Constitution, which seems to have provided no less studiously for
the lesser, than the more obvious and striking defects of the
old. The power to define and punish piracies and felonies
committed on the high seas, and offenses against the law of
nations, belongs with equal propriety to the general government,
and is a still greater improvement on the articles of
Confederation. These articles contain no provision for the case
of offenses against the law of nations; and consequently leave
it in the power of any indiscreet member to embroil the
Confederacy with foreign nations. The provision of the federal
articles on the subject of piracies and felonies extends no
further than to the establishment of courts for the trial of
these offenses. The definition of piracies might, perhaps,
without inconveniency, be left to the law of nations; though a
legislative definition of them is found in most municipal codes.
A definition of felonies on the high seas is evidently
requisite. Felony is a term of loose signification, even in the
common law of England; and of various import in the statute law
of that kingdom. But neither the common nor the statute law of
that, or of any other nation, ought to be a standard for the
proceedings of this, unless previously made its own by
legislative adoption. The meaning of the term, as defined in the
codes of the several States, would be as impracticable as the
former would be a dishonorable and illegitimate guide. It is not
precisely the same in any two of the States; and varies in each
with every revision of its criminal laws. For the sake of
certainty and uniformity, therefore, the power of defining
felonies in this case was in every respect necessary and proper.
The regulation of foreign commerce, having fallen within several
views which have been taken of this subject, has been too fully
discussed to need additional proofs here of its being properly
submitted to the federal administration. It were doubtless to be
wished, that the power of prohibiting the importation of slaves
had not been postponed until the year 1808, or rather that it had
been suffered to have immediate operation. But it is not
difficult to account, either for this restriction on the general
government, or for the manner in which the whole clause is
expressed. It ought to be considered as a great point gained in
favor of humanity, that a period of twenty years may terminate
forever, within these States, a traffic which has so long and so
loudly upbraided the barbarism of modern policy; that within that
period, it will receive a considerable discouragement from the
federal government, and may be totally abolished, by a
concurrence of the few States which continue the unnatural
traffic, in the prohibitory example which has been given by so
great a majority of the Union. Happy would it be for the
unfortunate Africans, if an equal prospect lay before them of
being redeemed from the oppressions of their European brethren!
Attempts have been made to pervert this clause into an objection
against the Constitution, by representing it on one side as a
criminal toleration of an illicit practice, and on another as
calculated to prevent voluntary and beneficial emigrations from
Europe to America. I mention these misconstructions, not with a
view to give them an answer, for they deserve none, but as
specimens of the manner and spirit in which some have thought fit
to conduct their opposition to the proposed government. The
powers included in the THIRD class are those which provide for
the harmony and proper intercourse among the States. Under this
head might be included the particular restraints imposed on the
authority of the States, and certain powers of the judicial
department; but the former are reserved for a distinct class, and
the latter will be particularly examined when we arrive at the
structure and organization of the government. I shall confine
myself to a cursory review of the remaining powers comprehended
under this third description, to wit: to regulate commerce among
the several States and the Indian tribes; to coin money, regulate
the value thereof, and of foreign coin; to provide for the
punishment of counterfeiting the current coin and secureties of
the United States; to fix the standard of weights and measures;
to establish a uniform rule of naturalization, and uniform laws
of bankruptcy, to prescribe the manner in which the public acts,
records, and judicial proceedings of each State shall be proved,
and the effect they shall have in other States; and to establish
post offices and post roads. The defect of power in the existing
Confederacy to regulate the commerce between its several members,
is in the number of those which have been clearly pointed out by
experience. To the proofs and remarks which former papers have
brought into view on this subject, it may be added that without
this supplemental provision, the great and essential power of
regulating foreign commerce would have been incomplete and
ineffectual. A very material object of this power was the relief
of the States which import and export through other States, from
the improper contributions levied on them by the latter. Were
these at liberty to regulate the trade between State and State,
it must be foreseen that ways would be found out to load the
articles of import and export, during the passage through their
jurisdiction, with duties which would fall on the makers of the
latter and the consumers of the former. We may be assured by past
experience, that such a practice would be introduced by future
contrivances; and both by that and a common knowledge of human
affairs, that it would nourish unceasing animosities, and not
improbably terminate in serious interruptions of the public
tranquillity. To those who do not view the question through the
medium of passion or of interest, the desire of the commercial
States to collect, in any form, an indirect revenue from their
uncommercial neighbors, must appear not less impolitic than it is
unfair; since it would stimulate the injured party, by resentment
as well as interest, to resort to less convenient channels for
their foreign trade. But the mild voice of reason, pleading the
cause of an enlarged and permanent interest, is but too often
drowned, before public bodies as well as individuals, by the
clamors of an impatient avidity for immediate and immoderate
gain. The necessity of a superintending authority over the
reciprocal trade of confederated States, has been illustrated by
other examples as well as our own. In Switzerland, where the
Union is so very slight, each canton is obliged to allow to
merchandises a passage through its jurisdiction into other
cantons, without an augmentation of the tolls. In Germany it is a
law of the empire, that the princes and states shall not lay
tolls or customs on bridges, rivers, or passages, without the
consent of the emperor and the diet; though it appears from a
quotation in an antecedent paper, that the practice in this, as
in many other instances in that confederacy, has not followed the
law, and has produced there the mischiefs which have been
foreseen here. Among the restraints imposed by the Union of the
Netherlands on its members, one is, that they shall not establish
imposts disadvantageous to their neighbors, without the general
permission. The regulation of commerce with the Indian tribes is
very properly unfettered from two limitations in the articles of
Confederation, which render the provision obscure and
contradictory. The power is there restrained to Indians, not
members of any of the States, and is not to violate or infringe
the legislative right of any State within its own limits. What
description of Indians are to be deemed members of a State, is
not yet settled, and has been a question of frequent perplexity
and contention in the federal councils. And how the trade with
Indians, though not members of a State, yet residing within its
legislative jurisdiction, can be regulated by an external
authority, without so far intruding on the internal rights of
legislation, is absolutely incomprehensible. This is not the only
case in which the articles of Confederation have inconsiderately
endeavored to accomplish impossibilities; to reconcile a partial
sovereignty in the Union, with complete sovereignty in the
States; to subvert a mathematical axiom, by taking away a part,
and letting the whole remain. All that need be remarked on the
power to coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign
coin, is, that by providing for this last case, the Constitution
has supplied a material omission in the articles of
Confederation. The authority of the existing Congress is
restrained to the regulation of coin STRUCK by their own
authority, or that of the respective States. It must be seen at
once that the proposed uniformity in the VALUE of the current
coin might be destroyed by subjecting that of foreign coin to the
different regulations of the different States. The punishment of
counterfeiting the public securities, as well as the current
coin, is submitted of course to that authority which is to secure
the value of both. The regulation of weights and measures is
transferred from the articles of Confederation, and is founded on
like considerations with the preceding power of regulating coin.
The dissimilarity in the rules of naturalization has long been
remarked as a fault in our system, and as laying a foundation for
intricate and delicate questions. In the fourth article of the
Confederation, it is declared ``that the FREE INHABITANTS of each
of these States, paupers, vagabonds, and fugitives from justice,
excepted, shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of
FREE CITIZENS in the several States; and THE PEOPLE of each State
shall, in every other, enjoy all the privileges of trade and
commerce,'' etc. There is a confusion of language here, which is
remarkable. Why the terms FREE INHABITANTS are used in one part
of the article, FREE CITIZENS in another, and PEOPLE in another;
or what was meant by superadding to ``all privileges and
immunities of free citizens,'' ``all the privileges of trade and
commerce,'' 
cannot easily be determined. It seems to be a construction
scarcely avoidable, however, that those who come under the
denomination of FREE INHABITANTS of a State, although not
citizens of such State, are entitled, in every other State, to
all the privileges of FREE CITIZENS of the latter; that is, to
greater privileges than they may be entitled to in their own
State: so that it may be in the power of a particular State, or
rather every State is laid under a necessity, not only to confer
the rights of citizenship in other States upon any whom it may
admit to such rights within itself, but upon any whom it may
allow to become inhabitants within its jurisdiction. But were an
exposition of the term ``inhabitants'' to be admitted which
would confine the stipulated privileges to citizens alone, the
difficulty is diminished only, not removed. The very improper
power would still be retained by each State, of naturalizing
aliens in every other State. In one State, residence for a short
term confirms all the rights of citizenship: in another,
qualifications of greater importance are required. An alien,
therefore, legally incapacitated for certain rights in the
latter, may, by previous residence only in the former, elude his
incapacity; and thus the law of one State be preposterously
rendered paramount to the law of another, within the jurisdiction
of the other. We owe it to mere casualty, that very serious
embarrassments on this subject have been hitherto escaped. By the
laws of several States, certain descriptions of aliens, who had
rendered themselves obnoxious, were laid under interdicts
inconsistent not only with the rights of citizenship but with the
privilege of residence. What would have been the consequence, if
such persons, by residence or otherwise, had acquired the
character of citizens under the laws of another State, and then
asserted their rights as such, both to residence and citizenship,
within the State proscribing them? Whatever the legal
consequences might have been, other consequences would probably
have resulted, of too serious a nature not to be provided
against. The new Constitution has accordingly, with great
propriety, made provision against them, and all others proceeding
from the defect of the Confederation on this head, by authorizing
the general government to establish a uniform rule of
naturalization throughout the United States. The power of
establishing uniform laws of bankruptcy is so intimately
connected with the regulation of commerce, and will prevent so
many frauds where the parties or their property may lie or be
removed into different States, that the expediency of it seems
not likely to be drawn into question. The power of prescribing
by general laws, the manner in which the public acts, records and
judicial proceedings of each State shall be proved, and the
effect they shall have in other States, is an evident and
valuable improvement on the clause relating to this subject in
the articles of Confederation. The meaning of the latter is
extremely indeterminate, and can be of little importance under
any interpretation which it will bear. The power here established
may be rendered a very convenient instrument of justice, and be
particularly beneficial on the borders of contiguous States,
where the effects liable to justice may be suddenly and secretly
translated, in any stage of the process, within a foreign
jurisdiction. The power of establishing post roads must, in
every view, be a harmless power, and may, perhaps, by judicious
management, become productive of great public conveniency.
Nothing which tends to facilitate the intercourse between the
States can be deemed unworthy of the public care. PUBLIUS. 

FEDERALIST No. 43
The Same Subject Continued(The Powers Conferred by the
Constitution Further Considered)
For the Independent Journal. 

MADISON

To the People of the State of New York:
THE FOURTH class comprises the following miscellaneous powers:1.
A power ``to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by
securing, for a limited time, to authors and inventors, the
exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.
''The utility of this power will scarcely be questioned. The
copyright of authors has been solemnly adjudged, in Great
Britain, to be a right of common law. The right to useful
inventions seems with equal reason to belong to the inventors.
The public good fully coincides in both cases with the claims of
individuals. The States cannot separately make effectual
provisions for either of the cases, and most of them have
anticipated the decision of this point, by laws passed at the
instance of Congress. 2. ``To exercise exclusive legislation, in
all cases whatsoever, over such district (not exceeding ten miles
square) as may, by cession of particular States and the
acceptance of Congress, become the seat of the government of the
United States; and to exercise like authority over all places
purchased by the consent of the legislatures of the States in
which the same shall be, for the erection of forts, magazines,
arsenals, dockyards, and other needful buildings. ''The
indispensable necessity of complete authority at the seat of
government, carries its own evidence with it. It is a power
exercised by every legislature of the Union, I might say of the
world, by virtue of its general supremacy. Without it, not only
the public authority might be insulted and its proceedings
interrupted with impunity; but a dependence of the members of the
general government on the State comprehending the seat of the
government, for protection in the exercise of their duty, might
bring on the national councils an imputation of awe or influence,
equally dishonorable to the government and dissatisfactory to the
other members of the Confederacy. This consideration has the more
weight, as the gradual accumulation of public improvements at the
stationary residence of the government would be both too great a
public pledge to be left in the hands of a single State, and
would create so many obstacles to a removal of the government, as
still further to abridge its necessary independence. The extent
of this federal district is sufficiently circumscribed to satisfy
every jealousy of an opposite nature. And as it is to be
appropriated to this use with the consent of the State ceding it;
as the State will no doubt provide in the compact for the rights
and the consent of the citizens inhabiting it; as the inhabitants
will find sufficient inducements of interest to become willing
parties to the cession; as they will have had their voice in the
election of the government which is to exercise authority over
them; as a municipal legislature for local purposes, derived from
their own suffrages, will of course be allowed them; and as the
authority of the legislature of the State, and of the inhabitants
of the ceded part of it, to concur in the cession, will be
derived from the whole people of the State in their adoption of
the Constitution, every imaginable objection seems to be
obviated. The necessity of a like authority over forts,
magazines, etc. , established by the general government, is not
less evident. The public money expended on such places, and the
public property deposited in them, requires that they should be
exempt from the authority of the particular State. Nor would it
be proper for the places on which the security of the entire
Union may depend, to be in any degree dependent on a particular
member of it. All objections and scruples are here also obviated,
by requiring the concurrence of the States concerned, in every
such establishment. 3. ``To declare the punishment of treason,
but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or
forfeiture, except during the life of the person attained. ''As
treason may be committed against the United States, the authority
of the United States ought to be enabled to punish it. But as
new-fangled and artificial treasons have been the great engines
by which violent factions, the natural offspring of free
government, have usually wreaked their alternate malignity on
each other, the convention have, with great judgment, opposed a
barrier to this peculiar danger, by inserting a constitutional
definition of the crime, fixing the proof necessary for
conviction of it, and restraining the Congress, even in punishing
it, from extending the consequences of guilt beyond the person of
its author. 4. ``To admit new States into the Union; but no new
State shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any
other State; nor any State be formed by the junction of two or
more States, or parts of States, without the consent of the
legislatures of the States concerned, as well as of the Congress.
''In the articles of Confederation, no provision is found on this
important subject. Canada was to be admitted of right, on her
joining in the measures of the United States; and the other
COLONIES, by which were evidently meant the other British
colonies, at the discretion of nine States. The eventual
establishment of NEW STATES seems to have been overlooked by the
compilers of that instrument. We have seen the inconvenience of
this omission, and the assumption of power into which Congress
have been led by it. With great propriety, therefore, has the new
system supplied the defect. The general precaution, that no new
States shall be formed, without the concurrence of the federal
authority, and that of the States concerned, is consonant to the
principles which ought to govern such transactions. The
particular precaution against the erection of new States, by the
partition of a State without its consent, quiets the jealousy of
the larger States; as that of the smaller is quieted by a like
precaution, against a junction of States without their consent.
5. ``To dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations
respecting the territory or other property belonging to the
United States, with a proviso, that nothing in the Constitution
shall be so construed as to prejudice any claims of the United
States, or of any particular State. ''This is a power of very
great importance, and required by considerations similar to those
which show the propriety of the former. The proviso annexed is
proper in itself, and was probably rendered absolutely necessary
by jealousies and questions concerning the Western territory
sufficiently known to the public. 6. ``To guarantee to every
State in the Union a republican form of government; to protect
each of them against invasion; and on application of the
legislature, or of the executive (when the legislature cannot be
convened), against domestic violence. ''In a confederacy founded
on republican principles, and composed of republican members, the
superintending government ought clearly to possess authority to
defend the system against aristocratic or monarchial
innovations. The more intimate the nature of such a union may be,
the greater interest have the members in the political
institutions of each other; and the greater right to insist that
the forms of government under which the compact was entered into
should be SUBSTANTIALLY maintained. But a right implies a remedy;
and where else could the remedy be deposited, than where it is
deposited by the Constitution? Governments of dissimilar
principles and forms have been found less adapted to a federal
coalition of any sort, than those of a kindred nature. ``As the
confederate republic of Germany,'' says Montesquieu, ``consists
of free cities and petty states, subject to different princes,
experience shows us that it is more imperfect than that of
Holland and Switzerland. '' ``Greece was undone,'' he adds, ``as
soon as the king of Macedon obtained a seat among the
Amphictyons. '' In the latter case, no doubt, the
disproportionate force, as well as the monarchical form, of the
new confederate, had its share of influence on the events. It may
possibly be asked, what need there could be of such a
precaution, and whether it may not become a pretext for
alterations in the State governments, without the concurrence of
the States themselves. These questions admit of ready answers. If
the interposition of the general government should not be
needed, the provision for such an event will be a harmless
superfluity only in the Constitution. But who can say what
experiments may be produced by the caprice of particular States,
by the ambition of enterprising leaders, or by the intrigues and
influence of foreign powers? To the second question it may be
answered, that if the general government should interpose by
virtue of this constitutional authority, it will be, of course,
bound to pursue the authority. But the authority extends no
further than to a GUARANTY of a republican form of government,
which supposes a pre-existing government of the form which is to
be guaranteed. As long, therefore, as the existing republican
forms are continued by the States, they are guaranteed by the
federal Constitution. Whenever the States may choose to
substitute other republican forms, they have a right to do so,
and to claim the federal guaranty for the latter. The only
restriction imposed on them is, that they shall not exchange
republican for antirepublican Constitutions; a restriction
which, it is presumed, will hardly be considered as a grievance.
A protection against invasion is due from every society to the
parts composing it. The latitude of the expression here used
seems to secure each State, not only against foreign hostility,
but against ambitious or vindictive enterprises of its more
powerful neighbors. The history, both of ancient and modern
confederacies, proves that the weaker members of the union ought
not to be insensible to the policy of this article. Protection
against domestic violence is added with equal propriety. It has
been remarked, that even among the Swiss cantons, which, properly
speaking, are not under one government, provision is made for
this object; and the history of that league informs us that
mutual aid is frequently claimed and afforded; and as well by
the most democratic, as the other cantons. A recent and
well-known event among ourselves has warned us to be prepared for
emergencies of a like nature. At first view, it might seem not
to square with the republican theory, to suppose, either that a
majority have not the right, or that a minority will have the
force, to subvert a government; and consequently, that the
federal interposition can never be required, but when it would be
improper. But theoretic reasoning, in this as in most other
cases, must be qualified by the lessons of practice. Why may not
illicit combinations, for purposes of violence, be formed as
well by a majority of a State, especially a small State as by a
majority of a county, or a district of the same State; and if
the authority of the State ought, in the latter case, to protect
the local magistracy, ought not the federal authority, in the
former, to support the State authority? Besides, there are
certain parts of the State constitutions which are so interwoven
with the federal Constitution, that a violent blow cannot be
given to the one without communicating the wound to the other.
Insurrections in a State will rarely induce a federal
interposition, unless the number concerned in them bear some
proportion to the friends of government. It will be much better
that the violence in such cases should be repressed by the
superintending power, than that the majority should be left to
maintain their cause by a bloody and obstinate contest. The
existence of a right to interpose, will generally prevent the
necessity of exerting it. Is it true that force and right are
necessarily on the same side in republican governments? May not
the minor party possess such a superiority of pecuniary
resources, of military talents and experience, or of secret
succors from foreign powers, as will render it superior also in
an appeal to the sword? May not a more compact and advantageous
position turn the scale on the same side, against a superior
number so situated as to be less capable of a prompt and
collected exertion of its strength? Nothing can be more
chimerical than to imagine that in a trial of actual force,
victory may be calculated by the rules which prevail in a census
of the inhabitants, or which determine the event of an election! 
May it not happen, in fine, that the minority of CITIZENS may
become a majority of PERSONS, by the accession of alien
residents, of a casual concourse of adventurers, or of those whom
the constitution of the State has not admitted to the rights of
suffrage? I take no notice of an unhappy species of population
abounding in some of the States, who, during the calm of regular
government, are sunk below the level of men; but who, in the
tempestuous scenes of civil violence, may emerge into the human
character, and give a superiority of strength to any party with
which they may associate themselves. In cases where it may be
doubtful on which side justice lies, what better umpires could
be desired by two violent factions, flying to arms, and tearing a
State to pieces, than the representatives of confederate States,
not heated by the local flame? To the impartiality of judges,
they would unite the affection of friends. Happy would it be if
such a remedy for its infirmities could be enjoyed by all free
governments; if a project equally effectual could be established
for the universal peace of mankind! Should it be asked, what is
to be the redress for an insurrection pervading all the States,
and comprising a superiority of the entire force, though not a
constitutional right? the answer must be, that such a case, as
it would be without the compass of human remedies, so it is
fortunately not within the compass of human probability; and
that it is a sufficient recommendation of the federal
Constitution, that it diminishes the risk of a calamity for which
no possible constitution can provide a cure. Among the
advantages of a confederate republic enumerated by Montesquieu,
an important one is, ``that should a popular insurrection happen
in one of the States, the others are able to quell it. Should
abuses creep into one part, they are reformed by those that
remain sound. ''7. ``To consider all debts contracted, and
engagements entered into, before the adoption of this
Constitution, as being no less valid against the United States,
under this Constitution, than under the Confederation. ''This
can only be considered as a declaratory proposition; and may have
been inserted, among other reasons, for the satisfaction of the
foreign creditors of the United States, who cannot be strangers
to the pretended doctrine, that a change in the political form of
civil society has the magical effect of dissolving its moral
obligations. Among the lesser criticisms which have been
exercised on the Constitution, it has been remarked that the
validity of engagements ought to have been asserted in favor of
the United States, as well as against them; and in the spirit
which usually characterizes little critics, the omission has been
transformed and magnified into a plot against the national
rights. The authors of this discovery may be told, what few
others need to be informed of, that as engagements are in their
nature reciprocal, an assertion of their validity on one side,
necessarily involves a validity on the other side; and that as
the article is merely declaratory, the establishment of the
principle in one case is sufficient for every case. They may be
further told, that every constitution must limit its precautions
to dangers that are not altogether imaginary; and that no real
danger can exist that the government would DARE, with, or even
without, this constitutional declaration before it, to remit the
debts justly due to the public, on the pretext here condemned. 8.
``To provide for amendments to be ratified by three fourths of
the States under two exceptions only. ''That useful alterations
will be suggested by experience, could not but be foreseen. It
was requisite, therefore, that a mode for introducing them should
be provided. The mode preferred by the convention seems to be
stamped with every mark of propriety. It guards equally against
that extreme facility, which would render the Constitution too
mutable; and that extreme difficulty, which might perpetuate its
discovered faults. It, moreover, equally enables the general and
the State governments to originate the amendment of errors, as
they may be pointed out by the experience on one side, or on the
other. The exception in favor of the equality of suffrage in the
Senate, was probably meant as a palladium to the residuary
sovereignty of the States, implied and secured by that principle
of representation in one branch of the legislature; and was
probably insisted on by the States particularly attached to that
equality. The other exception must have been admitted on the same
considerations which produced the privilege defended by it. 9.
``The ratification of the conventions of nine States shall be
sufficient for the establishment of this Constitution between the
States, ratifying the same. ''This article speaks for itself.
The express authority of the people alone could give due validity
to the Constitution. To have required the unanimous ratification
of the thirteen States, would have subjected the essential
interests of the whole to the caprice or corruption of a single
member. It would have marked a want of foresight in the
convention, which our own experience would have rendered
inexcusable. Two questions of a very delicate nature present
themselves on this occasion: 1. On what principle the
Confederation, which stands in the solemn form of a compact among
the States, can be superseded without the unanimous consent of
the parties to it? 2. What relation is to subsist between the
nine or more States ratifying the Constitution, and the remaining
few who do not become parties to it? The first question is
answered at once by recurring to the absolute necessity of the
case; to the great principle of self-preservation; to the
transcendent law of nature and of nature's God, which declares
that the safety and happiness of society are the objects at which
all political institutions aim, and to which all such
institutions must be sacrificed. PERHAPS, also, an answer may be
found without searching beyond the principles of the compact
itself. It has been heretofore noted among the defects of the
Confederation, that in many of the States it had received no
higher sanction than a mere legislative ratification. The
principle of reciprocality seems to require that its obligation
on the other States should be reduced to the same standard. A
compact between independent sovereigns, founded on ordinary acts
of legislative authority, can pretend to no higher validity than
a league or treaty between the parties. It is an established
doctrine on the subject of treaties, that all the articles are
mutually conditions of each other; that a breach of any one
article is a breach of the whole treaty; and that a breach,
committed by either of the parties, absolves the others, and
authorizes them, if they please, to pronounce the compact
violated and void. Should it unhappily be necessary to appeal to
these delicate truths for a justification for dispensing with
the consent of particular States to a dissolution of the federal
pact, will not the complaining parties find it a difficult task
to answer the MULTIPLIED and IMPORTANT infractions with which
they may be confronted? The time has been when it was incumbent
on us all to veil the ideas which this paragraph exhibits. The
scene is now changed, and with it the part which the same motives
dictate. The second question is not less delicate; and the
flattering prospect of its being merely hypothetical forbids an
overcurious discussion of it. It is one of those cases which must
be left to provide for itself. In general, it may be observed,
that although no political relation can subsist between the
assenting and dissenting States, yet the moral relations will
remain uncancelled. The claims of justice, both on one side and
on the other, will be in force, and must be fulfilled; the
rights of humanity must in all cases be duly and mutually
respected; whilst considerations of a common interest, and,
above all, the remembrance of the endearing scenes which are
past, and the anticipation of a speedy triumph over the obstacles
to reunion, will, it is hoped, not urge in vain MODERATION on one
side, and PRUDENCE on the other. PUBLIUS. 


FEDERALIST No. 44

Restrictions on the Authority of the Several States
From the New York Packet. Friday, January 25, 1788. 

MADISON

To the People of the State of New York:
A FIFTH class of provisions in favor of the federal authority
consists of the following restrictions on the authority of the
several States:1. ``No State shall enter into any treaty,
alliance, or confederation; grant letters of marque and reprisal;
coin money; emit bills of credit; make any thing but gold and
silver a legal tender in payment of debts; pass any bill of
attainder, ex-post-facto law, or law impairing the obligation of
contracts; or grant any title of nobility. ''The prohibition
against treaties, alliances, and confederations makes a part of
the existing articles of Union; and for reasons which need no
explanation, is copied into the new Constitution. The prohibition
of letters of marque is another part of the old system, but is
somewhat extended in the new. According to the former, letters of
marque could be granted by the States after a declaration of war;
according to the latter, these licenses must be obtained, as well
during war as previous to its declaration, from the government of
the United States. This alteration is fully justified by the
advantage of uniformity in all points which relate to foreign
powers; and of immediate responsibility to the nation in all
those for whose conduct the nation itself is to be responsible.
The right of coining money, which is here taken from the States,
was left in their hands by the Confederation, as a concurrent
right with that of Congress, under an exception in favor of the
exclusive right of Congress to regulate the alloy and value. In
this instance, also, the new provision is an improvement on the
old. Whilst the alloy and value depended on the general
authority, a right of coinage in the particular States could have
no other effect than to multiply expensive mints and diversify
the forms and weights of the circulating pieces. The latter
inconveniency defeats one purpose for which the power was
originally submitted to the federal head; and as far as the
former might prevent an inconvenient remittance of gold and
silver to the central mint for recoinage, the end can be as well
attained by local mints established under the general authority.
The extension of the prohibition to bills of credit must give
pleasure to every citizen, in proportion to his love of justice
and his knowledge of the true springs of public prosperity. The
loss which America has sustained since the peace, from the
pestilent effects of paper money on the necessary confidence
between man and man, on the necessary confidence in the public
councils, on the industry and morals of the people, and on the
character of republican government, constitutes an enormous debt
against the States chargeable with this unadvised measure, which
must long remain unsatisfied; or rather an accumulation of guilt,
which can be expiated no otherwise than by a voluntary sacrifice
on the altar of justice, of the power which has been the
instrument of it. In addition to these persuasive
considerations, it may be observed, that the same reasons which
show the necessity of denying to the States the power of
regulating coin, prove with equal force that they ought not to be
at liberty to substitute a paper medium in the place of coin. Had
every State a right to regulate the value of its coin, there
might be as many different currencies as States, and thus the
intercourse among them would be impeded; retrospective
alterations in its value might be made, and thus the citizens of
other States be injured, and animosities be kindled among the
States themselves. The subjects of foreign powers might suffer
from the same cause, and hence the Union be discredited and
embroiled by the indiscretion of a single member. No one of these
mischiefs is less incident to a power in the States to emit paper
money, than to coin gold or silver. The power to make any thing
but gold and silver a tender in payment of debts, is withdrawn
from the States, on the same principle with that of issuing a
paper currency. Bills of attainder, ex-post-facto laws, and laws
impairing the obligation of contracts, are contrary to the first
principles of the social compact, and to every principle of sound
legislation. The two former are expressly prohibited by the
declarations prefixed to some of the State constitutions, and all
of them are prohibited by the spirit and scope of these
fundamental charters. Our own experience has taught us,
nevertheless, that additional fences against these dangers ought
not to be omitted. Very properly, therefore, have the convention
added this constitutional bulwark in favor of personal security
and private rights; and I am much deceived if they have not, in
so doing, as faithfully consulted the genuine sentiments as the
undoubted interests of their constituents. The sober people of
America are weary of the fluctuating policy which has directed
the public councils. They have seen with regret and indignation
that sudden changes and legislative interferences, in cases
affecting personal rights, become jobs in the hands of
enterprising and influential speculators, and snares to the
more-industrious and lessinformed part of the community. They
have seen, too, that one legislative interference is but the
first link of a long chain of repetitions, every subsequent
interference being naturally produced by the effects of the
preceding. They very rightly infer, therefore, that some thorough
reform is wanting, which will banish speculations on public
measures, inspire a general prudence and industry, and give a
regular course to the business of society. The prohibition with
respect to titles of nobility is copied from the articles of
Confederation and needs no comment. 2. ``No State shall, without
the consent of the Congress, lay any imposts or duties on imports
or exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing
its inspection laws, and the net produce of all duties and
imposts laid by any State on imports or exports, shall be for the
use of the treasury of the United States; and all such laws shall
be subject to the revision and control of the Congress. No State
shall, without the consent of Congress, lay any duty on tonnage,
keep troops or ships of war in time of peace, enter into any
agreement or compact with another State, or with a foreign power,
or engage in war unless actually invaded, or in such imminent
danger as will not admit of delay. ''The restraint on the power
of the States over imports and exports is enforced by all the
arguments which prove the necessity of submitting the regulation
of trade to the federal councils. It is needless, therefore, to
remark further on this head, than that the manner in which the
restraint is qualified seems well calculated at once to secure to
the States a reasonable discretion in providing for the
conveniency of their imports and exports, and to the United
States a reasonable check against the abuse of this discretion.
The remaining particulars of this clause fall within reasonings
which are either so obvious, or have been so fully developed,
that they may be passed over without remark. The SIXTH and last
class consists of the several powers and provisions by which
efficacy is given to all the rest. 1. Of these the first is, the
``power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for
carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other
powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the
United States, or in any department or officer thereof. ''Few
parts of the Constitution have been assailed with more
intemperance than this; yet on a fair investigation of it, no
part can appear more completely invulnerable. Without the
SUBSTANCE of this power, the whole Constitution would be a dead
letter. Those who object to the article, therefore, as a part of
the Constitution, can only mean that the FORM of the provision is
improper. But have they considered whether a better form could
have been substituted? There are four other possible methods
which the Constitution might have taken on this subject. They
might have copied the second article of the existing
Confederation, which would have prohibited the exercise of any
power not EXPRESSLY delegated; they might have attempted a
positive enumeration of the powers comprehended under the general
terms ``necessary and proper''; they might have attempted a
negative enumeration of them, by specifying the powers excepted
from the general definition; they might have been altogether
silent on the subject, leaving these necessary and proper powers
to construction and inference. Had the convention taken the
first method of adopting the second article of Confederation, it
is evident that the new Congress would be continually exposed, as
their predecessors have been, to the alternative of construing
the term ``EXPRESSLY'' with so much rigor, as to disarm the
government of all real authority whatever, or with so much
latitude as to destroy altogether the force of the restriction.
It would be easy to show, if it were necessary, that no important
power, delegated by the articles of Confederation, has been or
can be executed by Congress, without recurring more or less to
the doctrine of CONSTRUCTION or IMPLICATION. As the powers
delegated under the new system are more extensive, the government
which is to administer it would find itself still more distressed
with the alternative of betraying the public interests by doing
nothing, or of violating the Constitution by exercising powers
indispensably necessary and proper, but, at the same time, not
EXPRESSLY granted. Had the convention attempted a positive
enumeration of the powers necessary and proper for carrying their
other powers into effect, the attempt would have involved a
complete digest of laws on every subject to which the
Constitution relates; accommodated too, not only to the existing
state of things, but to all the possible changes which futurity
may produce; for in every new application of a general power, the
PARTICULAR POWERS, which are the means of attaining the OBJECT of
the general power, must always necessarily vary with that object,
and be often properly varied whilst the object remains the same.
Had they attempted to enumerate the particular powers or means
not necessary or proper for carrying the general powers into
execution, the task would have been no less chimerical; and would
have been liable to this further objection, that every defect in
the enumeration would have been equivalent to a positive grant of
authority. If, to avoid this consequence, they had attempted a
partial enumeration of the exceptions, and described the residue
by the general terms, NOT NECESSARY OR PROPER, it must have
happened that the enumeration would comprehend a few of the
excepted powers only; that these would be such as would be least
likely to be assumed or tolerated, because the enumeration would
of course select such as would be least necessary or proper; and
that the unnecessary and improper powers included in the
residuum, would be less forcibly excepted, than if no partial
enumeration had been made. Had the Constitution been silent on
this head, there can be no doubt that all the particular powers
requisite as means of executing the general powers would have
resulted to the government, by unavoidable implication. No axiom
is more clearly established in law, or in reason, than that
wherever the end is required, the means are authorized; wherever
a general power to do a thing is given, every particular power
necessary for doing it is included. Had this last method,
therefore, been pursued by the convention, every objection now
urged against their plan would remain in all its plausibility;
and the real inconveniency would be incurred of not removing a
pretext which may be seized on critical occasions for drawing
into question the essential powers of the Union. If it be asked
what is to be the consequence, in case the Congress shall
misconstrue this part of the Constitution, and exercise powers
not warranted by its true meaning, I answer, the same as if they
should misconstrue or enlarge any other power vested in them; as
if the general power had been reduced to particulars, and any one
of these were to be violated; the same, in short, as if the State
legislatures should violate the irrespective constitutional
authorities. In the first instance, the success of the usurpation
will depend on the executive and judiciary departments, which are
to expound and give effect to the legislative acts; and in the
last resort a remedy must be obtained from the people who can, by
the election of more faithful representatives, annul the acts of
the usurpers. The truth is, that this ultimate redress may be
more confided in against unconstitutional acts of the federal
than of the State legislatures, for this plain reason, that as
every such act of the former will be an invasion of the rights of
the latter, these will be ever ready to mark the innovation, to
sound the alarm to the people, and to exert their local influence
in effecting a change of federal representatives. There being no
such intermediate body between the State legislatures and the
people interested in watching the conduct of the former,
violations of the State constitutions are more likely to remain
unnoticed and unredressed. 2. ``This Constitution and the laws
of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof,
and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the
authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the
land, and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any
thing in the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary
notwithstanding. ''The indiscreet zeal of the adversaries to the
Constitution has betrayed them into an attack on this part of it
also, without which it would have been evidently and radically
defective. To be fully sensible of this, we need only suppose for
a moment that the supremacy of the State constitutions had been
left complete by a saving clause in their favor. In the first
place, as these constitutions invest the State legislatures with
absolute sovereignty, in all cases not excepted by the existing
articles of Confederation, all the authorities contained in the
proposed Constitution, so far as they exceed those enumerated in
the Confederation, would have been annulled, and the new Congress
would have been reduced to the same impotent condition with their
predecessors. In the next place, as the constitutions of some of
the States do not even expressly and fully recognize the existing
powers of the Confederacy, an express saving of the supremacy of
the former would, in such States, have brought into question
every power contained in the proposed Constitution. In the third
place, as the constitutions of the States differ much from each
other, it might happen that a treaty or national law, of great
and equal importance to the States, would interfere with some and
not with other constitutions, and would consequently be valid in
some of the States, at the same time that it would have no effect
in others. In fine, the world would have seen, for the first
time, a system of government founded on an inversion of the
fundamental principles of all government; it would have seen the
authority of the whole society every where subordinate to the
authority of the parts; it would have seen a monster, in which
the head was under the direction of the members. 3. ``The
Senators and Representatives, and the members of the several
State legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers, both
of the United States and the several States, shall be bound by
oath or affirmation to support this Constitution. ''It has been
asked why it was thought necessary, that the State magistracy
should be bound to support the federal Constitution, and
unnecessary that a like oath should be imposed on the officers of
the United States, in favor of the State constitutions. Several
reasons might be assigned for the distinction. I content myself
with one, which is obvious and conclusive. The members of the
federal government will have no agency in carrying the State
constitutions into effect. The members and officers of the State
governments, on the contrary, will have an essential agency in
giving effect to the federal Constitution. The election of the
President and Senate will depend, in all cases, on the
legislatures of the several States. And the election of the House
of Representatives will equally depend on the same authority in
the first instance; and will, probably, forever be conducted by
the officers, and according to the laws, of the States. 4. Among
the provisions for giving efficacy to the federal powers might be
added those which belong to the executive and judiciary
departments: but as these are reserved for particular examination
in another place, I pass them over in this. We have now
reviewed, in detail, all the articles composing the sum or
quantity of power delegated by the proposed Constitution to the
federal government, and are brought to this undeniable
conclusion, that no part of the power is unnecessary or improper
for accomplishing the necessary objects of the Union. The
question, therefore, whether this amount of power shall be
granted or not, resolves itself into another question, whether or
not a government commensurate to the exigencies of the Union
shall be established; or, in other words, whether the Union
itself shall be preserved. PUBLIUS. 


FEDERALIST No. 45

The Alleged Danger From the Powers of the Union to the State
Governments Considered
For the Independent Fournal. 

MADISON

To the People of the State of New York:
HAVING shown that no one of the powers transferred to the federal
government is unnecessary or improper, the next question to be
considered is, whether the whole mass of them will be dangerous
to the portion of authority left in the several States. The
adversaries to the plan of the convention, instead of considering
in the first place what degree of power was absolutely necessary
for the purposes of the federal government, have exhausted
themselves in a secondary inquiry into the possible consequences
of the proposed degree of power to the governments of the
particular States. But if the Union, as has been shown, be
essential to the security of the people of America against
foreign danger; if it be essential to their security against
contentions and wars among the different States; if it be
essential to guard them against those violent and oppressive
factions which embitter the blessings of liberty, and against
those military establishments which must gradually poison its
very fountain; if, in a word, the Union be essential to the
happiness of the people of America, is it not preposterous, to
urge as an objection to a government, without which the objects
of the Union cannot be attained, that such a government may
derogate from the importance of the governments of the individual
States? Was, then, the American Revolution effected, was the
American Confederacy formed, was the precious blood of thousands
spilt, and the hard-earned substance of millions lavished, not
that the people of America should enjoy peace, liberty, and
safety, but that the government of the individual States, that
particular municipal establishments, might enjoy a certain extent
of power, and be arrayed with certain dignities and attributes of
sovereignty? We have heard of the impious doctrine in the Old
World, that the people were made for kings, not kings for the
people. Is the same doctrine to be revived in the New, in another
shape that the solid happiness of the people is to be sacrificed
to the views of political institutions of a different form? It is
too early for politicians to presume on our forgetting that the
public good, the real welfare of the great body of the people, is
the supreme object to be pursued; and that no form of government
whatever has any other value than as it may be fitted for the
attainment of this object. Were the plan of the convention
adverse to the public happiness, my voice would be, Reject the
plan. Were the Union itself inconsistent with the public
happiness, it would be, Abolish the Union. In like manner, as far
as the sovereignty of the States cannot be reconciled to the
happiness of the people, the voice of every good citizen must be,
Let the former be sacrificed to the latter. How far the sacrifice
is necessary, has been shown. How far the unsacrificed residue
will be endangered, is the question before us. Several important
considerations have been touched in the course of these papers,
which discountenance the supposition that the operation of the
federal government will by degrees prove fatal to the State
governments. The more I revolve the subject, the more fully I am
persuaded that the balance is much more likely to be disturbed by
the preponderancy of the last than of the first scale. We have
seen, in all the examples of ancient and modern confederacies,
the strongest tendency continually betraying itself in the
members, to despoil the general government of its authorities,
with a very ineffectual capacity in the latter to defend itself
against the encroachments. Although, in most of these examples,
the system has been so dissimilar from that under consideration
as greatly to weaken any inference concerning the latter from the
fate of the former, yet, as the States will retain, under the
proposed Constitution, a very extensive portion of active
sovereignty, the inference ought not to be wholly disregarded. In
the Achaean league it is probable that the federal head had a
degree and species of power, which gave it a considerable
likeness to the government framed by the convention. The Lycian
Confederacy, as far as its principles and form are transmitted,
must have borne a still greater analogy to it. Yet history does
not inform us that either of them ever degenerated, or tended to
degenerate, into one consolidated government. On the contrary, we
know that the ruin of one of them proceeded from the incapacity
of the federal authority to prevent the dissensions, and finally
the disunion, of the subordinate authorities. These cases are the
more worthy of our attention, as the external causes by which the
component parts were pressed together were much more numerous and
powerful than in our case; and consequently less powerful
ligaments within would be sufficient to bind the members to the
head, and to each other. In the feudal system, we have seen a
similar propensity exemplified. Notwithstanding the want of
proper sympathy in every instance between the local sovereigns
and the people, and the sympathy in some instances between the
general sovereign and the latter, it usually happened that the
local sovereigns prevailed in the rivalship for encroachments.
Had no external dangers enforced internal harmony and
subordination, and particularly, had the local sovereigns
possessed the affections of the people, the great kingdoms in
Europe would at this time consist of as many independent princes
as there were formerly feudatory barons. The State government
will have the advantage of the Federal government, whether we
compare them in respect to the immediate dependence of the one on
the other; to the weight of personal influence which each side
will possess; to the powers respectively vested in them; to the
predilection and probable support of the people; to the
disposition and faculty of resisting and frustrating the measures
of each other. The State governments may be regarded as
constituent and essential parts of the federal government; whilst
the latter is nowise essential to the operation or organization
of the former. Without the intervention of the State
legislatures, the President of the United States cannot be
elected at all. They must in all cases have a great share in his
appointment, and will, perhaps, in most cases, of themselves
determine it. The Senate will be elected absolutely and
exclusively by the State legislatures. Even the House of
Representatives, though drawn immediately from the people, will
be chosen very much under the influence of that class of men,
whose influence over the people obtains for themselves an
election into the State legislatures. Thus, each of the principal
branches of the federal government will owe its existence more or
less to the favor of the State governments, and must consequently
feel a dependence, which is much more likely to beget a
disposition too obsequious than too overbearing towards them. On
the other side, the component parts of the State governments will
in no instance be indebted for their appointment to the direct
agency of the federal government, and very little, if at all, to
the local influence of its members. The number of individuals
employed under the Constitution of the United States will be much
smaller than the number employed under the particular States.
There will consequently be less of personal influence on the side
of the former than of the latter. The members of the legislative,
executive, and judiciary departments of thirteen and more States,
the justices of peace, officers of militia, ministerial officers
of justice, with all the county, corporation, and town officers,
for three millions and more of people, intermixed, and having
particular acquaintance with every class and circle of people,
must exceed, beyond all proportion, both in number and influence,
those of every description who will be employed in the
administration of the federal system. Compare the members of the
three great departments of the thirteen States, excluding from
the judiciary department the justices of peace, with the members
of the corresponding departments of the single government of the
Union; compare the militia officers of three millions of people
with the military and marine officers of any establishment which
is within the compass of probability, or, I may add, of
possibility, and in this view alone, we may pronounce the
advantage of the States to be decisive. If the federal government
is to have collectors of revenue, the State governments will have
theirs also. And as those of the former will be principally on
the seacoast, and not very numerous, whilst those of the latter
will be spread over the face of the country, and will be very
numerous, the advantage in this view also lies on the same side.
It is true, that the Confederacy is to possess, and may exercise,
the power of collecting internal as well as external taxes
throughout the States; but it is probable that this power will
not be resorted to, except for supplemental purposes of revenue;
that an option will then be given to the States to supply their
quotas by previous collections of their own; and that the
eventual collection, under the immediate authority of the Union,
will generally be made by the officers, and according to the
rules, appointed by the several States. Indeed it is extremely
probable, that in other instances, particularly in the
organization of the judicial power, the officers of the States
will be clothed with the correspondent authority of the Union.
Should it happen, however, that separate collectors of internal
revenue should be appointed under the federal government, the
influence of the whole number would not bear a comparison with
that of the multitude of State officers in the opposite scale.
Within every district to which a federal collector would be
allotted, there would not be less than thirty or forty, or even
more, officers of different descriptions, and many of them
persons of character and weight, whose influence would lie on the
side of the State. The powers delegated by the proposed
Constitution to the federal government are few and defined. Those
which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and
indefinite. The former will be exercised principally on external
objects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce; with
which last the power of taxation will, for the most part, be
connected. The powers reserved to the several States will extend
to all the objects which, in the ordinary course of affairs,
concern the lives, liberties, and properties of the people, and
the internal order, improvement, and prosperity of the State. The
operations of the federal government will be most extensive and
important in times of war and danger; those of the State
governments, in times of peace and security. As the former
periods will probably bear a small proportion to the latter, the
State governments will here enjoy another advantage over the
federal government. The more adequate, indeed, the federal powers
may be rendered to the national defense, the less frequent will
be those scenes of danger which might favor their ascendancy over
the governments of the particular States. If the new Constitution
be examined with accuracy and candor, it will be found that the
change which it proposes consists much less in the addition of
NEW POWERS to the Union, than in the invigoration of its ORIGINAL
POWERS. The regulation of commerce, it is true, is a new power;
but that seems to be an addition which few oppose, and from which
no apprehensions are entertained. The powers relating to war and
peace, armies and fleets, treaties and finance, with the other
more considerable powers, are all vested in the existing Congress
by the articles of Confederation. The proposed change does not
enlarge these powers; it only substitutes a more effectual mode
of administering them. The change relating to taxation may be
regarded as the most important; and yet the present Congress have
as complete authority to REQUIRE of the States indefinite
supplies of money for the common defense and general welfare, as
the future Congress will have to require them of individual
citizens; and the latter will be no more bound than the States
themselves have been, to pay the quotas respectively taxed on
them. Had the States complied punctually with the articles of
Confederation, or could their compliance have been enforced by as
peaceable means as may be used with success towards single
persons, our past experience is very far from countenancing an
opinion, that the State governments would have lost their
constitutional powers, and have gradually undergone an entire
consolidation. To maintain that such an event would have ensued,
would be to say at once, that the existence of the State
governments is incompatible with any system whatever that
accomplishes the essental purposes of the Union. PUBLIUS. 


FEDERALIST No. 46

The Influence of the State and Federal Governments Compared
From the New York Packet. Tuesday, January 29, 1788. 

MADISON

To the People of the State of New York:
RESUMING the subject of the last paper, I proceed to inquire
whether the federal government or the State governments will have
the advantage with regard to the predilection and support of the
people. Notwithstanding the different modes in which they are
appointed, we must consider both of them as substantially
dependent on the great body of the citizens of the United States.
I assume this position here as it respects the first, reserving
the proofs for another place. The federal and State governments
are in fact but different agents and trustees of the people,
constituted with different powers, and designed for different
purposes. The adversaries of the Constitution seem to have lost
sight of the people altogether in their reasonings on this
subject; and to have viewed these different establishments, not
only as mutual rivals and enemies, but as uncontrolled by any
common superior in their efforts to usurp the authorities of each
other. These gentlemen must here be reminded of their error. They
must be told that the ultimate authority, wherever the derivative
may be found, resides in the people alone, and that it will not
depend merely on the comparative ambition or address of the
different governments, whether either, or which of them, will be
able to enlarge its sphere of jurisdiction at the expense of the
other. Truth, no less than decency, requires that the event in
every case should be supposed to depend on the sentiments and
sanction of their common constituents. Many considerations,
besides those suggested on a former occasion, seem to place it
beyond doubt that the first and most natural attachment of the
people will be to the governments of their respective States.
Into the administration of these a greater number of individuals
will expect to rise. From the gift of these a greater number of
offices and emoluments will flow. By the superintending care of
these, all the more domestic and personal interests of the people
will be regulated and provided for. With the affairs of these,
the people will be more familiarly and minutely conversant. And
with the members of these, will a greater proportion of the
people have the ties of personal acquaintance and friendship, and
of family and party attachments; on the side of these,
therefore, the popular bias may well be expected most strongly to
incline. Experience speaks the same language in this case. The
federal administration, though hitherto very defective in
comparison with what may be hoped under a better system, had,
during the war, and particularly whilst the independent fund of
paper emissions was in credit, an activity and importance as
great as it can well have in any future circumstances whatever.
It was engaged, too, in a course of measures which had for their
object the protection of everything that was dear, and the
acquisition of everything that could be desirable to the people
at large. It was, nevertheless, invariably found, after the
transient enthusiasm for the early Congresses was over, that the
attention and attachment of the people were turned anew to their
own particular governments; that the federal council was at no
time the idol of popular favor; and that opposition to proposed
enlargements of its powers and importance was the side usually
taken by the men who wished to build their political consequence
on the prepossessions of their fellow-citizens. If, therefore,
as has been elsewhere remarked, the people should in future
become more partial to the federal than to the State governments,
the change can only result from such manifest and irresistible
proofs of a better administration, as will overcome all their
antecedent propensities. And in that case, the people ought not
surely to be precluded from giving most of their confidence where
they may discover it to be most due; but even in that case the
State governments could have little to apprehend, because it is
only within a certain sphere that the federal power can, in the
nature of things, be advantageously administered. The remaining
points on which I propose to compare the federal and State
governments, are the disposition and the faculty they may
respectively possess, to resist and frustrate the measures of
each other. It has been already proved that the members of the
federal will be more dependent on the members of the State
governments, than the latter will be on the former. It has
appeared also, that the prepossessions of the people, on whom
both will depend, will be more on the side of the State
governments, than of the federal government. So far as the
disposition of each towards the other may be influenced by these
causes, the State governments must clearly have the advantage.
But in a distinct and very important point of view, the advantage
will lie on the same side. The prepossessions, which the members
themselves will carry into the federal government, will generally
be favorable to the States; whilst it will rarely happen, that
the members of the State governments will carry into the public
councils a bias in favor of the general government. A local
spirit will infallibly prevail much more in the members of
Congress, than a national spirit will prevail in the legislatures
of the particular States. Every one knows that a great proportion
of the errors committed by the State legislatures proceeds from
the disposition of the members to sacrifice the comprehensive and
permanent interest of the State, to the particular and separate
views of the counties or districts in which they reside. And if
they do not sufficiently enlarge their policy to embrace the
collective welfare of their particular State, how can it be
imagined that they will make the aggregate prosperity of the
Union, and the dignity and respectability of its government, the
objects of their affections and consultations? For the same
reason that the members of the State legislatures will be
unlikely to attach themselves sufficiently to national objects,
the members of the federal legislature will be likely to attach
themselves too much to local objects. The States will be to the
latter what counties and towns are to the former. Measures will
too often be decided according to their probable effect, not on
the national prosperity and happiness, but on the prejudices,
interests, and pursuits of the governments and people of the
individual States. What is the spirit that has in general
characterized the proceedings of Congress? A perusal of their
journals, as well as the candid acknowledgments of such as have
had a seat in that assembly, will inform us, that the members
have but too frequently displayed the character, rather of
partisans of their respective States, than of impartial guardians
of a common interest; that where on one occasion improper
sacrifices have been made of local considerations, to the
aggrandizement of the federal government, the great interests of
the nation have suffered on a hundred, from an undue attention to
the local prejudices, interests, and views of the particular
States. I mean not by these reflections to insinuate, that the
new federal government will not embrace a more enlarged plan of
policy than the existing government may have pursued; much less,
that its views will be as confined as those of the State
legislatures; but only that it will partake sufficiently of the
spirit of both, to be disinclined to invade the rights of the
individual States, or the preorgatives of their governments. The
motives on the part of the State governments, to augment their
prerogatives by defalcations from the federal government, will be
overruled by no reciprocal predispositions in the members. Were
it admitted, however, that the Federal government may feel an
equal disposition with the State governments to extend its power
beyond the due limits, the latter would still have the advantage
in the means of defeating such encroachments. If an act of a
particular State, though unfriendly to the national government,
be generally popular in that State and should not too grossly
violate the oaths of the State officers, it is executed
immediately and, of course, by means on the spot and depending on
the State alone. The opposition of the federal government, or the
interposition of federal officers, would but inflame the zeal of
all parties on the side of the State, and the evil could not be
prevented or repaired, if at all, without the employment of means
which must always be resorted to with reluctance and difficulty.
On the other hand, should an unwarrantable measure of the federal
government be unpopular in particular States, which would seldom
fail to be the case, or even a warrantable measure be so, which
may sometimes be the case, the means of opposition to it are
powerful and at hand. The disquietude of the people; their
repugnance and, perhaps, refusal to co-operate with the officers
of the Union; the frowns of the executive magistracy of the
State; the embarrassments created by legislative devices, which
would often be added on such occasions, would oppose, in any
State, difficulties not to be despised; would form, in a large
State, very serious impediments; and where the sentiments of
several adjoining States happened to be in unison, would present
obstructions which the federal government would hardly be willing
to encounter. But ambitious encroachments of the federal
government, on the authority of the State governments, would not
excite the opposition of a single State, or of a few States
only. They would be signals of general alarm. Every government
would espouse the common cause. A correspondence would be
opened. Plans of resistance would be concerted. One spirit would
animate and conduct the whole. The same combinations, in short,
would result from an apprehension of the federal, as was produced
by the dread of a foreign, yoke; and unless the projected
innovations should be voluntarily renounced, the same appeal to
a trial of force would be made in the one case as was made in the
other. But what degree of madness could ever drive the federal
government to such an extremity. In the contest with Great
Britain, one part of the empire was employed against the other.
The more numerous part invaded the rights of the less numerous
part. The attempt was unjust and unwise; but it was not in
speculation absolutely chimerical. But what would be the contest
in the case we are supposing? Who would be the parties? A few
representatives of the people would be opposed to the people
themselves; or rather one set of representatives would be
contending against thirteen sets of representatives, with the
whole body of their common constituents on the side of the
latter. The only refuge left for those who prophesy the downfall
of the State governments is the visionary supposition that the
federal government may previously accumulate a military force for
the projects of ambition. The reasonings contained in these
papers must have been employed to little purpose indeed, if it
could be necessary now to disprove the reality of this danger.
That the people and the States should, for a sufficient period of
time, elect an uninterupted succession of men ready to betray
both; that the traitors should, throughout this period,
uniformly and systematically pursue some fixed plan for the
extension of the military establishment; that the governments
and the people of the States should silently and patiently behold
the gathering storm, and continue to supply the materials, until
it should be prepared to burst on their own heads, must appear to
every one more like the incoherent dreams of a delirious
jealousy, or the misjudged exaggerations of a counterfeit zeal,
than like the sober apprehensions of genuine patriotism.
Extravagant as the supposition is, let it however be made. Let a
regular army, fully equal to the resources of the country, be
formed; and let it be entirely at the devotion of the federal
government; still it would not be going too far to say, that the
State governments, with the people on their side, would be able
to repel the danger. The highest number to which, according to
the best computation, a standing army can be carried in any
country, does not exceed one hundredth part of the whole number
of souls; or one twenty-fifth part of the number able to bear
arms. This proportion would not yield, in the United States, an
army of more than twenty-five or thirty thousand men. To these
would be opposed a militia amounting to near half a million of
citizens with arms in their hands, officered by men chosen from
among themselves, fighting for their common liberties, and united
and conducted by governments possessing their affections and
confidence. It may well be doubted, whether a militia thus
circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of
regular troops. Those who are best acquainted with the last
successful resistance of this country against the British arms,
will be most inclined to deny the possibility of it. Besides the
advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the
people of almost every other nation, the existence of
subordinate governments, to which the people are attached, and by
which the militia officers are appointed, forms a barrier against
the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a
simple government of any form can admit of. Notwithstanding the
military establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which
are carried as far as the public resources will bear, the
governments are afraid to trust the people with arms. And it is
not certain, that with this aid alone they would not be able to
shake off their yokes. But were the people to possess the
additional advantages of local governments chosen by themselves,
who could collect the national will and direct the national
force, and of officers appointed out of the militia, by these
governments, and attached both to them and to the militia, it may
be affirmed with the greatest assurance, that the throne of every
tyranny in Europe would be speedily overturned in spite of the
legions which surround it. Let us not insult the free and gallant
citizens of America with the suspicion, that they would be less
able to defend the rights of which they would be in actual
possession, than the debased subjects of arbitrary power would be
to rescue theirs from the hands of their oppressors. Let us
rather no longer insult them with the supposition that they can
ever reduce themselves to the necessity of making the experiment,
by a blind and tame submission to the long train of insidious
measures which must precede and produce it. The argument under
the present head may be put into a very concise form, which
appears altogether conclusive. Either the mode in which the
federal government is to be constructed will render it
sufficiently dependent on the people, or it will not. On the
first supposition, it will be restrained by that dependence from
forming schemes obnoxious to their constituents. On the other
supposition, it will not possess the confidence of the people,
and its schemes of usurpation will be easily defeated by the
State governments, who will be supported by the people. On
summing up the considerations stated in this and the last paper,
they seem to amount to the most convincing evidence, that the
powers proposed to be lodged in the federal government are as
little formidable to those reserved to the individual States, as
they are indispensably necessary to accomplish the purposes of
the Union; and that all those alarms which have been sounded, of
a meditated and consequential annihilation of the State
governments, must, on the most favorable interpretation, be
ascribed to the chimerical fears of the authors of them. PUBLIUS.


FEDERALIST No. 47

The Particular Structure of the New Government and the
Distribution of Power Among Its Different Parts
From the New York Packet. Friday, February 1, 1788. 

MADISON

To the People of the State of New York:
HAVING reviewed the general form of the proposed government and
the general mass of power allotted to it, I proceed to examine
the particular structure of this government, and the distribution
of this mass of power among its constituent parts. One of the
principal objections inculcated by the more respectable
adversaries to the Constitution, is its supposed violation of the
political maxim, that the legislative, executive, and judiciary
departments ought to be separate and distinct. In the structure
of the federal government, no regard, it is said, seems to have
been paid to this essential precaution in favor of liberty. The
several departments of power are distributed and blended in such
a manner as at once to destroy all symmetry and beauty of form,
and to expose some of the essential parts of the edifice to the
danger of being crushed by the disproportionate weight of other
parts. No political truth is certainly of greater intrinsic
value, or is stamped with the authority of more enlightened
patrons of liberty, than that on which the objection is founded.
The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and
judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and
whether hereditary, selfappointed, or elective, may justly be
pronounced the very definition of tyranny. Were the federal
Constitution, therefore, really chargeable with the accumulation
of power, or with a mixture of powers, having a dangerous
tendency to such an accumulation, no further arguments would be
necessary to inspire a universal reprobation of the system. I
persuade myself, however, that it will be made apparent to every
one, that the charge cannot be supported, and that the maxim on
which it relies has been totally misconceived and misapplied. In
order to form correct ideas on this important subject, it will be
proper to investigate the sense in which the preservation of
liberty requires that the three great departments of power should
be separate and distinct. The oracle who is always consulted and
cited on this subject is the celebrated Montesquieu. If he be not
the author of this invaluable precept in the science of politics,
he has the merit at least of displaying and recommending it most
effectually to the attention of mankind. Let us endeavor, in the
first place, to ascertain his meaning on this point. The British
Constitution was to Montesquieu what Homer has been to the
didactic writers on epic poetry. As the latter have considered
the work of the immortal bard as the perfect model from which the
principles and rules of the epic art were to be drawn, and by
which all similar works were to be judged, so this great
political critic appears to have viewed the Constitution of
England as the standard, or to use his own expression, as the
mirror of political liberty; and to have delivered, in the form
of elementary truths, the several characteristic principles of
that particular system. That we may be sure, then, not to mistake
his meaning in this case, let us recur to the source from which
the maxim was drawn.                                             
                         On the slightest view of the British
Constitution, we must perceive that the legislative, executive,
and judiciary departments are by no means totally separate and
distinct from each other. The executive magistrate forms an
integral part of the legislative authority. He alone has the
prerogative of making treaties with foreign sovereigns, which,
when made, have, under certain limitations, the force of
legislative acts. All the members of the judiciary department are
appointed by him, can be removed by him on the address of the two
Houses of Parliament, and form, when he pleases to consult them,
one of his constitutional councils. One branch of the legislative
department forms also a great constitutional council to the
executive chief, as, on another hand, it is the sole depositary
of judicial power in cases of impeachment, and is invested with
the supreme appellate jurisdiction in all other cases. The
judges, again, are so far connected with the legislative
department as often to attend and participate in its
deliberations, though not admitted to a legislative vote. From
these facts, by which Montesquieu was guided, it may clearly be
inferred that, in saying ``There can be no liberty where the
legislative and executive powers are united in the same person,
or body of magistrates,'' or, ``if the power of judging be not
separated from the legislative and executive powers,'' he did not
mean that these departments ought to have no PARTIAL AGENCY in,
or no CONTROL over, the acts of each other. His meaning, as his
own words import, and still more conclusively as illustrated by
the example in his eye, can amount to no more than this, that
where the WHOLE power of one department is exercised by the same
hands which possess the WHOLE power of another department, the
fundamental principles of a free constitution are subverted. This
would have been the case in the constitution examined by him, if
the king, who is the sole executive magistrate, had possessed
also the complete legislative power, or the supreme
administration of justice; or if the entire legislative body had
possessed the supreme judiciary, or the supreme executive
authority. This, however, is not among the vices of that
constitution. The magistrate in whom the whole executive power
resides cannot of himself make a law, though he can put a
negative on every law; nor administer justice in person, though
he has the appointment of those who do administer it. The judges
can exercise no executive prerogative, though they are shoots
from the executive stock; nor any legislative function, though
they may be advised with by the legislative councils. The entire
legislature can perform no judiciary act, though by the joint act
of two of its branches the judges may be removed from their
offices, and though one of its branches is possessed of the
judicial power in the last resort. The entire legislature, again,
can exercise no executive prerogative, though one of its branches
constitutes the supreme executive magistracy, and another, on the
impeachment of a third, can try and condemn all the subordinate
officers in the executive department. The reasons on which
Montesquieu grounds his maxim are a further demonstration of his
meaning. ``When the legislative and executive powers are united
in the same person or body,'' says he, ``there can be no liberty,
because apprehensions may arise lest THE SAME monarch or senate
should ENACT tyrannical laws to EXECUTE them in a tyrannical
manner. '' Again: ``Were the power of judging joined with the
legislative, the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed
to arbitrary control, for THE JUDGE would then be THE LEGISLATOR.
Were it joined to the executive power, THE JUDGE might behave
with all the violence of AN OPPRESSOR. '' Some of these reasons
are more fully explained in other passages; but briefly stated as
they are here, they sufficiently establish the meaning which we
have put on this celebrated maxim of this celebrated author.     
                                                                
If we look into the constitutions of the several States, we find
that, notwithstanding the emphatical and, in some instances, the
unqualified terms in which this axiom has been laid down, there
is not a single instance in which the several departments of
power have been kept absolutely separate and distinct. New
Hampshire, whose constitution was the last formed, seems to have
been fully aware of the impossibility and inexpediency of
avoiding any mixture whatever of these departments, and has
qualified the doctrine by declaring ``that the legislative,
executive, and judiciary powers ought to be kept as separate
from, and independent of, each other AS THE NATURE OF A FREE
GOVERNMENT WILL ADMIT; OR AS IS CONSISTENT WITH THAT CHAIN OF
CONNECTION THAT BINDS THE WHOLE FABRIC OF THE CONSTITUTION IN ONE
INDISSOLUBLE BOND OF UNITY AND AMITY. '' Her constitution
accordingly mixes these departments in several respects. The
Senate, which is a branch of the legislative department, is also
a judicial tribunal for the trial of impeachments. The
President, who is the head of the executive department, is the
presiding member also of the Senate; and, besides an equal vote
in all cases, has a casting vote in case of a tie. The executive
head is himself eventually elective every year by the
legislative department, and his council is every year chosen by
and from the members of the same department. Several of the
officers of state are also appointed by the legislature. And the
members of the judiciary department are appointed by the
executive department. The constitution of Massachusetts has
observed a sufficient though less pointed caution, in expressing
this fundamental article of liberty. It declares ``that the
legislative department shall never exercise the executive and
judicial powers, or either of them; the executive shall never
exercise the legislative and judicial powers, or either of them;
the judicial shall never exercise the legislative and executive
powers, or either of them. '' This declaration corresponds
precisely with the doctrine of Montesquieu, as it has been
explained, and is not in a single point violated by the plan of
the convention. It goes no farther than to prohibit any one of
the entire departments from exercising the powers of another
department. In the very Constitution to which it is prefixed, a
partial mixture of powers has been admitted. The executive
magistrate has a qualified negative on the legislative body, and
the Senate, which is a part of the legislature, is a court of
impeachment for members both of the executive and judiciary
departments. The members of the judiciary department, again, are
appointable by the executive department, and removable by the
same authority on the address of the two legislative branches.
Lastly, a number of the officers of government are annually
appointed by the legislative department. As the appointment to
offices, particularly executive offices, is in its nature an
executive function, the compilers of the Constitution have, in
this last point at least, violated the rule established by
themselves. I pass over the constitutions of Rhode Island and
Connecticut, because they were formed prior to the Revolution,
and even before the principle under examination had become an
object of political attention. The constitution of New York
contains no declaration on this subject; but appears very
clearly to have been framed with an eye to the danger of
improperly blending the different departments. It gives,
nevertheless, to the executive magistrate, a partial control over
the legislative department; and, what is more, gives a like
control to the judiciary department; and even blends the
executive and judiciary departments in the exercise of this
control. In its council of appointment members of the
legislative are associated with the executive authority, in the
appointment of officers, both executive and judiciary. And its
court for the trial of impeachments and correction of errors is
to consist of one branch of the legislature and the principal
members of the judiciary department. The constitution of New
Jersey has blended the different powers of government more than
any of the preceding. The governor, who is the executive
magistrate, is appointed by the legislature; is chancellor and
ordinary, or surrogate of the State; is a member of the Supreme
Court of Appeals, and president, with a casting vote, of one of
the legislative branches. The same legislative branch acts again
as executive council of the governor, and with him constitutes
the Court of Appeals. The members of the judiciary department are
appointed by the legislative department and removable by one
branch of it, on the impeachment of the other. According to the
constitution of Pennsylvania, the president, who is the head of
the executive department, is annually elected by a vote in which
the legislative department predominates. In conjunction with an
executive council, he appoints the members of the judiciary
department, and forms a court of impeachment for trial of all
officers, judiciary as well as executive. The judges of the
Supreme Court and justices of the peace seem also to be removable
by the legislature; and the executive power of pardoning in
certain cases, to be referred to the same department. The members
of the executive counoil are made EX-OFFICIO justices of peace
throughout the State. In Delaware, the chief executive magistrate
is annually elected by the legislative department. The speakers
of the two legislative branches are vice-presidents in the
executive department. The executive chief, with six others,
appointed, three by each of the legislative branches constitutes
the Supreme Court of Appeals; he is joined with the legislative
department in the appointment of the other judges. Throughout the
States, it appears that the members of the legislature may at the
same time be justices of the peace; in this State, the members of
one branch of it are EX-OFFICIO justices of the peace; as are
also the members of the executive council. The principal officers
of the executive department are appointed by the legislative; and
one branch of the latter forms a court of impeachments. All
officers may be removed on address of the legislature. Maryland
has adopted the maxim in the most unqualified terms; declaring
that the legislative, executive, and judicial powers of
government ought to be forever separate and distinct from each
other. Her constitution, notwithstanding, makes the executive
magistrate appointable by the legislative department; and the
members of the judiciary by the executive department. The
language of Virginia is still more pointed on this subject. Her
constitution declares, ``that the legislative, executive, and
judiciary departments shall be separate and distinct; so that
neither exercise the powers properly belonging to the other; nor
shall any person exercise the powers of more than one of them at
the same time, except that the justices of county courts shall be
eligible to either House of Assembly. '' Yet we find not only
this express exception, with respect to the members of the
irferior courts, but that the chief magistrate, with his
executive council, are appointable by the legislature; that two
members of the latter are triennially displaced at the pleasure
of the legislature; and that all the principal offices, both
executive and judiciary, are filled by the same department. The
executive prerogative of pardon, also, is in one case vested in
the legislative department. The constitution of North Carolina,
which declares ``that the legislative, executive, and supreme
judicial powers of government ought to be forever separate and
distinct from each other,'' refers, at the same time, to the
legislative department, the appointment not only of the executive
chief, but all the principal officers within both that and the
judiciary department. In South Carolina, the constitution makes
the executive magistracy eligible by the legislative department.
It gives to the latter, also, the appointment of the members of
the judiciary department, including even justices of the peace
and sheriffs; and the appointment of officers in the executive
department, down to captains in the army and navy of the State.
In the constitution of Georgia, where it is declared ``that the
legislative, executive, and judiciary departments shall be
separate and distinct, so that neither exercise the powers
properly belonging to the other,'' we find that the executive
department is to be filled by appointments of the legislature;
and the executive prerogative of pardon to be finally exercised
by the same authority. Even justices of the peace are to be
appointed by the legislature. In citing these cases, in which
the legislative, executive, and judiciary departments have not
been kept totally separate and distinct, I wish not to be
regarded as an advocate for the particular organizations of the
several State governments. I am fully aware that among the many
excellent principles which they exemplify, they carry strong
marks of the haste, and still stronger of the inexperience, under
which they were framed. It is but too obvious that in some
instances the fundamental principle under consideration has been
violated by too great a mixture, and even an actual
consolidation, of the different powers; and that in no instance
has a competent provision been made for maintaining in practice
the separation delineated on paper. What I have wished to evince
is, that the charge brought against the proposed Constitution, of
violating the sacred maxim of free government, is warranted
neither by the real meaning annexed to that maxim by its author,
nor by the sense in which it has hitherto been understood in
America. This interesting subject will be resumed in the ensuing
paper. PUBLIUS. 


FEDERALIST No. 48

These Departments Should Not Be So Far Separated as to Have No
Constitutional Control Over Each Other
From the New York Packet. Friday, February 1, 1788. 

MADISON

To the People of the State of New York:
IT WAS shown in the last paper that the political apothegm there
examined does not require that the legislative, executive, and
judiciary departments should be wholly unconnected with each
other. I shall undertake, in the next place, to show that unless
these departments be so far connected and blended as to give to
each a constitutional control over the others, the degree of
separation which the maxim requires, as essential to a free
government, can never in practice be duly maintained. It is
agreed on all sides, that the powers properly belonging to one of
the departments ought not to be directly and completely
administered by either of the other departments. It is equally
evident, that none of them ought to possess, directly or
indirectly, an overruling influence over the others, in the
administration of their respective powers. It will not be denied,
that power is of an encroaching nature, and that it ought to be
effectually restrained from passing the limits assigned to it.
After discriminating, therefore, in theory, the several classes
of power, as they may in their nature be legislative, executive,
or judiciary, the next and most difficult task is to provide some
practical security for each, against the invasion of the others.
What this security ought to be, is the great problem to be
solved. Will it be sufficient to mark, with precision, the
boundaries of these departments, in the constitution of the
government, and to trust to these parchment barriers against the
encroaching spirit of power? This is the security which appears
to have been principally relied on by the compilers of most of
the American constitutions. But experience assures us, that the
efficacy of the provision has been greatly overrated; and that
some more adequate defense is indispensably necessary for the
more feeble, against the more powerful, members of the
government. The legislative department is everywhere extending
the sphere of its activity, and drawing all power into its
impetuous vortex. The founders of our republics have so much
merit for the wisdom which they have displayed, that no task can
be less pleasing than that of pointing out the errors into which
they have fallen. A respect for truth, however, obliges us to
remark, that they seem never for a moment to have turned their
eyes from the danger to liberty from the overgrown and
all-grasping prerogative of an hereditary magistrate, supported
and fortified by an hereditary branch of the legislative
authority. They seem never to have recollected the danger from
legislative usurpations, which, by assembling all power in the
same hands, must lead to the same tyranny as is threatened by
executive usurpations. In a government where numerous and
extensive prerogatives are placed in the hands of an hereditary
monarch, the executive department is very justly regarded as the
source of danger, and watched with all the jealousy which a zeal
for liberty ought to inspire. In a democracy, where a multitude
of people exercise in person the legislative functions, and are
continually exposed, by their incapacity for regular deliberation
and concerted measures, to the ambitious intrigues of their
executive magistrates, tyranny may well be apprehended, on some
favorable emergency, to start up in the same quarter. But in a
representative republic, where the executive magistracy is
carefully limited; both in the extent and the duration of its
power; and where the legislative power is exercised by an
assembly, which is inspired, by a supposed influence over the
people, with an intrepid confidence in its own strength; which is
sufficiently numerous to feel all the passions which actuate a
multitude, yet not so numerous as to be incapable of pursuing the
objects of its passions, by means which reason prescribes; it is
against the enterprising ambition of this department that the
people ought to indulge all their jealousy and exhaust all their
precautions. The legislative department derives a superiority in
our governments from other circumstances. Its constitutional
powers being at once more extensive, and less susceptible of
precise limits, it can, with the greater facility, mask, under
complicated and indirect measures, the encroachments which it
makes on the co-ordinate departments. It is not unfrequently a
question of real nicety in legislative bodies, whether the
operation of a particular measure will, or will not, extend
beyond the legislative sphere. On the other side, the executive
power being restrained within a narrower compass, and being more
simple in its nature, and the judiciary being described by
landmarks still less uncertain, projects of usurpation by either
of these departments would immediately betray and defeat
themselves. Nor is this all: as the legislative department alone
has access to the pockets of the people, and has in some
constitutions full discretion, and in all a prevailing influence,
over the pecuniary rewards of those who fill the other
departments, a dependence is thus created in the latter, which
gives still greater facility to encroachments of the former. I
have appealed to our own experience for the truth of what I
advance on this subject. Were it necessary to verify this
experience by particular proofs, they might be multiplied
without end. I might find a witness in every citizen who has
shared in, or been attentive to, the course of public
administrations. I might collect vouchers in abundance from the
records and archives of every State in the Union. But as a more
concise, and at the same time equally satisfactory, evidence, I
will refer to the example of two States, attested by two
unexceptionable authorities. The first example is that of
Virginia, a State which, as we have seen, has expressly declared
in its constitution, that the three great departments ought not
to be intermixed. The authority in support of it is Mr.
Jefferson, who, besides his other advantages for remarking the
operation of the government, was himself the chief magistrate of
it. In order to convey fully the ideas with which his experience
had impressed him on this subject, it will be necessary to quote
a passage of some length from his very interesting ``Notes on the
State of Virginia,'' p. 195. ``All the powers of government,
legislative, executive, and judiciary, result to the legislative
body. The concentrating these in the same hands, is precisely the
definition of despotic government. It will be no alleviation,
that these powers will be exercised by a plurality of hands, and
not by a single one. One hundred and seventy-three despots would
surely be as oppressive as one. Let those who doubt it, turn
their eyes on the republic of Venice. As little will it avail us,
that they are chosen by ourselves. An ELECTIVE DESPOTISM was not
the government we fought for; but one which should not only be
founded on free principles, but in which the powers of government
should be so divided and balanced among several bodies of
magistracy, as that no one could transcend their legal limits,
without being effectually checked and restrained by the others.
For this reason, that convention which passed the ordinance of
government, laid its foundation on this basis, that the
legislative, executive, and judiciary departments should be
separate and distinct, so that no person should exercise the
powers of more than one of them at the same time. BUT NO BARRIER
WAS PROVIDED BETWEEN THESE SEVERAL POWERS. The judiciary and the
executive members were left dependent on the legislative for
their subsistence in office, and some of them for their
continuance in it. If, therefore, the legislature assumes
executive and judiciary powers, no opposition is likely to be
made; nor, if made, can be effectual; because in that case they
may put their proceedings into the form of acts of Assembly,
which will render them obligatory on the other branches. They
have accordingly, IN MANY instances, DECIDED RIGHTS which should
have been left to JUDICIARY CONTROVERSY, and THE DIRECTION OF THE
EXECUTIVE, DURING THE WHOLE TIME OF THEIR SESSION, IS BECOMING
HABITUAL AND FAMILIAR. ''The other State which I shall take for
an example is Pennsylvania; and the other authority, the Council
of Censors, which assembled in the years 1783 and 1784. A part of
the duty of this body, as marked out by the constitution, was
``to inquire whether the constitution had been preserved
inviolate in every part; and whether the legislative and
executive branches of government had performed their duty as
guardians of the people, or assumed to themselves, or exercised,
other or greater powers than they are entitled to by the
constitution. '' In the execution of this trust, the council were
necessarily led to a comparison of both the legislative and
executive proceedings, with the constitutional powers of these
departments; and from the facts enumerated, and to the truth of
most of which both sides in the council subscribed, it appears
that the constitution had been flagrantly violated by the
legislature in a variety of important instances. A great number
of laws had been passed, violating, without any apparent
necessity, the rule requiring that all bills of a public nature
shall be previously printed for the consideration of the people;
although this is one of the precautions chiefly relied on by the
constitution against improper acts of legislature. The
constitutional trial by jury had been violated, and powers
assumed which had not been delegated by the constitution.
Executive powers had been usurped. The salaries of the judges,
which the constitution expressly requires to be fixed, had been
occasionally varied; and cases belonging to the judiciary
department frequently drawn within legislative cognizance and
determination. Those who wish to see the several particulars
falling under each of these heads, may consult the journals of
the council, which are in print. Some of them, it will be found,
may be imputable to peculiar circumstances connected with the
war; but the greater part of them may be considered as the
spontaneous shoots of an ill-constituted government. It appears,
also, that the executive department had not been innocent of
frequent breaches of the constitution. There are three
observations, however, which ought to be made on this head:
FIRST, a great proportion of the instances were either
immediately produced by the necessities of the war, or
recommended by Congress or the commander-in-chief; SECONDLY, in
most of the other instances, they conformed either to the
declared or the known sentiments of the legislative department;
THIRDLY, the executive department of Pennsylvania is
distinguished from that of the other States by the number of
members composing it. In this respect, it has as much affinity
to a legislative assembly as to an executive council. And being
at once exempt from the restraint of an individual responsibility
for the acts of the body, and deriving confidence from mutual
example and joint influence, unauthorized measures would, of
course, be more freely hazarded, than where the executive
department is administered by a single hand, or by a few hands.
The conclusion which I am warranted in drawing from these
observations is, that a mere demarcation on parchment of the
constitutional limits of the several departments, is not a
sufficient guard against those encroachments which lead to a
tyrannical concentration of all the powers of government in the

Method of Guarding Against the Encroachments of Any One
Department of Government by Appealing to the People Through a
Convention
From the New York Packet. Tuesday, February 5, 1788. 

HAMILTON OR MADISON

To the People of the State of New York:
THE author of the ``Notes on the State of Virginia,'' quoted in
the last paper, has subjoined to that valuable work the draught
of a constitution, which had been prepared in order to be laid
before a convention, expected to be called in 1783, by the
legislature, for the establishment of a constitution for that
commonwealth. The plan, like every thing from the same pen, marks
a turn of thinking, original, comprehensive, and accurate; and is
the more worthy of attention as it equally displays a fervent
attachment to republican government and an enlightened view of
the dangerous propensities against which it ought to be guarded.
One of the precautions which he proposes, and on which he appears
ultimately to rely as a palladium to the weaker departments of
power against the invasions of the stronger, is perhaps
altogether his own, and as it immediately relates to the subject
of our present inquiry, ought not to be overlooked. His
proposition is, ``that whenever any two of the three branches of
government shall concur in opinion, each by the voices of two
thirds of their whole number, that a convention is necessary for
altering the constitution, or CORRECTING BREACHES OF IT, a
convention shall be called for the purpose. ''As the people are
the only legitimate fountain of power, and it is from them that
the constitutional charter, under which the several branches of
government hold their power, is derived, it seems strictly
consonant to the republican theory, to recur to the same original
authority, not only whenever it may be necessary to enlarge,
diminish, or new-model the powers of the government, but also
whenever any one of the departments may commit encroachments on
the chartered authorities of the others. The several departments
being perfectly co-ordinate by the terms of their common
commission, none of them, it is evident, can pretend to an
exclusive or superior right of settling the boundaries between
their respective powers; and how are the encroachments of the
stronger to be prevented, or the wrongs of the weaker to be
redressed, without an appeal to the people themselves, who, as
the grantors of the commissions, can alone declare its true
meaning, and enforce its observance? There is certainly great
force in this reasoning, and it must be allowed to prove that a
constitutional road to the decision of the people ought to be
marked out and kept open, for certain great and extraordinary
occasions. But there appear to be insuperable objections against
the proposed recurrence to the people, as a provision in all
cases for keeping the several departments of power within their
constitutional limits. In the first place, the provision does not
reach the case of a combination of two of the departments against
the third. If the legislative authority, which possesses so many
means of operating on the motives of the other departments,
should be able to gain to its interest either of the others, or
even one third of its members, the remaining department could
derive no advantage from its remedial provision. I do not dwell,
however, on this objection, because it may be thought to be
rather against the modification of the principle, than against
the principle itself. In the next place, it may be considered as
an objection inherent in the principle, that as every appeal to
the people would carry an implication of some defect in the
government, frequent appeals would, in a great measure, deprive
the government of that veneration which time bestows on every
thing, and without which perhaps the wisest and freest
governments would not possess the requisite stability. If it be
true that all governments rest on opinion, it is no less true
that the strength of opinion in each individual, and its
practical influence on his conduct, depend much on the number
which he supposes to have entertained the same opinion. The
reason of man, like man himself, is timid and cautious when left
alone, and acquires firmness and confidence in proportion to the
number with which it is associated. When the examples which
fortify opinion are ANCIENT as well as NUMEROUS, they are known
to have a double effect. In a nation of philosophers, this
consideration ought to be disregarded. A reverence for the laws
would be sufficiently inculcated by the voice of an enlightened
reason. But a nation of philosophers is as little to be expected
as the philosophical race of kings wished for by Plato. And in
every other nation, the most rational government will not find it
a superfluous advantage to have the prejudices of the community
on its side. The danger of disturbing the public tranquillity by
interesting too strongly the public passions, is a still more
serious objection against a frequent reference of constitutional
questions to the decision of the whole society. Notwithstanding
the success which has attended the revisions of our established
forms of government, and which does so much honor to the virtue
and intelligence of the people of America, it must be confessed
that the experiments are of too ticklish a nature to be
unnecessarily multiplied. We are to recollect that all the
existing constitutions were formed in the midst of a danger which
repressed the passions most unfriendly to order and concord; of
an enthusiastic confidence of the people in their patriotic
leaders, which stifled the ordinary diversity of opinions on
great national questions; of a universal ardor for new and
opposite forms, produced by a universal resentment and
indignation against the ancient government; and whilst no spirit
of party connected with the changes to be made, or the abuses to
be reformed, could mingle its leaven in the operation. The future
situations in which we must expect to be usually placed, do not
present any equivalent security against the danger which is
apprehended. But the greatest objection of all is, that the
decisions which would probably result from such appeals would not
answer the purpose of maintaining the constitutional equilibrium
of the government. We have seen that the tendency of republican
governments is to an aggrandizement of the legislative at the
expense of the other departments. The appeals to the people,
therefore, would usually be made by the executive and judiciary
departments. But whether made by one side or the other, would
each side enjoy equal advantages on the trial? Let us view their
different situations. The members of the executive and judiciary
departments are few in number, and can be personally known to a
small part only of the people. The latter, by the mode of their
appointment, as well as by the nature and permanency of it, are
too far removed from the people to share much in their
prepossessions. The former are generally the objects of jealousy,
and their administration is always liable to be discolored and
rendered unpopular. The members of the legislative department, on
the other hand, are numberous. They are distributed and dwell
among the people at large. Their connections of blood, of
friendship, and of acquaintance embrace a great proportion of the
most influential part of the society. The nature of their public
trust implies a personal influence among the people, and that
they are more immediately the confidential guardians of the
rights and liberties of the people. With these advantages, it can
hardly be supposed that the adverse party would have an equal
chance for a favorable issue. But the legislative party would not
only be able to plead their cause most successfully with the
people. They would probably be constituted themselves the judges.
The same influence which had gained them an election into the
legislature, would gain them a seat in the convention. If this
should not be the case with all, it would probably be the case
with many, and pretty certainly with those leading characters, on
whom every thing depends in such bodies. The convention, in
short, would be composed chiefly of men who had been, who
actually were, or who expected to be, members of the department
whose conduct was arraigned. They would consequently be parties
to the very question to be decided by them. It might, however,
sometimes happen, that appeals would be made under circumstances
less adverse to the executive and judiciary departments. The
usurpations of the legislature might be so flagrant and so
sudden, as to admit of no specious coloring. A strong party
among themselves might take side with the other branches. The
executive power might be in the hands of a peculiar favorite of
the people. In such a posture of things, the public decision
might be less swayed by prepossessions in favor of the
legislative party. But still it could never be expected to turn
on the true merits of the question. It would inevitably be
connected with the spirit of pre-existing parties, or of parties
springing out of the question itself. It would be connected with
persons of distinguished character and extensive influence in the
community. It would be pronounced by the very men who had been
agents in, or opponents of, the measures to which the decision
would relate. The PASSIONS, therefore, not the REASON, of the
public would sit in judgment. But it is the reason, alone, of the
public, that ought to control and regulate the government. The
passions ought to be controlled and regulated by the government.
We found in the last paper, that mere declarations in the written
constitution are not sufficient to restrain the several
departments within their legal rights. It appears in this, that
occasional appeals to the people would be neither a proper nor an
effectual provision for that purpose. How far the provisions of a
different nature contained in the plan above quoted might be
adequate, I do not examine. Some of them are unquestionably
founded on sound political principles, and all of them are framed
with singular ingenuity and precision. PUBLIUS. 


FEDERALIST No. 50

Periodical Appeals to the People Considered
From the New York Packet. Tuesday, February 5, 1788. 

HAMILTON OR MADISON

To the People of the State of New York:
IT MAY be contended, perhaps, that instead of OCCASIONAL appeals
to the people, which are liable to the objections urged against
them, PERIODICAL appeals are the proper and adequate means of
PREVENTING AND CORRECTING INFRACTIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION. It
will be attended to, that in the examination of these expedients,
I confine myself to their aptitude for ENFORCING the
Constitution, by keeping the several departments of power within
their due bounds, without particularly considering them as
provisions for ALTERING the Constitution itself. In the first
view, appeals to the people at fixed periods appear to be nearly
as ineligible as appeals on particular occasions as they emerge.
If the periods be separated by short intervals, the measures to
be reviewed and rectified will have been of recent date, and will
be connected with all the circumstances which tend to vitiate and
pervert the result of occasional revisions. If the periods be
distant from each other, the same remark will be applicable to
all recent measures; and in proportion as the remoteness of the
others may favor a dispassionate review of them, this advantage
is inseparable from inconveniences which seem to counterbalance
it. In the first place, a distant prospect of public censure
would be a very feeble restraint on power from those excesses to
which it might be urged by the force of present motives. Is it to
be imagined that a legislative assembly, consisting of a hundred
or two hundred members, eagerly bent on some favorite object, and
breaking through the restraints of the Constitution in pursuit of
it, would be arrested in their career, by considerations drawn
from a censorial revision of their conduct at the future distance
of ten, fifteen, or twenty years? In the next place, the abuses
would often have completed their mischievous effects before the
remedial provision would be applied. And in the last place, where
this might not be the case, they would be of long standing, would
have taken deep root, and would not easily be extirpated. The
scheme of revising the constitution, in order to correct recent
breaches of it, as well as for other purposes, has been actually
tried in one of the States. One of the objects of the Council of
Censors which met in Pennsylvania in 1783 and 1784, was, as we
have seen, to inquire, ``whether the constitution had been
violated, and whether the legislative and executive departments
had encroached upon each other. '' This important and novel
experiment in politics merits, in several points of view, very
particular attention. In some of them it may, perhaps, as a
single experiment, made under circumstances somewhat peculiar, be
thought to be not absolutely conclusive. But as applied to the
case under consideration, it involves some facts, which I venture
to remark, as a complete and satisfactory illustration of the
reasoning which I have employed. First. It appears, from the
names of the gentlemen who composed the council, that some, at
least, of its most active members had also been active and
leading characters in the parties which pre-existed in the State.
Secondly. It appears that the same active and leading members of
the council had been active and influential members of the
legislative and executive branches, within the period to be
reviewed; and even patrons or opponents of the very measures to
be thus brought to the test of the constitution. Two of the
members had been vice-presidents of the State, and several other
members of the executive council, within the seven preceding
years. One of them had been speaker, and a number of others
distinguished members, of the legislative assembly within the
same period. Thirdly. Every page of their proceedings witnesses
the effect of all these circumstances on the temper of their
deliberations. Throughout the continuance of the council, it was
split into two fixed and violent parties. The fact is
acknowledged and lamented by themselves. Had this not been the
case, the face of their proceedings exhibits a proof equally
satisfactory. In all questions, however unimportant in
themselves, or unconnected with each other, the same names stand
invariably contrasted on the opposite columns. Every unbiased
observer may infer, without danger of mistake, and at the same
time without meaning to reflect on either party, or any
individuals of either party, that, unfortunately, PASSION, not
REASON, must have presided over their decisions. When men
exercise their reason coolly and freely on a variety of distinct
questions, they inevitably fall into different opinions on some
of them. When they are governed by a common passion, their
opinions, if they are so to be called, will be the same.
Fourthly. It is at least problematical, whether the decisions of
this body do not, in several instances, misconstrue the limits
prescribed for the legislative and executive departments, instead
of reducing and limiting them within their constitutional places.
Fifthly. I have never understood that the decisions of the
council on constitutional questions, whether rightly or
erroneously formed, have had any effect in varying the practice
founded on legislative constructions. It even appears, if I
mistake not, that in one instance the contemporary legislature
denied the constructions of the council, and actually prevailed
in the contest. This censorial body, therefore, proves at the
same time, by its researches, the existence of the disease, and
by its example, the inefficacy of the remedy. This conclusion
cannot be invalidated by alleging that the State in which the
experiment was made was at that crisis, and had been for a long
time before, violently heated and distracted by the rage of
party. Is it to be presumed, that at any future septennial epoch
the same State will be free from parties? Is it to be presumed
that any other State, at the same or any other given period, will
be exempt from them? Such an event ought to be neither presumed
nor desired; because an extinction of parties necessarily implies
either a universal alarm for the public safety, or an absolute
extinction of liberty. Were the precaution taken of excluding
from the assemblies elected by the people, to revise the
preceding administration of the government, all persons who
should have been concerned with the government within the given
period, the difficulties would not be obviated. The important
task would probably devolve on men, who, with inferior
capacities, would in other respects be little better qualified.
Although they might not have been personally concerned in the
administration, and therefore not immediately agents in the
measures to be examined, they would probably have been involved
in the parties connected with these measures, and have been
elected under their auspices. PUBLIUS. 


FEDERALIST No. 51

The Structure of the Government Must Furnish the Proper Checks
and Balances Between the Different Departments
From the New York Packet. Friday, February 8, 1788. 

HAMILTON OR MADISON

To the People of the State of New York:
TO WHAT expedient, then, shall we finally resort, for maintaining
in practice the necessary partition of power among the several
departments, as laid down in the Constitution? The only answer
that can be given is, that as all these exterior provisions are
found to be inadequate, the defect must be supplied, by so
contriving the interior structure of the government as that its
several constituent parts may, by their mutual relations, be the
means of keeping each other in their proper places. Without
presuming to undertake a full development of this important idea,
I will hazard a few general observations, which may perhaps place
it in a clearer light, and enable us to form a more correct
judgment of the principles and structure of the government
planned by the convention. In order to lay a due foundation for
that separate and distinct exercise of the different powers of
government, which to a certain extent is admitted on all hands to
be essential to the preservation of liberty, it is evident that
each department should have a will of its own; and consequently
should be so constituted that the members of each should have as
little agency as possible in the appointment of the members of
the others. Were this principle rigorously adhered to, it would
require that all the appointments for the supreme executive,
legislative, and judiciary magistracies should be drawn from the
same fountain of authority, the people, through channels having
no communication whatever with one another. Perhaps such a plan
of constructing the several departments would be less difficult
in practice than it may in contemplation appear. Some
difficulties, however, and some additional expense would attend
the execution of it. Some deviations, therefore, from the
principle must be admitted. In the constitution of the judiciary
department in particular, it might be inexpedient to insist
rigorously on the principle: first, because peculiar
qualifications being essential in the members, the primary
consideration ought to be to select that mode of choice which
best secures these qualifications; secondly, because the
permanent tenure by which the appointments are held in that
department, must soon destroy all sense of dependence on the
authority conferring them. It is equally evident, that the
members of each department should be as little dependent as
possible on those of the others, for the emoluments annexed to
their offices. Were the executive magistrate, or the judges, not
independent of the legislature in this particular, their
independence in every other would be merely nominal. But the
great security against a gradual concentration of the several
powers in the same department, consists in giving to those who
administer each department the necessary constitutional means and
personal motives to resist encroachments of the others. The
provision for defense must in this, as in all other cases, be
made commensurate to the danger of attack. Ambition must be made
to counteract ambition. The interest of the man must be
connected with the constitutional rights of the place. It may be
a reflection on human nature, that such devices should be
necessary to control the abuses of government. But what is
government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human
nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If
angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal
controls on government would be necessary. In framing a
government which is to be administered by men over men, the great
difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to
control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control
itself. A dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary
control on the government; but experience has taught mankind the
necessity of auxiliary precautions. This policy of supplying, by
opposite and rival interests, the defect of better motives, might
be traced through the whole system of human affairs, private as
well as public. We see it particularly displayed in all the
subordinate distributions of power, where the constant aim is to
divide and arrange the several offices in such a manner as that
each may be a check on the other that the private interest of
every individual may be a sentinel over the public rights. These
inventions of prudence cannot be less requisite in the
distribution of the supreme powers of the State. But it is not
possible to give to each department an equal power of
self-defense. In republican government, the legislative
authority necessarily predominates. The remedy for this
inconveniency is to divide the legislature into different
branches; and to render them, by different modes of election and
different principles of action, as little connected with each
other as the nature of their common functions and their common
dependence on the society will admit. It may even be necessary
to guard against dangerous encroachments by still further
precautions. As the weight of the legislative authority requires
that it should be thus divided, the weakness of the executive may
require, on the other hand, that it should be fortified. An
absolute negative on the legislature appears, at first view, to
be the natural defense with which the executive magistrate should
be armed. But perhaps it would be neither altogether safe nor
alone sufficient. On ordinary occasions it might not be exerted
with the requisite firmness, and on extraordinary occasions it
might be perfidiously abused. May not this defect of an absolute
negative be supplied by some qualified connection between this
weaker department and the weaker branch of the stronger
department, by which the latter may be led to support the
constitutional rights of the former, without being too much
detached from the rights of its own department? If the principles
on which these observations are founded be just, as I persuade
myself they are, and they be applied as a criterion to the
several State constitutions, and to the federal Constitution it
will be found that if the latter does not perfectly correspond
with them, the former are infinitely less able to bear such a
test. There are, moreover, two considerations particularly
applicable to the federal system of America, which place that
system in a very interesting point of view. First. In a single
republic, all the power surrendered by the people is submitted to
the administration of a single government; and the usurpations
are guarded against by a division of the government into distinct
and separate departments. In the compound republic of America,
the power surrendered by the people is first divided between two
distinct governments, and then the portion allotted to each
subdivided among distinct and separate departments. Hence a
double security arises to the rights of the people. The different
governments will control each other, at the same time that each
will be controlled by itself. Second. It is of great importance
in a republic not only to guard the society against the
oppression of its rulers, but to guard one part of the society
against the injustice of the other part. Different interests
necessarily exist in different classes of citizens. If a
majority be united by a common interest, the rights of the
minority will be insecure. There are but two methods of
providing against this evil: the one by creating a will in the
community independent of the majority that is, of the society
itself; the other, by comprehending in the society so many
separate descriptions of citizens as will render an unjust
combination of a majority of the whole very improbable, if not
impracticable. The first method prevails in all governments
possessing an hereditary or self-appointed authority. This, at
best, is but a precarious security; because a power independent
of the society may as well espouse the unjust views of the major,
as the rightful interests of the minor party, and may possibly be
turned against both parties. The second method will be
exemplified in the federal republic of the United States. Whilst
all authority in it will be derived from and dependent on the
society, the society itself will be broken into so many parts,
interests, and classes of citizens, that the rights of
individuals, or of the minority, will be in little danger from
interested combinations of the majority. In a free government
the security for civil rights must be the same as that for
religious rights. It consists in the one case in the
multiplicity of interests, and in the other in the multiplicity
of sects. The degree of security in both cases will depend on
the number of interests and sects; and this may be presumed to
depend on the extent of country and number of people comprehended
under the same government. This view of the subject must
particularly recommend a proper federal system to all the sincere
and considerate friends of republican government, since it shows
that in exact proportion as the territory of the Union may be
formed into more circumscribed Confederacies, or States
oppressive combinations of a majority will be facilitated: the
best security, under the republican forms, for the rights of
every class of citizens, will be diminished: and consequently the
stability and independence of some member of the government, the
only other security, must be proportionately increased. Justice
is the end of government. It is the end of civil society. It
ever has been and ever will be pursued until it be obtained, or
until liberty be lost in the pursuit. In a society under the
forms of which the stronger faction can readily unite and oppress
the weaker, anarchy may as truly be said to reign as in a state
of nature, where the weaker individual is not secured against the
violence of the stronger; and as, in the latter state, even the
stronger individuals are prompted, by the uncertainty of their
condition, to submit to a government which may protect the weak
as well as themselves; so, in the former state, will the more
powerful factions or parties be gradnally induced, by a like
motive, to wish for a government which will protect all parties,
the weaker as well as the more powerful. It can be little
doubted that if the State of Rhode Island was separated from the
Confederacy and left to itself, the insecurity of rights under
the popular form of government within such narrow limits would be
displayed by such reiterated oppressions of factious majorities
that some power altogether independent of the people would soon
be called for by the voice of the very factions whose misrule had
proved the necessity of it. In the extended republic of the
United States, and among the great variety of interests, parties,
and sects which it embraces, a coalition of a majority of the
whole society could seldom take place on any other principles
than those of justice and the general good; whilst there being
thus less danger to a minor from the will of a major party, there
must be less pretext, also, to provide for the security of the
former, by introducing into the government a will not dependent
on the latter, or, in other words, a will independent of the
society itself. It is no less certain than it is important,
notwithstanding the contrary opinions which have been
entertained, that the larger the society, provided it lie within
a practical sphere, the more duly capable it will be of
self-government. And happily for the REPUBLICAN CAUSE, the
practicable sphere may be carried to a very great extent, by a
judicious modification and mixture of the FEDERAL PRINCIPLE.

FEDERALIST No. 52

The House of Representatives
From the New York Packet. Friday, February 8, 1788. 

HAMILTON OR MADISON

To the People of the State of New York:
FROM the more general inquiries pursued in the four last papers,
I pass on to a more particular examination of the several parts
of the government. I shall begin with the House of
Representatives. The first view to be taken of this part of the
government relates to the qualifications of the electors and the
elected. Those of the former are to be the same with those of the
electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures.
The definition of the right of suffrage is very justly regarded
as a fundamental article of republican government. It was
incumbent on the convention, therefore, to define and establish
this right in the Constitution. To have left it open for the
occasional regulation of the Congress, would have been improper
for the reason just mentioned. To have submitted it to the
legislative discretion of the States, would have been improper
for the same reason; and for the additional reason that it would
have rendered too dependent on the State governments that branch
of the federal government which ought to be dependent on the
people alone. To have reduced the different qualifications in the
different States to one uniform rule, would probably have been as
dissatisfactory to some of the States as it would have been
difficult to the convention. The provision made by the convention
appears, therefore, to be the best that lay within their option.
It must be satisfactory to every State, because it is conformable
to the standard already established, or which may be established,
by the State itself. It will be safe to the United States,
because, being fixed by the State constitutions, it is not
alterable by the State governments, and it cannot be feared that
the people of the States will alter this part of their
constitutions in such a manner as to abridge the rights secured
to them by the federal Constitution. The qualifications of the
elected, being less carefully and properly defined by the State
constitutions, and being at the same time more susceptible of
uniformity, have been very properly considered and regulated by
the convention. A representative of the United States must be of
the age of twenty-five years; must have been seven years a
citizen of the United States; must, at the time of his election,
be an inhabitant of the State he is to represent; and, during the
time of his service, must be in no office under the United
States. Under these reasonable limitations, the door of this part
of the federal government is open to merit of every description,
whether native or adoptive, whether young or old, and without
regard to poverty or wealth, or to any particular profession of
religious faith. The term for which the representatives are to be
elected falls under a second view which may be taken of this
branch. In order to decide on the propriety of this article, two
questions must be considered: first, whether biennial elections
will, in this case, be safe; secondly, whether they be necessary
or useful. First. As it is essential to liberty that the
government in general should have a common interest with the
people, so it is particularly essential that the branch of it
under consideration should have an immediate dependence on, and
an intimate sympathy with, the people. Frequent elections are
unquestionably the only policy by which this dependence and
sympathy can be effectually secured. But what particular degree
of frequency may be absolutely necessary for the purpose, does
not appear to be susceptible of any precise calculation, and must
depend on a variety of circumstances with which it may be
connected. Let us consult experience, the guide that ought always
to be followed whenever it can be found. The scheme of
representation, as a substitute for a meeting of the citizens in
person, being at most but very imperfectly known to ancient
polity, it is in more modern times only that we are to expect
instructive examples. And even here, in order to avoid a research
too vague and diffusive, it will be proper to confine ourselves
to the few examples which are best known, and which bear the
greatest analogy to our particular case. The first to which this
character ought to be applied, is the House of Commons in Great
Britain. The history of this branch of the English Constitution,
anterior to the date of Magna Charta, is too obscure to yield
instruction. The very existence of it has been made a question
among political antiquaries. The earliest records of subsequent
date prove that parliaments were to SIT only every year; not that
they were to be ELECTED every year. And even these annual
sessions were left so much at the discretion of the monarch,
that, under various pretexts, very long and dangerous
intermissions were often contrived by royal ambition. To remedy
this grievance, it was provided by a statute in the reign of
Charles II. , that the intermissions should not be protracted
beyond a period of three years. On the accession of William III.
, when a revolution took place in the government, the subject was
still more seriously resumed, and it was declared to be among the
fundamental rights of the people that parliaments ought to be
held FREQUENTLY. By another statute, which passed a few years
later in the same reign, the term ``frequently,'' which had
alluded to the triennial period settled in the time of Charles
II. , is reduced to a precise meaning, it being expressly enacted
that a new parliament shall be called within three years after
the termination of the former. The last change, from three to
seven years, is well known to have been introduced pretty early
in the present century, under on alarm for the Hanoverian
succession. From these facts it appears that the greatest
frequency of elections which has been deemed necessary in that
kingdom, for binding the representatives to their constituents,
does not exceed a triennial return of them. And if we may argue
from the degree of liberty retained even under septennial
elections, and all the other vicious ingredients in the
parliamentary constitution, we cannot doubt that a reduction of
the period from seven to three years, with the other necessary
reforms, would so far extend the influence of the people over
their representatives as to satisfy us that biennial elections,
under the federal system, cannot possibly be dangerous to the
requisite dependence of the House of Representatives on their
constituents. Elections in Ireland, till of late, were regulated
entirely by the discretion of the crown, and were seldom
repeated, except on the accession of a new prince, or some other
contingent event. The parliament which commenced with George II.
was continued throughout his whole reign, a period of about
thirty-five years. The only dependence of the representatives on
the people consisted in the right of the latter to supply
occasional vacancies by the election of new members, and in the
chance of some event which might produce a general new election.
The ability also of the Irish parliament to maintain the rights
of their constituents, so far as the disposition might exist, was
extremely shackled by the control of the crown over the subjects
of their deliberation. Of late these shackles, if I mistake not,
have been broken; and octennial parliaments have besides been
established. What effect may be produced by this partial reform,
must be left to further experience. The example of Ireland, from
this view of it, can throw but little light on the subject. As
far as we can draw any conclusion from it, it must be that if the
people of that country have been able under all these
disadvantages to retain any liberty whatever, the advantage of
biennial elections would secure to them every degree of liberty,
which might depend on a due connection between their
representatives and themselves. Let us bring our inquiries nearer
home. The example of these States, when British colonies, claims
particular attention, at the same time that it is so well known
as to require little to be said on it. The principle of
representation, in one branch of the legislature at least, was
established in all of them. But the periods of election were
different. They varied from one to seven years. Have we any
reason to infer, from the spirit and conduct of the
representatives of the people, prior to the Revolution, that
biennial elections would have been dangerous to the public
liberties? The spirit which everywhere displayed itself at the
commencement of the struggle, and which vanquished the obstacles
to independence, is the best of proofs that a sufficient portion
of liberty had been everywhere enjoyed to inspire both a sense of
its worth and a zeal for its proper enlargement This remark holds
good, as well with regard to the then colonies whose elections
were least frequent, as to those whose elections were most
frequent Virginia was the colony which stood first in resisting
the parliamentary usurpations of Great Britain; it was the first
also in espousing, by public act, the resolution of independence.
In Virginia, nevertheless, if I have not been misinformed,
elections under the former government were septennial. This
particular example is brought into view, not as a proof of any
peculiar merit, for the priority in those instances was probably
accidental; and still less of any advantage in SEPTENNIAL
elections, for when compared with a greater frequency they are
inadmissible; but merely as a proof, and I conceive it to be a
very substantial proof, that the liberties of the people can be
in no danger from BIENNIAL elections. The conclusion resulting
from these examples will be not a little strengthened by
recollecting three circumstances. The first is, that the federal
legislature will possess a part only of that supreme legislative
authority which is vested completely in the British Parliament;
and which, with a few exceptions, was exercised by the colonial
assemblies and the Irish legislature. It is a received and
well-founded maxim, that where no other circumstances affect the
case, the greater the power is, the shorter ought to be its
duration; and, conversely, the smaller the power, the more safely
may its duration be protracted. In the second place, it has, on
another occasion, been shown that the federal legislature will
not only be restrained by its dependence on its people, as other
legislative bodies are, but that it will be, moreover, watched
and controlled by the several collateral legislatures, which
other legislative bodies are not. And in the third place, no
comparison can be made between the means that will be possessed
by the more permanent branches of the federal government for
seducing, if they should be disposed to seduce, the House of
Representatives from their duty to the people, and the means of
influence over the popular branch possessed by the other branches
of the government above cited. With less power, therefore, to
abuse, the federal representatives can be less tempted on one
side, and will be doubly watched on the other. PUBLIUS.

The Same Subject Continued(The House of Representatives)
From the New York Packet. Tuesday, February 12, 1788. 

HAMILTON OR MADISON

To the People of the State of New York:
I SHALL here, perhaps, be reminded of a current observation,
``that where annual elections end, tyranny begins. '' If it be
true, as has often been remarked, that sayings which become
proverbial are generally founded in reason, it is not less true,
that when once established, they are often applied to cases to
which the reason of them does not extend. I need not look for a
proof beyond the case before us. What is the reason on which this
proverbial observation is founded? No man will subject himself to
the ridicule of pretending that any natural connection subsists
between the sun or the seasons, and the period within which human
virtue can bear the temptations of power. Happily for mankind,
liberty is not, in this respect, confined to any single point of
time; but lies within extremes, which afford sufficient latitude
for all the variations which may be required by the various
situations and circumstances of civil society. The election of
magistrates might be, if it were found expedient, as in some
instances it actually has been, daily, weekly, or monthly, as
well as annual; and if circumstances may require a deviation from
the rule on one side, why not also on the other side? Turning our
attention to the periods established among ourselves, for the
election of the most numerous branches of the State legislatures,
we find them by no means coinciding any more in this instance,
than in the elections of other civil magistrates. In Connecticut
and Rhode Island, the periods are half-yearly. In the other
States, South Carolina excepted, they are annual. In South
Carolina they are biennial as is proposed in the federal
government. Here is a difference, as four to one, between the
longest and shortest periods; and yet it would be not easy to
show, that Connecticut or Rhode Island is better governed, or
enjoys a greater share of rational liberty, than South Carolina;
or that either the one or the other of these States is
distinguished in these respects, and by these causes, from the
States whose elections are different from both. In searching for
the grounds of this doctrine, I can discover but one, and that is
wholly inapplicable to our case. The important distinction so
well understood in America, between a Constitution established by
the people and unalterable by the government, and a law
established by the government and alterable by the government,
seems to have been little understood and less observed in any
other country. Wherever the supreme power of legislation has
resided, has been supposed to reside also a full power to change
the form of the government. Even in Great Britain, where the
principles of political and civil liberty have been most
discussed, and where we hear most of the rights of the
Constitution, it is maintained that the authority of the
Parliament is transcendent and uncontrollable, as well with
regard to the Constitution, as the ordinary objects of
legislative provision. They have accordingly, in several
instances, actually changed, by legislative acts, some of the
most fundamental articles of the government. They have in
particular, on several occasions, changed the period of election;
and, on the last occasion, not only introduced septennial in
place of triennial elections, but by the same act, continued
themselves in place four years beyond the term for which they
were elected by the people. An attention to these dangerous
practices has produced a very natural alarm in the votaries of
free government, of which frequency of elections is the
corner-stone; and has led them to seek for some security to
liberty, against the danger to which it is exposed. Where no
Constitution, paramount to the government, either existed or
could be obtained, no constitutional security, similar to that
established in the United States, was to be attempted. Some
other security, therefore, was to be sought for; and what better
security would the case admit, than that of selecting and
appealing to some simple and familiar portion of time, as a
standard for measuring the danger of innovations, for fixing the
national sentiment, and for uniting the patriotic exertions? The
most simple and familiar portion of time, applicable to the
subject was that of a year; and hence the doctrine has been
inculcated by a laudable zeal, to erect some barrier against the
gradual innovations of an unlimited government, that the advance
towards tyranny was to be calculated by the distance of departure
from the fixed point of annual elections. But what necessity can
there be of applying this expedient to a government limited, as
the federal government will be, by the authority of a paramount
Constitution? Or who will pretend that the liberties of the
people of America will not be more secure under biennial
elections, unalterably fixed by such a Constitution, than those
of any other nation would be, where elections were annual, or
even more frequent, but subject to alterations by the ordinary
power of the government? The second question stated is, whether
biennial elections be necessary or useful. The propriety of
answering this question in the affirmative will appear from
several very obvious considerations.                             
                                         No man can be a
competent legislator who does not add to an upright intention and
a sound judgment a certain degree of knowledge of the subjects on
which he is to legislate. A part of this knowledge may be
acquired by means of information which lie within the compass of
men in private as well as public stations. Another part can only
be attained, or at least thoroughly attained, by actual
experience in the station which requires the use of it. The
period of service, ought, therefore, in all such cases, to bear
some proportion to the extent of practical knowledge requisite to
the due performance of the service. The period of legislative
service established in most of the States for the more numerous
branch is, as we have seen, one year. The question then may be
put into this simple form: does the period of two years bear no
greater proportion to the knowledge requisite for federal
legislation than one year does to the knowledge requisite for
State legislation? The very statement of the question, in this
form, suggests the answer that ought to be given to it. In a
single State, the requisite knowledge relates to the existing
laws which are uniform throughout the State, and with which all
the citizens are more or less conversant; and to the general
affairs of the State, which lie within a small compass, are not
very diversified, and occupy much of the attention and
conversation of every class of people. The great theatre of the
United States presents a very different scene. The laws are so
far from being uniform, that they vary in every State; whilst the
public affairs of the Union are spread throughout a very
extensive region, and are extremely diversified by t e local
affairs connected with them, and can with difficulty be correctly
learnt in any other place than in the central councils to which a
knowledge of them will be brought by the representatives of every
part of the empire. Yet some knowledge of the affairs, and even
of the laws, of all the States, ought to be possessed by the
members from each of the States. How can foreign trade be
properly regulated by uniform laws, without some acquaintance
with the commerce, the ports, the usages, and the regulatious of
the different States? How can the trade between the different
States be duly regulated, without some knowledge of their
relative situations in these and other respects? How can taxes
be judiciously imposed and effectually collected, if they be not
accommodated to the different laws and local circumstances
relating to these objects in the different States? How can
uniform regulations for the militia be duly provided, without a
similar knowledge of many internal circumstances by which the
States are distinguished from each other? These are the
principal objects of federal legislation, and suggest most
forcibly the extensive information which the representatives
ought to acquire. The other interior objects will require a
proportional degree of information with regard to them. It is
true that all these difficulties will, by degrees, be very much
diminished. The most laborious task will be the proper
inauguration of the government and the primeval formation of a
federal code. Improvements on the first draughts will every year
become both easier and fewer. Past transactions of the
government will be a ready and accurate source of information to
new members. The affairs of the Union will become more and more
objects of curiosity and conversation among the citizens at
large. And the increased intercourse among those of different
States will contribute not a little to diffuse a mutual knowledge
of their affairs, as this again will contribute to a general
assimilation of their manners and laws. But with all these
abatements, the business of federal legislation must continue so
far to exceed, both in novelty and difficulty, the legislative
business of a single State, as to justify the longer period of
service assigned to those who are to transact it. A branch of
knowledge which belongs to the acquirements of a federal
representative, and which has not been mentioned is that of
foreign affairs. In regulating our own commerce he ought to be
not only acquainted with the treaties between the United States
and other nations, but also with the commercial policy and laws
of other nations. He ought not to be altogether ignorant of the
law of nations; for that, as far as it is a proper object of
municipal legislation, is submitted to the federal government.
And although the House of Representatives is not immediately to
participate in foreign negotiations and arrangements, yet from
the necessary connection between the several branches of public
affairs, those particular branches will frequently deserve
attention in the ordinary course of legislation, and will
sometimes demand particular legislative sanction and
co-operation. Some portion of this knowledge may, no doubt, be
acquired in a man's closet; but some of it also can only be
derived from the public sources of information; and all of it
will be acquired to best effect by a practical attention to the
subject during the period of actual service in the legislature.
There are other considerations, of less importance, perhaps, but
which are not unworthy of notice. The distance which many of the
representatives will be obliged to travel, and the arrangements
rendered necessary by that circumstance, might be much more
serious objections with fit men to this service, if limited to a
single year, than if extended to two years. No argument can be
drawn on this subject, from the case of the delegates to the
existing Congress. They are elected annually, it is true; but
their re-election is considered by the legislative assemblies
almost as a matter of course. The election of the representatives
by the people would not be governed by the same principle. A few
of the members, as happens in all such assemblies, will possess
superior talents; will, by frequent reelections, become members
of long standing; will be thoroughly masters of the public
business, and perhaps not unwilling to avail themselves of those
advantages. The greater the proportion of new members, and the
less the information of the bulk of the members the more apt will
they be to fall into the snares that may be laid for them. This
remark is no less applicable to the relation which will subsist
between the House of Representatives and the Senate. It is an
inconvenience mingled with the advantages of our frequent
elections even in single States, where they are large, and hold
but one legislative session in a year, that spurious elections
cannot be investigated and annulled in time for the decision to
have its due effect. If a return can be obtained, no matter by
what unlawful means, the irregular member, who takes his seat of
course, is sure of holding it a sufficient time to answer his
purposes. Hence, a very pernicious encouragement is given to the
use of unlawful means, for obtaining irregular returns. Were
elections for the federal legislature to be annual, this practice
might become a very serious abuse, particularly in the more
distant States. Each house is, as it necessarily must be, the
judge of the elections, qualifications, and returns of its
members; and whatever improvements may be suggested by
experience, for simplifying and accelerating the process in
disputed cases, so great a portion of a year would unavoidably
elapse, before an illegitimate member could be dispossessed of
his seat, that the prospect of such an event would be little
check to unfair and illicit means of obtaining a seat. All these
considerations taken together warrant us in affirming, that
biennial elections will be as useful to the affairs of the public
as we have seen that they will be safe to the liberty of the
people. PUBLIUS. 


FEDERALIST No. 54

The Apportionment of Members Among the States

From the New York Packet. Tuesday, February 12, 1788. 

HAMILTON OR MADISON

To the People of the State of New York:
THE next view which I shall take of the House of Representatives
relates to the appointment of its members to the several States
which is to be determined by the same rule with that of direct
taxes.                                                           
           It is not contended that the number of people in each
State ought not to be the standard for regulating the proportion
of those who are to represent the people of each State. The
establishment of the same rule for the appointment of taxes, will
probably be as little contested; though the rule itself in this
case, is by no means founded on the same principle. In the former
case, the rule is understood to refer to the personal rights of
the people, with which it has a natural and universal connection.
In the latter, it has reference to the proportion of wealth, of
which it is in no case a precise measure, and in ordinary cases a
very unfit one. But notwithstanding the imperfection of the rule
as applied to the relative wealth and contributions of the
States, it is evidently the least objectionable among the
practicable rules, and had too recently obtained the general
sanction of America, not to have found a ready preference with
the convention. All this is admitted, it will perhaps be said;
but does it follow, from an admission of numbers for the measure
of representation, or of slaves combined with free citizens as a
ratio of taxation, that slaves ought to be included in the
numerical rule of representation? Slaves are considered as
property, not as persons. They ought therefore to be comprehended
in estimates of taxation which are founded on property, and to be
excluded from representation which is regulated by a census of
persons. This is the objection, as I understand it, stated in its
full force. I shall be equally candid in stating the reasoning
which may be offered on the opposite side. ``We subscribe to the
doctrine,'' might one of our Southern brethren observe, ``that
representation relates more immediately to persons, and taxation
more immediately to property, and we join in the application of
this distinction to the case of our slaves. But we must deny the
fact, that slaves are considered merely as property, and in no
respect whatever as persons. The true state of the case is, that
they partake of both these qualities: being considered by our
laws, in some respects, as persons, and in other respects as
property. In being compelled to labor, not for himself, but for
a master; in being vendible by one master to another master; and
in being subject at all times to be restrained in his liberty and
chastised in his body, by the capricious will of another, the
slave may appear to be degraded from the human rank, and classed
with those irrational animals which fall under the legal
denomination of property. In being protected, on the other hand,
in his life and in his limbs, against the violence of all
others, even the master of his labor and his liberty; and in
being punishable himself for all violence committed against
others, the slave is no less evidently regarded by the law as a
member of the society, not as a part of the irrational creation;
as a moral person, not as a mere article of property. The
federal Constitution, therefore, decides with great propriety on
the case of our slaves, when it views them in the mixed character
of persons and of property. This is in fact their true
character. It is the character bestowed on them by the laws
under which they live; and it will not be denied, that these are
the proper criterion; because it is only under the pretext that
the laws have transformed the negroes into subjects of property,
that a place is disputed them in the computation of numbers; and
it is admitted, that if the laws were to restore the rights which
have been taken away, the negroes could no longer be refused an
equal share of representation with the other inhabitants. ``This
question may be placed in another light. It is agreed on all
sides, that numbers are the best scale of wealth and taxation, as
they are the only proper scale of representation. Would the
convention have been impartial or consistent, if they had
rejected the slaves from the list of inhabitants, when the shares
of representation were to be calculated, and inserted them on the
lists when the tariff of contributions was to be adjusted? Could
it be reasonably expected, that the Southern States would concur
in a system, which considered their slaves in some degree as men,
when burdens were to be imposed, but refused to consider them in
the same light, when advantages were to be conferred? Might not
some surprise also be expressed, that those who reproach the
Southern States with the barbarous policy of considering as
property a part of their human brethren, should themselves
contend, that the government to which all the States are to be
parties, ought to consider this unfortunate race more completely
in the unnatural light of property, than the very laws of which
they complain? ``It may be replied, perhaps, that slaves are not
included in the estimate of representatives in any of the States
possessing them. They neither vote themselves nor increase the
votes of their masters. Upon what principle, then, ought they to
be taken into the federal estimate of representation? In
rejecting them altogether, the Constitution would, in this
respect, have followed the very laws which have been appealed to
as the proper guide. ``This objection is repelled by a single
abservation. It is a fundamental principle of the proposed
Constitution, that as the aggregate number of representatives
allotted to the several States is to be determined by a federal
rule, founded on the aggregate number of inhabitants, so the
right of choosing this allotted number in each State is to be
exercised by such part of the inhabitants as the State itself may
designate. The qualifications on which the right of suffrage
depend are not, perhaps, the same in any two States. In some of
the States the difference is very material. In every State, a
certain proportion of inhabitants are deprived of this right by
the constitution of the State, who will be included in the census
by which the federal Constitution apportions the representatives.
In this point of view the Southern States might retort the
complaint, by insisting that the principle laid down by the
convention required that no regard should be had to the policy of
particular States towards their own inhabitants; and
consequently, that the slaves, as inhabitants, should have been
admitted into the census according to their full number, in like
manner with other inhabitants, who, by the policy of other
States, are not admitted to all the rights of citizens. A
rigorous adherence, however, to this principle, is waived by
those who would be gainers by it. All that they ask is that
equal moderation be shown on the other side. Let the case of the
slaves be considered, as it is in truth, a peculiar one. Let the
compromising expedient of the Constitution be mutually adopted,
which regards them as inhabitants, but as debased by servitude
below the equal level of free inhabitants, which regards the
SLAVE as divested of two fifths of the MAN. ``After all, may not
another ground be taken on which this article of the
Constitution will admit of a still more ready defense? We have
hitherto proceeded on the idea that representation related to
persons only, and not at all to property. But is it a just idea?
Government is instituted no less for protection of the property,
than of the persons, of individuals. The one as well as the
other, therefore, may be considered as represented by those who
are charged with the government. Upon this principle it is, that
in several of the States, and particularly in the State of New
York, one branch of the government is intended more especially to
be the guardian of property, and is accordingly elected by that
part of the society which is most interested in this object of
government. In the federal Constitution, this policy does not
prevail. The rights of property are committed into the same hands
with the personal rights. Some attention ought, therefore, to be
paid to property in the choice of those hands. ``For another
reason, the votes allowed in the federal legislature to the
people of each State, ought to bear some proportion to the
comparative wealth of the States. States have not, like
individuals, an influence over each other, arising from superior
advantages of fortune. If the law allows an opulent citizen but a
single vote in the choice of his representative, the respect and
consequence which he derives from his fortunate situation very
frequently guide the votes of others to the objects of his
choice; and through this imperceptible channel the rights of
property are conveyed into the public representation. A State
possesses no such influence over other States. It is not probable
that the richest State in the Confederacy will ever influence the
choice of a single representative in any other State. Nor will
the representatives of the larger and richer States possess any
other advantage in the federal legislature, over the
representatives of other States, than what may result from their
superior number alone. As far, therefore, as their superior
wealth and weight may justly entitle them to any advantage, it
ought to be secured to them by a superior share of
representation. The new Constitution is, in this respect,
materially different from the existing Confederation, as well as
from that of the United Netherlands, and other similar
confederacies. In each of the latter, the efficacy of the
federal resolutions depends on the subsequent and voluntary
resolutions of the states composing the union. Hence the states,
though possessing an equal vote in the public councils, have an
unequal influence, corresponding with the unequal importance of
these subsequent and voluntary resolutions. Under the proposed
Constitution, the federal acts will take effect without the
necessary intervention of the individual States. They will depend
merely on the majority of votes in the federal legislature, and
consequently each vote, whether proceeding from a larger or
smaller State, or a State more or less wealthy or powerful, will
have an equal weight and efficacy: in the same manner as the
votes individually given in a State legislature, by the
representatives of unequal counties or other districts, have
each a precise equality of value and effect; or if there be any
difference in the case, it proceeds from the difference in the
personal character of the individual representative, rather than
from any regard to the extent of the district from which he
comes. ''Such is the reasoning which an advocate for the
Southern interests might employ on this subject; and although it
may appear to be a little strained in some points, yet, on the
whole, I must confess that it fully reconciles me to the scale of
representation which the convention have established. In one
respect, the establishment of a common measure for representation
and taxation will have a very salutary effect. As the accuracy
of the census to be obtained by the Congress will necessarily
depend, in a considerable degree on the disposition, if not on
the co-operation, of the States, it is of great importance that
the States should feel as little bias as possible, to swell or to
reduce the amount of their numbers. Were their share of
representation alone to be governed by this rule, they would have
an interest in exaggerating their inhabitants. Were the rule to
decide their share of taxation alone, a contrary temptation would
prevail. By extending the rule to both objects, the States will
have opposite interests, which will control and balance each
other, and produce the requisite impartiality. PUBLIUS. 


FEDERALIST No. 55

The Total Number of the House of Representatives
From the New York Packet. Friday, February 15, 1788. 

HAMILTON OR MADISON

To the People of the State of New York:
THE number of which the House of Representatives is to consist,
forms another and a very interesting point of view, under which
this branch of the federal legislature may be contemplated.
Scarce any article, indeed, in the whole Constitution seems to be
rendered more worthy of attention, by the weight of character and
the apparent force of argument with which it has been assailed.
The charges exhibited against it are, first, that so small a
number of representatives will be an unsafe depositary of the
public interests; secondly, that they will not possess a proper
knowledge of the local circumstances of their numerous
constituents; thirdly, that they will be taken from that class of
citizens which will sympathize least with the feelings of the
mass of the people, and be most likely to aim at a permanent
elevation of the few on the depression of the many; fourthly,
that defective as the number will be in the first instance, it
will be more and more disproportionate, by the increase of the
people, and the obstacles which will prevent a correspondent
increase of the representatives. In general it may be remarked on
this subject, that no political problem is less susceptible of a
precise solution than that which relates to the number most
convenient for a representative legislature; nor is there any
point on which the policy of the several States is more at
variance, whether we compare their legislative assemblies
directly with each other, or consider the proportions which they
respectively bear to the number of their constituents. Passing
over the difference between the smallest and largest States, as
Delaware, whose most numerous branch consists of twenty-one
representatives, and Massachusetts, where it amounts to between
three and four hundred, a very considerable difference is
observable among States nearly equal in population. The number of
representatives in Pennsylvania is not more than one fifth of
that in the State last mentioned. New York, whose population is
to that of South Carolina as six to five, has little more than
one third of the number of representatives. As great a disparity
prevails between the States of Georgia and Delaware or Rhode
Island. In Pennsylvania, the representatives do not bear a
greater proportion to their constituents than of one for every
four or five thousand. In Rhode Island, they bear a proportion of
at least one for every thousand. And according to the
constitution of Georgia, the proportion may be carried to one to
every ten electors; and must unavoidably far exceed the
proportion in any of the other States. Another general remark to
be made is, that the ratio between the representatives and the
people ought not to be the same where the latter are very
numerous as where they are very few. Were the representatives in
Virginia to be regulated by the standard in Rhode Island, they
would, at this time, amount to between four and five hundred; and
twenty or thirty years hence, to a thousand. On the other hand,
the ratio of Pennsylvania, if applied to the State of Delaware,
would reduce the representative assembly of the latter to seven
or eight members. Nothing can be more fallacious than to found
our political calculations on arithmetical principles. Sixty or
seventy men may be more properly trusted with a given degree of
power than six or seven. But it does not follow that six or seven
hundred would be proportionably a better depositary. And if we
carry on the supposition to six or seven thousand, the whole
reasoning ought to be reversed. The truth is, that in all cases a
certain number at least seems to be necessary to secure the
benefits of free consultation and discussion, and to guard
against too easy a combination for improper purposes; as, on the
other hand, the number ought at most to be kept within a certain
limit, in order to avoid the confusion and intemperance of a
multitude. In all very numerous assemblies, of whatever character
composed, passion never fails to wrest the sceptre from reason.
Had every Athenian citizen been a Socrates, every Athenian
assembly would still have been a mob.                            
                                          It is necessary also to
recollect here the observations which were applied to the case of
biennial elections. For the same reason that the limited powers
of the Congress, and the control of the State legislatures,
justify less frequent elections than the public safely might
otherwise require, the members of the Congress need be less
numerous than if they possessed the whole power of legislation,
and were under no other than the ordinary restraints of other
legislative bodies. With these general ideas in our mind, let us
weigh the objections which have been stated against the number of
members proposed for the House of Representatives. It is said, in
the first place, that so small a number cannot be safely trusted
with so much power. The number of which this branch of the
legislature is to consist, at the outset of the government, will
be sixtyfive. Within three years a census is to be taken, when
the number may be augmented to one for every thirty thousand
inhabitants; and within every successive period of ten years the
census is to be renewed, and augmentations may continue to be
made under the above limitation. It will not be thought an
extravagant conjecture that the first census will, at the rate of
one for every thirty thousand, raise the number of
representatives to at least one hundred. Estimating the negroes
in the proportion of three fifths, it can scarcely be doubted
that the population of the United States will by that time, if it
does not already, amount to three millions. At the expiration of
twenty-five years, according to the computed rate of increase,
the number of representatives will amount to two hundred, and of
fifty years, to four hundred. This is a number which, I presume,
will put an end to all fears arising from the smallness of the
body. I take for granted here what I shall, in answering the
fourth objection, hereafter show, that the number of
representatives will be augmented from time to time in the
manner provided by the Constitution. On a contrary supposition, I
should admit the objection to have very great weight indeed. The
true question to be decided then is, whether the smallness of the
number, as a temporary regulation, be dangerous to the public
liberty? Whether sixty-five members for a few years, and a
hundred or two hundred for a few more, be a safe depositary for a
limited and well-guarded power of legislating for the United
States? I must own that I could not give a negative answer to
this question, without first obliterating every impression which
I have received with regard to the present genius of the people
of America, the spirit which actuates the State legislatures, and
the principles which are incorporated with the political
character of every class of citizens I am unable to conceive that
the people of America, in their present temper, or under any
circumstances which can speedily happen, will choose, and every
second year repeat the choice of, sixty-five or a hundred men who
would be disposed to form and pursue a scheme of tyranny or
treachery. I am unable to conceive that the State legislatures,
which must feel so many motives to watch, and which possess so
many means of counteracting, the federal legislature, would fail
either to detect or to defeat a conspiracy of the latter against
the liberties of their common constituents. I am equally unable
to conceive that there are at this time, or can be in any short
time, in the United States, any sixty-five or a hundred men
capable of recommending themselves to the choice of the people at
large, who would either desire or dare, within the short space of
two years, to betray the solemn trust committed to them. What
change of circumstances, time, and a fuller population of our
country may produce, requires a prophetic spirit to declare,
which makes no part of my pretensions. But judging from the
circumstances now before us, and from the probable state of them
within a moderate period of time, I must pronounce that the
liberties of America cannot be unsafe in the number of hands
proposed by the federal Constitution. From what quarter can the
danger proceed? Are we afraid of foreign gold? If foreign gold
could so easily corrupt our federal rulers and enable them to
ensnare and betray their constituents, how has it happened that
we are at this time a free and independent nation? The Congress
which conducted us through the Revolution was a less numerous
body than their successors will be; they were not chosen by, nor
responsible to, their fellowcitizens at large; though appointed
from year to year, and recallable at pleasure, they were
generally continued for three years, and prior to the
ratification of the federal articles, for a still longer term.
They held their consultations always under the veil of secrecy;
they had the sole transaction of our affairs with foreign
nations; through the whole course of the war they had the fate of
their country more in their hands than it is to be hoped will
ever be the case with our future representatives; and from the
greatness of the prize at stake, and the eagerness of the party
which lost it, it may well be supposed that the use of other
means than force would not have been scrupled. Yet we know by
happy experience that the public trust was not betrayed; nor has
the purity of our public councils in this particular ever
suffered, even from the whispers of calumny. Is the danger
apprehended from the other branches of the federal government?
But where are the means to be found by the President, or the
Senate, or both? Their emoluments of office, it is to be
presumed, will not, and without a previous corruption of the
House of Representatives cannot, more than suffice for very
different purposes; their private fortunes, as they must allbe
American citizens, cannot possibly be sources of danger. The
only means, then, which they can possess, will be in the
dispensation of appointments. Is it here that suspicion rests
her charge? Sometimes we are told that this fund of corruption
is to be exhausted by the President in subduing the virtue of the
Senate. Now, the fidelity of the other House is to be the
victim. The improbability of such a mercenary and perfidious
combination of the several members of government, standing on as
different foundations as republican principles will well admit,
and at the same time accountable to the society over which they
are placed, ought alone to quiet this apprehension. But,
fortunately, the Constitution has provided a still further
safeguard. The members of the Congress are rendered ineligible
to any civil offices that may be created, or of which the
emoluments may be increased, during the term of their election.
No offices therefore can be dealt out to the existing members but
such as may become vacant by ordinary casualties: and to suppose
that these would be sufficient to purchase the guardians of the
people, selected by the people themselves, is to renounce every
rule by which events ought to be calculated, and to substitute an
indiscriminate and unbounded jealousy, with which all reasoning
must be vain. The sincere friends of liberty, who give
themselves up to the extravagancies of this passion, are not
aware of the injury they do their own cause. As there is a
degree of depravity in mankind which requires a certain degree of
circumspection and distrust, so there are other qualities in
human nature which justify a certain portion of esteem and
confidence. Republican government presupposes the existence of
these qualities in a higher degree than any other form. Were the
pictures which have been drawn by the political jealousy of some
among us faithful likenesses of the human character, the
inference would be, that there is not sufficient virtue among men
for self-government; and that nothing less than the chains of
despotism can restrain them from destroying and devouring one
another. PUBLIUS. 


FEDERALIST No. 56

The Same Subject Continued(The Total Number of the House of
Representatives)
From the New York Packet. Tuesday, February 19, 1788. 

HAMILTON OR MADISON

To the People of the State of New York:
THE SECOND charge against the House of Representatives is, that
it will be too small to possess a due knowledge of the interests
of its constituents. As this objection evidently proceeds from a
comparison of the proposed number of representatives with the
great extent of the United States, the number of their
inhabitants, and the diversity of their interests, without taking
into view at the same time the circumstances which will
distinguish the Congress from other legislative bodies, the best
answer that can be given to it will be a brief explanation of
these peculiarities. It is a sound and important principle that
the representative ought to be acquainted with the interests and
circumstances of his constituents. But this principle can extend
no further than to those circumstances and interests to which the
authority and care of the representative relate. An ignorance of
a variety of minute and particular objects, which do not lie
within the compass of legislation, is consistent with every
attribute necessary to a due performance of the legislative
trust. In determining the extent of information required in the
exercise of a particular authority, recourse then must be had to
the objects within the purview of that authority. What are to be
the objects of federal legislation? Those which are of most
importance, and which seem most to require local knowledge, are
commerce, taxation, and the militia. A proper regulation of
commerce requires much information, as has been elsewhere
remarked; but as far as this information relates to the laws and
local situation of each individual State, a very few
representatives would be very sufficient vehicles of it to the
federal councils. Taxation will consist, in a great measure, of
duties which will be involved in the regulation of commerce. So
far the preceding remark is applicable to this object. As far as
it may consist of internal collections, a more diffusive
knowledge of the circumstances of the State may be necessary. But
will not this also be possessed in sufficient degree by a very
few intelligent men, diffusively elected within the State? Divide
the largest State into ten or twelve districts, and it will be
found that there will be no peculiar local interests in either,
which will not be within the knowledge of the representative of
the district. Besides this source of information, the laws of the
State, framed by representatives from every part of it, will be
almost of themselves a sufficient guide. In every State there
have been made, and must continue to be made, regulations on this
subject which will, in many cases, leave little more to be done
by the federal legislature, than to review the different laws,
and reduce them in one general act. A skillful individual in his
closet with all the local codes before him, might compile a law
on some subjects of taxation for the whole union, without any aid
from oral information, and it may be expected that whenever
internal taxes may be necessary, and particularly in cases
requiring uniformity throughout the States, the more simple
objects will be preferred. To be fully sensible of the facility
which will be given to this branch of federal legislation by the
assistance of the State codes, we need only suppose for a moment
that this or any other State were divided into a number of parts,
each having and exercising within itself a power of local
legislation. Is it not evident that a degree of local information
and preparatory labor would be found in the several volumes of
their proceedings, which would very much shorten the labors of
the general legislature, and render a much smaller number of
members sufficient for it? The federal councils will derive great
advantage from another circumstance. The representatives of each
State will not only bring with them a considerable knowledge of
its laws, and a local knowledge of their respective districts,
but will probably in all cases have been members, and may even at
the very time be members, of the State legislature, where all the
local information and interests of the State are assembled, and
from whence they may easily be conveyed by a very few hands into
the legislature of the United States. The observations made on
the subject of taxation apply with greater force to the case of
the militia. For however different the rules of discipline may be
in different States, they are the same throughout each particular
State; and depend on circumstances which can differ but little in
different parts of the same State. The attentive reader will
discern that the reasoning here used, to prove the sufficiency of
a moderate number of representatives, does not in any respect
contradict what was urged on another occasion with regard to the
extensive information which the representatives ought to possess,
and the time that might be necessary for acquiring it. This
information, so far as it may relate to local objects, is
rendered necessary and difficult, not by a difference of laws and
local circumstances within a single State, but of those among
different States. Taking each State by itself, its laws are the
same, and its interests but little diversified. A few men,
therefore, will possess all the knowledge requisite for a proper
representation of them. Were the interests and affairs of each
individual State perfectly simple and uniform, a knowledge of
them in one part would involve a knowledge of them in every
other, and the whole State might be competently represented by a
single member taken from any part of it. On a comparison of the
different States together, we find a great dissimilarity in their
laws, and in many other circumstances connected with the objects
of federal legislation, with all of which the federal
representatives ought to have some acquaintance. Whilst a few
representatives, therefore, from each State, may bring with them
a due knowledge of their own State, every representative will
have much information to acquire concerning all the other States.
The changes of time, as was formerly remarked, on the comparative
situation of the different States, will have an assimilating
effect. The effect of time on the internal affairs of the States,
taken singly, will be just the contrary. At present some of the
States are little more than a society of husbandmen. Few of them
have made much progress in those branches of industry which give
a variety and complexity to the affairs of a nation. These,
however, will in all of them be the fruits of a more advanced
population, and will require, on the part of each State, a fuller
representation. The foresight of the convention has accordingly
taken care that the progress of population may be accompanied
with a proper increase of the representative branch of the
government. The experience of Great Britain, which presents to
mankind so many political lessons, both of the monitory and
exemplary kind, and which has been frequently consulted in the
course of these inquiries, corroborates the result of the
reflections which we have just made. The number of inhabitants in
the two kingdoms of England and Scotland cannot be stated at less
than eight millions. The representatives of these eight millions
in the House of Commons amount to five hundred and fifty-eight.
Of this number, one ninth are elected by three hundred and
sixty-four persons, and one half, by five thousand seven hundred
and twenty-three persons. 1 It cannot be supposed that the half
thus elected, and who do not even reside among the people at
large, can add any thing either to the security of the people
against the government, or to the knowledge of their
circumstances and interests in the legislative councils. On the
contrary, it is notorious, that they are more frequently the
representatives and instruments of the executive magistrate, than
the guardians and advocates of the popular rights. They might
therefore, with great propriety, be considered as something more
than a mere deduction from the real representatives of the
nation. We will, however, consider them in this light alone, and
will not extend the deduction to a considerable number of
others, who do not reside among their constitutents, are very
faintly connected with them, and have very little particular
knowledge of their affairs. With all these concessions, two
hundred and seventy-nine persons only will be the depository of
the safety, interest, and happiness of eight millions that is to
say, there will be one representative only to maintain the rights
and explain the situation OF TWENTY-EIGHT THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED
AND SEVENTY constitutents, in an assembly exposed to the whole
force of executive influence, and extending its authority to
every object of legislation within a nation whose affairs are in
the highest degree diversified and complicated. Yet it is very
certain, not only that a valuable portion of freedom has been
preserved under all these circumstances, but that the defects in
the British code are chargeable, in a very small proportion, on
the ignorance of the legislature concerning the circumstances of
the people. Allowing to this case the weight which is due to it,
and comparing it with that of the House of Representatives as
above explained it seems to give the fullest assurance, that a
representative for every THIRTY THOUSAND INHABITANTS will render
the latter both a safe and competent guardian of the interests
which will be confided to it. PUBLIUS. Burgh's ``Political
Disquisitions. ''


FEDERALIST No. 57

The Alleged Tendency of the New Plan to Elevate the Few at the
Expense of the Many Considered in Connection with Representation
From the New York Packet. Tuesday, February 19, 1788. 

HAMILTON OR MADISON

To the People of the State of New York:
THE THIRD charge against the House of Representatives is, that it
will be taken from that class of citizens which will have least
sympathy with the mass of the people, and be most likely to aim
at an ambitious sacrifice of the many to the aggrandizement of
the few. Of all the objections which have been framed against the
federal Constitution, this is perhaps the most extraordinary.
Whilst the objection itself is levelled against a pretended
oligarchy, the principle of it strikes at the very root of
republican government. The aim of every political constitution
is, or ought to be, first to obtain for rulers men who possess
most wisdom to discern, and most virtue to pursue, the common
good of the society; and in the next place, to take the most
effectual precautions for keeping them virtuous whilst they
continue to hold their public trust. The elective mode of
obtaining rulers is the characteristic policy of republican
government. The means relied on in this form of government for
preventing their degeneracy are numerous and various. The most
effectual one, is such a limitation of the term of appointments
as will maintain a proper responsibility to the people. Let me
now ask what circumstance there is in the constitution of the
House of Representatives that violates the principles of
republican government, or favors the elevation of the few on the
ruins of the many? Let me ask whether every circumstance is not,
on the contrary, strictly conformable to these principles, and
scrupulously impartial to the rights and pretensions of every
class and description of citizens? Who are to be the electors of
the federal representatives? Not the rich, more than the poor;
not the learned, more than the ignorant; not the haughty heirs of
distinguished names, more than the humble sons of obscurity and
unpropitious fortune. The electors are to be the great body of
the people of the United States. They are to be the same who
exercise the right in every State of electing the corresponding
branch of the legislature of the State. Who are to be the objects
of popular choice? Every citizen whose merit may recommend him to
the esteem and confidence of his country. No qualification of
wealth, of birth, of religious faith, or of civil profession is
permitted to fetter the judgement or disappoint the inclination
of the people. If we consider the situation of the men on whom
the free suffrages of their fellow-citizens may confer the
representative trust, we shall find it involving every security
which can be devised or desired for their fidelity to their
constituents. In the first place, as they will have been
distinguished by the preference of their fellow-citizens, we are
to presume that in general they will be somewhat distinguished
also by those qualities which entitle them to it, and which
promise a sincere and scrupulous regard to the nature of their
engagements. In the second place, they will enter into the public
service under circumstances which cannot fail to produce a
temporary affection at least to their constituents. There is in
every breast a sensibility to marks of honor, of favor, of
esteem, and of confidence, which, apart from all considerations
of interest, is some pledge for grateful and benevolent returns.
Ingratitude is a common topic of declamation against human
nature; and it must be confessed that instances of it are but too
frequent and flagrant, both in public and in private life. But
the universal and extreme indignation which it inspires is itself
a proof of the energy and prevalence of the contrary sentiment.
In the third place, those ties which bind the representative to
his constituents are strengthened by motives of a more selfish
nature. His pride and vanity attach him to a form of government
which favors his pretensions and gives him a share in its honors
and distinctions. Whatever hopes or projects might be entertained
by a few aspiring characters, it must generally happen that a
great proportion of the men deriving their advancement from their
influence with the people, would have more to hope from a
preservation of the favor, than from innovations in the
government subversive of the authority of the people. All these
securities, however, would be found very insufficient without the
restraint of frequent elections. Hence, in the fourth place, the
House of Representatives is so constituted as to support in the
members an habitual recollection of their dependence on the
people. Before the sentiments impressed on their minds by the
mode of their elevation can be effaced by the exercise of power,
they will be compelled to anticipate the moment when their power
is to cease, when their exercise of it is to be reviewed, and
when they must descend to the level from which they were raised;
there forever to remain unless a faithful discharge of their
trust shall have established their title to a renewal of it. I
will add, as a fifth circumstance in the situation of the House
of Representatives, restraining them from oppressive measures,
that they can make no law which will not have its full operation
on themselves and their friends, as well as on the great mass of
the society. This has always been deemed one of the strongest
bonds by which human policy can connect the rulers and the people
together. It creates between them that communion of interests and
sympathy of sentiments, of which few governments have furnished
examples; but without which every government degenerates into
tyranny. If it be asked, what is to restrain the House of
Representatives from making legal discriminations in favor of
themselves and a particular class of the society? I answer: the
genius of the whole system; the nature of just and constitutional
laws; and above all, the vigilant and manly spirit which actuates
the people of America, a spirit which nourishes freedom, and in
return is nourished by it. If this spirit shall ever be so far
debased as to tolerate a law not obligatory on the legislature,
as well as on the people, the people will be prepared to tolerate
any thing but liberty. Such will be the relation between the
House of Representatives and their constituents. Duty, gratitude,
interest, ambition itself, are the chords by which they will be
bound to fidelity and sympathy with the great mass of the people.
It is possible that these may all be insufficient to control the
caprice and wickedness of man. But are they not all that
government will admit, and that human prudence can devise? Are
they not the genuine and the characteristic means by which
republican government provides for the liberty and happiness of
the people? Are they not the identical means on which every State
government in the Union relies for the attainment of these
important ends? What then are we to understand by the objection
which this paper has combated? What are we to say to the men who
profess the most flaming zeal for republican government, yet
boldly impeach the fundamental principle of it; who pretend to be
champions for the right and the capacity of the people to choose
their own rulers, yet maintain that they will prefer those only
who will immediately and infallibly betray the trust committed to
them? Were the objection to be read by one who had not seen the
mode prescribed by the Constitution for the choice of
representatives, he could suppose nothing less than that some
unreasonable qualification of property was annexed to the right
of suffrage; or that the right of eligibility was limited to
persons of particular families or fortunes; or at least that the
mode prescribed by the State constitutions was in some respect or
other, very grossly departed from. We have seen how far such a
supposition would err, as to the two first points. Nor would it,
in fact, be less erroneous as to the last. The only difference
discoverable between the two cases is, that each representative
of the United States will be elected by five or six thousand
citizens; whilst in the individual States, the election of a
representative is left to about as many hundreds. Will it be
pretended that this difference is sufficient to justify an
attachment to the State governments, and an abhorrence to the
federal government? If this be the point on which the objection
turns, it deserves to be examined. Is it supported by REASON?
This cannot be said, without maintaining that five or six
thousand citizens are less capable of choosing a fit
representative, or more liable to be corrupted by an unfit one,
than five or six hundred. Reason, on the contrary, assures us,
that as in so great a number a fit representative would be most
likely to be found, so the choice would be less likely to be
diverted from him by the intrigues of the ambitious or the
ambitious or the bribes of the rich. Is the CONSEQUENCE from
this doctrine admissible? If we say that five or six hundred
citizens are as many as can jointly exercise their right of
suffrage, must we not deprive the people of the immediate choice
of their public servants, in every instance where the
administration of the government does not require as many of them
as will amount to one for that number of citizens? Is the
doctrine warranted by FACTS? It was shown in the last paper, that
the real representation in the British House of Commons very
little exceeds the proportion of one for every thirty thousand
inhabitants. Besides a variety of powerful causes not existing
here, and which favor in that country the pretensions of rank and
wealth, no person is eligible as a representative of a county,
unless he possess real estate of the clear value of six hundred
pounds sterling per year; nor of a city or borough, unless he
possess a like estate of half that annual value. To this
qualification on the part of the county representatives is added
another on the part of the county electors, which restrains the
right of suffrage to persons having a freehold estate of the
annual value of more than twenty pounds sterling, according to
the present rate of money. Notwithstanding these unfavorable
circumstances, and notwithstanding some very unequal laws in the
British code, it cannot be said that the representatives of the
nation have elevated the few on the ruins of the many. But we
need not resort to foreign experience on this subject. Our own
is explicit and decisive. The districts in New Hampshire in
which the senators are chosen immediately by the people, are
nearly as large as will be necessary for her representatives in
the Congress. Those of Massachusetts are larger than will be
necessary for that purpose; and those of New York still more so.
In the last State the members of Assembly for the cities and
counties of New York and Albany are elected by very nearly as
many voters as will be entitled to a representative in the
Congress, calculating on the number of sixty-five representatives
only. It makes no difference that in these senatorial districts
and counties a number of representatives are voted for by each
elector at the same time. If the same electors at the same time
are capable of choosing four or five representatives, they cannot
be incapable of choosing one. Pennsylvania is an additional
example. Some of her counties, which elect her State
representatives, are almost as large as her districts will be by
which her federal representatives will be elected. The city of
Philadelphia is supposed to contain between fifty and sixty
thousand souls. It will therefore form nearly two districts for
the choice of federal representatives. It forms, however, but
one county, in which every elector votes for each of its
representatives in the State legislature. And what may appear to
be still more directly to our purpose, the whole city actually
elects a SINGLE MEMBER for the executive council. This is the
case in all the other counties of the State. Are not these facts
the most satisfactory proofs of the fallacy which has been
employed against the branch of the federal government under
consideration? Has it appeared on trial that the senators of New
Hampshire, Massachusetts, and New York, or the executive council
of Pennsylvania, or the members of the Assembly in the two last
States, have betrayed any peculiar disposition to sacrifice the
many to the few, or are in any respect less worthy of their
places than the representatives and magistrates appointed in
other States by very small divisions of the people? But there are
cases of a stronger complexion than any which I have yet quoted.
One branch of the legislature of Connecticut is so constituted
that each member of it is elected by the whole State. So is the
governor of that State, of Massachusetts, and of this State, and
the president of New Hampshire. I leave every man to decide
whether the result of any one of these experiments can be said to
countenance a suspicion, that a diffusive mode of choosing
representatives of the people tends to elevate traitors and to
undermine the public liberty. PUBLIUS. 


FEDERALIST No. 58
Objection That The Number of Members Will Not Be Augmented as the
Progress of Population Demands Considered 

MADISON

To the People of the State of New York:
THE remaining charge against the House of Representatives, which
I am to examine, is grounded on a supposition that the number of
members will not be augmented from time to time, as the progress
of population may demand. It has been admitted, that this
objection, if well supported, would have great weight. The
following observations will show that, like most other objections
against the Constitution, it can only proceed from a partial view
of the subject, or from a jealousy which discolors and disfigures
every object which is beheld. 1. Those who urge the objection
seem not to have recollected that the federal Constitution will
not suffer by a comparison with the State constitutions, in the
security provided for a gradual augmentation of the number of
representatives. The number which is to prevail in the first
instance is declared to be temporary. Its duration is limited to
the short term of three years. Within every successive term of
ten years a census of inhabitants is to be repeated. The
unequivocal objects of these regulations are, first, to readjust,
from time to time, the apportionment of representatives to the
number of inhabitants, under the single exception that each State
shall have one representative at least; secondly, to augment the
number of representatives at the same periods, under the sole
limitation that the whole number shall not exceed one for every
thirty thousand inhabitants. If we review the constitutions of
the several States, we shall find that some of them contain no
determinate regulations on this subject, that others correspond
pretty much on this point with the federal Constitution, and that
the most effectual security in any of them is resolvable into a
mere directory provision. 2. As far as experience has taken place
on this subject, a gradual increase of representatives under the
State constitutions has at least kept pace with that of the
constituents, and it appears that the former have been as ready
to concur in such measures as the latter have been to call for
them. 3. There is a peculiarity in the federal Constitution which
insures a watchful attention in a majority both of the people and
of their representatives to a constitutional augmentation of the
latter. The peculiarity lies in this, that one branch of the
legislature is a representation of citizens, the other of the
States: in the former, consequently, the larger States will have
most weight; in the latter, the advantage will be in favor of the
smaller States. From this circumstance it may with certainty be
inferred that the larger States will be strenuous advocates for
increasing the number and weight of that part of the legislature
in which their influence predominates. And it so happens that
four only of the largest will have a majority of the whole votes
in the House of Representatives. Should the representatives or
people, therefore, of the smaller States oppose at any time a
reasonable addition of members, a coalition of a very few States
will be sufficient to overrule the opposition; a coalition which,
notwithstanding the rivalship and local prejudices which might
prevent it on ordinary occasions, would not fail to take place,
when not merely prompted by common interest, but justified by
equity and the principles of the Constitution. It may be
alleged, perhaps, that the Senate would be prompted by like
motives to an adverse coalition; and as their concurrence would
be indispensable, the just and constitutional views of the other
branch might be defeated. This is the difficulty which has
probably created the most serious apprehensions in the jealous
friends of a numerous representation. Fortunately it is among
the difficulties which, existing only in appearance, vanish on a
close and accurate inspection. The following reflections will,
if I mistake not, be admitted to be conclusive and satisfactory
on this point. Notwithstanding the equal authority which will
subsist between the two houses on all legislative subjects,
except the originating of money bills, it cannot be doubted that
the House, composed of the greater number of members, when
supported by the more powerful States, and speaking the known and
determined sense of a majority of the people, will have no small
advantage in a question depending on the comparative firmness of
the two houses. This advantage must be increased by the
consciousness, felt by the same side of being supported in its
demands by right, by reason, and by the Constitution; and the
consciousness, on the opposite side, of contending against the
force of all these solemn considerations. It is farther to be
considered, that in the gradation between the smallest and
largest States, there are several, which, though most likely in
general to arrange themselves among the former are too little
removed in extent and population from the latter, to second an
opposition to their just and legitimate pretensions. Hence it is
by no means certain that a majority of votes, even in the
Senate, would be unfriendly to proper augmentations in the number
of representatives. It will not be looking too far to add, that
the senators from all the new States may be gained over to the
just views of the House of Representatives, by an expedient too
obvious to be overlooked. As these States will, for a great
length of time, advance in population with peculiar rapidity,
they will be interested in frequent reapportionments of the
representatives to the number of inhabitants. The large States,
therefore, who will prevail in the House of Representatives, will
have nothing to do but to make reapportionments and augmentations
mutually conditions of each other; and the senators from all the
most growing States will be bound to contend for the latter, by
the interest which their States will feel in the former. These
considerations seem to afford ample security on this subject, and
ought alone to satisfy all the doubts and fears which have been
indulged with regard to it. Admitting, however, that they should
all be insufficient to subdue the unjust policy of the smaller
States, or their predominant influence in the councils of the
Senate, a constitutional and infallible resource still remains
with the larger States, by which they will be able at all times
to accomplish their just purposes. The House of Representatives
cannot only refuse, but they alone can propose, the supplies
requisite for the support of government. They, in a word, hold
the purse that powerful instrument by which we behold, in the
history of the British Constitution, an infant and humble
representation of the people gradually enlarging the sphere of
its activity and importance, and finally reducing, as far as it
seems to have wished, all the overgrown prerogatives of the other
branches of the government. This power over the purse may, in
fact, be regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon with
which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of
the people, for obtaining a redress of every grievance, and for
carrying into effect every just and salutary measure. But will
not the House of Representatives be as much interested as the
Senate in maintaining the government in its proper functions, and
will they not therefore be unwilling to stake its existence or
its reputation on the pliancy of the Senate? Or, if such a trial
of firmness between the two branches were hazarded, would not the
one be as likely first to yield as the other? These questions
will create no difficulty with those who reflect that in all
cases the smaller the number, and the more permanent and
conspicuous the station, of men in power, the stronger must be
the interest which they will individually feel in whatever
concerns the government. Those who represent the dignity of their
country in the eyes of other nations, will be particularly
sensible to every prospect of public danger, or of dishonorable
stagnation in public affairs. To those causes we are to ascribe
the continual triumph of the British House of Commons over the
other branches of the government, whenever the engine of a money
bill has been employed. An absolute inflexibility on the side of
the latter, although it could not have failed to involve every
department of the state in the general confusion, has neither
been apprehended nor experienced. The utmost degree of firmness
that can be displayed by the federal Senate or President, will
not be more than equal to a resistance in which they will be
supported by constitutional and patriotic principles. In this
review of the Constitution of the House of Representatives, I
have passed over the circumstances of economy, which, in the
present state of affairs, might have had some effect in lessening
the temporary number of representatives, and a disregard of which
would probably have been as rich a theme of declamation against
the Constitution as has been shown by the smallness of the number
proposed. I omit also any remarks on the difficulty which might
be found, under present circumstances, in engaging in the federal
service a large number of such characters as the people will
probably elect. One observation, however, I must be permitted to
add on this subject as claiming, in my judgment, a very serious
attention. It is, that in all legislative assemblies the greater
the number composing them may be, the fewer will be the men who
will in fact direct their proceedings. In the first place, the
more numerous an assembly may be, of whatever characters
composed, the greater is known to be the ascendency of passion
over reason. In the next place, the larger the number, the
greater will be the proportion of members of limited information
and of weak capacities. Now, it is precisely on characters of
this description that the eloquence and address of the few are
known to act with all their force. In the ancient republics,
where the whole body of the people assembled in person, a single
orator, or an artful statesman, was generally seen to rule with
as complete a sway as if a sceptre had been placed in his single
hand. On the same principle, the more multitudinous a
representative assembly may be rendered, the more it will partake
of the infirmities incident to collective meetings of the people.
Ignorance will be the dupe of cunning, and passion the slave of
sophistry and declamation. The people can never err more than in
supposing that by multiplying their representatives beyond a
certain limit, they strengthen the barrier against the government
of a few. Experience will forever admonish them that, on the
contrary, AFTER SECURING A SUFFICIENT NUMBER FOR THE PURPOSES OF
SAFETY, OF LOCAL INFORMATION, AND OF DIFFUSIVE SYMPATHY WITH THE
WHOLE SOCIETY, they will counteract their own views by every
addition to their representatives. The countenance of the
government may become more democratic, but the soul that animates
it will be more oligarchic. The machine will be enlarged, but the
fewer, and often the more secret, will be the springs by which
its motions are directed. As connected with the objection against
the number of representatives, may properly be here noticed, that
which has been suggested against the number made competent for
legislative business. It has been said that more than a majority
ought to have been required for a quorum; and in particular
cases, if not in all, more than a majority of a quorum for a
decision. That some advantages might have resulted from such a
precaution, cannot be denied. It might have been an additional
shield to some particular interests, and another obstacle
generally to hasty and partial measures. But these considerations
are outweighed by the inconveniences in the opposite scale. In
all cases where justice or the general good might require new
laws to be passed, or active measures to be pursued, the
fundamental principle of free government would be reversed. It
would be no longer the majority that would rule: the power would
be transferred to the minority. Were the defensive privilege
limited to particular cases, an interested minority might take
advantage of it to screen themselves from equitable sacrifices to
the general weal, or, in particular emergencies, to extort
unreasonable indulgences. Lastly, it would facilitate and foster
the baneful practice of secessions; a practice which has shown
itself even in States where a majority only is required; a
practice subversive of all the principles of order and regular
government; a practice which leads more directly to public
convulsions, and the ruin of popular governments, than any other
which has yet been displayed among us. PUBLIUS. 


FEDERALIST No. 59

Concerning the Power of Congress to Regulate the Election of
Members
From the New York Packet. Friday, February 22, 1788. 

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
THE natural order of the subject leads us to consider, in this
place, that provision of the Constitution which authorizes the
national legislature to regulate, in the last resort, the
election of its own members. It is in these words: ``The TIMES,
PLACES, and MANNER of holding elections for senators and
representatives shall be prescribed in each State by the
legislature thereof; but the Congress may, at any time, by law,
make or alter SUCH REGULATIONS, except as to the PLACES of
choosing senators. ''1 This provision has not only been declaimed
against by those who condemn the Constitution in the gross, but
it has been censured by those who have objected with less
latitude and greater moderation; and, in one instance it has been
thought exceptionable by a gentleman who has declared himself the
advocate of every other part of the system. I am greatly
mistaken, notwithstanding, if there be any article in the whole
plan more completely defensible than this. Its propriety rests
upon the evidence of this plain proposition, that EVERY
GOVERNMENT OUGHT TO CONTAIN IN ITSELF THE MEANS OF ITS OWN
PRESERVATION. Every just reasoner will, at first sight, approve
an adherence to this rule, in the work of the convention; and
will disapprove every deviation from it which may not appear to
have been dictated by the necessity of incorporating into the
work some particular ingredient, with which a rigid conformity to
the rule was incompatible. Even in this case, though he may
acquiesce in the necessity, yet he will not cease to regard and
to regret a departure from so fundamental a principle, as a
portion of imperfection in the system which may prove the seed of
future weakness, and perhaps anarchy. It will not be alleged,
that an election law could have been framed and inserted in the
Constitution, which would have been always applicable to every
probable change in the situation of the country; and it will
therefore not be denied, that a discretionary power over
elections ought to exist somewhere. It will, I presume, be as
readily conceded, that there were only three ways in which this
power could have been reasonably modified and disposed: that it
must either have been lodged wholly in the national legislature,
or wholly in the State legislatures, or primarily in the latter
and ultimately in the former. The last mode has, with reason,
been preferred by the convention. They have submitted the
regulation of elections for the federal government, in the first
instance, to the local administrations; which, in ordinary
cases, and when no improper views prevail, may be both more
convenient and more satisfactory; but they have reserved to the
national authority a right to interpose, whenever extraordinary
circumstances might render that interposition necessary to its
safety. Nothing can be more evident, than that an exclusive
power of regulating elections for the national government, in the
hands of the State legislatures, would leave the existence of the
Union entirely at their mercy. They could at any moment
annihilate it, by neglecting to provide for the choice of persons
to administer its affairs. It is to little purpose to say, that
a neglect or omission of this kind would not be likely to take
place. The constitutional possibility of the thing, without an
equivalent for the risk, is an unanswerable objection. Nor has
any satisfactory reason been yet assigned for incurring that
risk. The extravagant surmises of a distempered jealousy can
never be dignified with that character. If we are in a humor to
presume abuses of power, it is as fair to presume them on the
part of the State governments as on the part of the general
government. And as it is more consonant to the rules of a just
theory, to trust the Union with the care of its own existence,
than to transfer that care to any other hands, if abuses of power
are to be hazarded on the one side or on the other, it is more
rational to hazard them where the power would naturally be
placed, than where it would unnaturally be placed. Suppose an
article had been introduced into the Constitution, empowering the
United States to regulate the elections for the particular
States, would any man have hesitated to condemn it, both as an
unwarrantable transposition of power, and as a premeditated
engine for the destruction of the State governments? The
violation of principle, in this case, would have required no
comment; and, to an unbiased observer, it will not be less
apparent in the project of subjecting the existence of the
national government, in a similar respect, to the pleasure of the
State governments. An impartial view of the matter cannot fail
to result in a conviction, that each, as far as possible, ought
to depend on itself for its own preservation. As an objection to
this position, it may be remarked that the constitution of the
national Senate would involve, in its full extent, the danger
which it is suggested might flow from an exclusive power in the
State legislatures to regulate the federal elections. It may be
alleged, that by declining the appointment of Senators, they
might at any time give a fatal blow to the Union; and from this
it may be inferred, that as its existence would be thus rendered
dependent upon them in so essential a point, there can be no
objection to intrusting them with it in the particular case under
consideration. The interest of each State, it may be added, to
maintain its representation in the national councils, would be a
complete security against an abuse of the trust. This argument,
though specious, will not, upon examination, be found solid. It
is certainly true that the State legislatures, by forbearing the
appointment of senators, may destroy the national government. But
it will not follow that, because they have a power to do this in
one instance, they ought to have it in every other. There are
cases in which the pernicious tendency of such a power may be far
more decisive, without any motive equally cogent with that which
must have regulated the conduct of the convention in respect to
the formation of the Senate, to recommend their admission into
the system. So far as that construction may expose the Union to
the possibility of injury from the State legislatures, it is an
evil; but it is an evil which could not have been avoided without
excluding the States, in their political capacities, wholly from
a place in the organization of the national government. If this
had been done, it would doubtless have been interpreted into an
entire dereliction of the federal principle; and would certainly
have deprived the State governments of that absolute safeguard
which they will enjoy under this provision. But however wise it
may have been to have submitted in this instance to an
inconvenience, for the attainment of a necessary advantage or a
greater good, no inference can be drawn from thence to favor an
accumulation of the evil, where no necessity urges, nor any
greater good invites. It may be easily discerned also that the
national government would run a much greater risk from a power in
the State legislatures over the elections of its House of
Representatives, than from their power of appointing the members
of its Senate. The senators are to be chosen for the period of
six years; there is to be a rotation, by which the seats of a
third part of them are to be vacated and replenished every two
years; and no State is to be entitled to more than two senators;
a quorum of the body is to consist of sixteen members. The joint
result of these circumstances would be, that a temporary
combination of a few States to intermit the appointment of
senators, could neither annul the existence nor impair the
activity of the body; and it is not from a general and permanent
combination of the States that we can have any thing to fear. The
first might proceed from sinister designs in the leading members
of a few of the State legislatures; the last would suppose a
fixed and rooted disaffection in the great body of the people,
which will either never exist at all, or will, in all
probability, proceed from an experience of the inaptitude of the
general government to the advancement of their happiness in which
event no good citizen could desire its continuance. But with
regard to the federal House of Representatives, there is intended
to be a general election of members once in two years. If the
State legislatures were to be invested with an exclusive power of
regulating these elections, every period of making them would be
a delicate crisis in the national situation, which might issue in
a dissolution of the Union, if the leaders of a few of the most
important States should have entered into a previous conspiracy
to prevent an election. I shall not deny, that there is a degree
of weight in the observation, that the interests of each State,
to be represented in the federal councils, will be a security
against the abuse of a power over its elections in the hands of
the State legislatures. But the security will not be considered
as complete, by those who attend to the force of an obvious
distinction between the interest of the people in the public
felicity, and the interest of their local rulers in the power and
consequence of their offices. The people of America may be
warmly attached to the government of the Union, at times when the
particular rulers of particular States, stimulated by the natural
rivalship of power, and by the hopes of personal aggrandizement,
and supported by a strong faction in each of those States, may be
in a very opposite temper. This diversity of sentiment between a
majority of the people, and the individuals who have the
greatest credit in their councils, is exemplified in some of the
States at the present moment, on the present question. The
scheme of separate confederacies, which will always nultiply the
chances of ambition, will be a never failing bait to all such
influential characters in the State administrations as are
capable of preferring their own emolument and advancement to the
public weal. With so effectual a weapon in their hands as the
exclusive power of regulating elections for the national
government, a combination of a few such men, in a few of the most
considerable States, where the temptation will always be the
strongest, might accomplish the destruction of the Union, by
seizing the opportunity of some casual dissatisfaction among the
people (and which perhaps they may themselves have excited), to
discontinue the choice of members for the federal House of
Representatives. It ought never to be forgotten, that a firm
union of this country, under an efficient government, will
probably be an increasing object of jealousy to more than one
nation of Europe; and that enterprises to subvert it will
sometimes originate in the intrigues of foreign powers, and will
seldom fail to be patronized and abetted by some of them. Its
preservation, therefore ought in no case that can be avoided, to
be committed to the guardianship of any but those whose situation
will uniformly beget an immediate interest in the faithful and
vigilant performance of the trust. PUBLIUS. Ist clause, 4th
section, of the Ist article. 


FEDERALIST No. 60

The Same Subject Continued
(Concerning the Power of Congress to Regulate the Election of
 Members)
From the New York Packet.
Tuesday, February 26, 1788.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
WE HAVE seen, that an uncontrollable power over the elections to
 the federal government could not, without hazard, be committed to
 the State legislatures. Let us now see, what would be the danger on
 the other side; that is, from confiding the ultimate right of
 regulating its own elections to the Union itself. It is not
 pretended, that this right would ever be used for the exclusion of
 any State from its share in the representation. The interest of all
 would, in this respect at least, be the security of all. But it is
 alleged, that it might be employed in such a manner as to promote
 the election of some favorite class of men in exclusion of others,
 by confining the places of election to particular districts, and
 rendering it impracticable to the citizens at large to partake in
 the choice. Of all chimerical suppositions, this seems to be the
 most chimerical. On the one hand, no rational calculation of
 probabilities would lead us to imagine that the disposition which a
 conduct so violent and extraordinary would imply, could ever find
 its way into the national councils; and on the other, it may be
 concluded with certainty, that if so improper a spirit should ever
 gain admittance into them, it would display itself in a form
 altogether different and far more decisive.
The improbability of the attempt may be satisfactorily inferred
 from this single reflection, that it could never be made without
 causing an immediate revolt of the great body of the people, headed
 and directed by the State governments. It is not difficult to
 conceive that this characteristic right of freedom may, in certain
 turbulent and factious seasons, be violated, in respect to a
 particular class of citizens, by a victorious and overbearing
 majority; but that so fundamental a privilege, in a country so
 situated and enlightened, should be invaded to the prejudice of the
 great mass of the people, by the deliberate policy of the
 government, without occasioning a popular revolution, is altogether
 inconceivable and incredible.
In addition to this general reflection, there are considerations
 of a more precise nature, which forbid all apprehension on the
 subject. The dissimilarity in the ingredients which will compose
 the national government, and Ustill more in the manner in which they
 will be brought into action in its various branches, must form a
 powerful obstacle to a concert of views in any partial scheme of
 elections. There is sufficient diversity in the state of property,
 in the genius, manners, and habits of the people of the different
 parts of the Union, to occasion a material diversity of disposition
 in their representatives towards the different ranks and conditions
 in society. And though an intimate intercourse under the same
 government will promote a gradual assimilation in some of these
 respects, yet there are causes, as well physical as moral, which
 may, in a greater or less degree, permanently nourish different
 propensities and inclinations in this respect. But the circumstance
 which will be likely to have the greatest influence in the matter,
 will be the dissimilar modes of constituting the several component
 parts of the government. The House of Representatives being to be
 elected immediately by the people, the Senate by the State
 legislatures, the President by electors chosen for that purpose by
 the people, there would be little probability of a common interest
 to cement these different branches in a predilection for any
 particular class of electors.
As to the Senate, it is impossible that any regulation of ``time
 and manner,'' which is all that is proposed to be submitted to the
 national government in respect to that body, can affect the spirit
 which will direct the choice of its members. The collective sense
 of the State legislatures can never be influenced by extraneous
 circumstances of that sort; a consideration which alone ought to
 satisfy us that the discrimination apprehended would never be
 attempted. For what inducement could the Senate have to concur in a
 preference in which itself would not be included? Or to what
 purpose would it be established, in reference to one branch of the
 legislature, if it could not be extended to the other? The
 composition of the one would in this case counteract that of the
 other. And we can never suppose that it would embrace the
 appointments to the Senate, unless we can at the same time suppose
 the voluntary co-operation of the State legislatures. If we make
 the latter supposition, it then becomes immaterial where the power
 in question is placed whether in their hands or in those of the
 Union.
But what is to be the object of this capricious partiality in
 the national councils? Is it to be exercised in a discrimination
 between the different departments of industry, or between the
 different kinds of property, or between the different degrees of
 property? Will it lean in favor of the landed interest, or the
 moneyed interest, or the mercantile interest, or the manufacturing
 interest? Or, to speak in the fashionable language of the
 adversaries to the Constitution, will it court the elevation of
 ``the wealthy and the well-born,'' to the exclusion and debasement
 of all the rest of the society?
If this partiality is to be exerted in favor of those who are
 concerned in any particular description of industry or property, I
 presume it will readily be admitted, that the competition for it
 will lie between landed men and merchants. And I scruple not to
 affirm, that it is infinitely less likely that either of them should
 gain an ascendant in the national councils, than that the one or the
 other of them should predominate in all the local councils. The
 inference will be, that a conduct tending to give an undue
 preference to either is much less to be dreaded from the former than
 from the latter.
The several States are in various degrees addicted to
 agriculture and commerce. In most, if not all of them, agriculture
 is predominant. In a few of them, however, commerce nearly divides
 its empire, and in most of them has a considerable share of
 influence. In proportion as either prevails, it will be conveyed
 into the national representation; and for the very reason, that
 this will be an emanation from a greater variety of interests, and
 in much more various proportions, than are to be found in any single
 State, it will be much less apt to espouse either of them with a
 decided partiality, than the representation of any single State.
In a country consisting chiefly of the cultivators of land,
 where the rules of an equal representation obtain, the landed
 interest must, upon the whole, preponderate in the government. As
 long as this interest prevails in most of the State legislatures, so
 long it must maintain a correspondent superiority in the national
 Senate, which will generally be a faithful copy of the majorities of
 those assemblies. It cannot therefore be presumed, that a sacrifice
 of the landed to the mercantile class will ever be a favorite object
 of this branch of the federal legislature. In applying thus
 particularly to the Senate a general observation suggested by the
 situation of the country, I am governed by the consideration, that
 the credulous votaries of State power cannot, upon their own
 principles, suspect, that the State legislatures would be warped
 from their duty by any external influence. But in reality the same
 situation must have the same effect, in the primative composition at
 least of the federal House of Representatives: an improper bias
 towards the mercantile class is as little to be expected from this
 quarter as from the other.
In order, perhaps, to give countenance to the objection at any
 rate, it may be asked, is there not danger of an opposite bias in
 the national government, which may dispose it to endeavor to secure
 a monopoly of the federal administration to the landed class? As
 there is little likelihood that the supposition of such a bias will
 have any terrors for those who would be immediately injured by it, a
 labored answer to this question will be dispensed with. It will be
 sufficient to remark, first, that for the reasons elsewhere
 assigned, it is less likely that any decided partiality should
 prevail in the councils of the Union than in those of any of its
 members. Secondly, that there would be no temptation to violate the
 Constitution in favor of the landed class, because that class would,
 in the natural course of things, enjoy as great a preponderancy as
 itself could desire. And thirdly, that men accustomed to
 investigate the sources of public prosperity upon a large scale,
 must be too well convinced of the utility of commerce, to be
 inclined to inflict upon it so deep a wound as would result from the
 entire exclusion of those who would best understand its interest
 from a share in the management of them. The importance of commerce,
 in the view of revenue alone, must effectually guard it against the
 enmity of a body which would be continually importuned in its favor,
 by the urgent calls of public necessity.
I the rather consult brevity in discussing the probability of a
 preference founded upon a discrimination between the different kinds
 of industry and property, because, as far as I understand the
 meaning of the objectors, they contemplate a discrimination of
 another kind. They appear to have in view, as the objects of the
 preference with which they endeavor to alarm us, those whom they
 designate by the description of ``the wealthy and the well-born.''
 These, it seems, are to be exalted to an odious pre-eminence over
 the rest of their fellow-citizens. At one time, however, their
 elevation is to be a necessary consequence of the smallness of the
 representative body; at another time it is to be effected by
 depriving the people at large of the opportunity of exercising their
 right of suffrage in the choice of that body.
But upon what principle is the discrimination of the places of
 election to be made, in order to answer the purpose of the meditated
 preference? Are ``the wealthy and the well-born,'' as they are
 called, confined to particular spots in the several States? Have
 they, by some miraculous instinct or foresight, set apart in each of
 them a common place of residence? Are they only to be met with in
 the towns or cities? Or are they, on the contrary, scattered over
 the face of the country as avarice or chance may have happened to
 cast their own lot or that of their predecessors? If the latter is
 the case, (as every intelligent man knows it to be,1) is it not
 evident that the policy of confining the places of election to
 particular districts would be as subversive of its own aim as it
 would be exceptionable on every other account? The truth is, that
 there is no method of securing to the rich the preference
 apprehended, but by prescribing qualifications of property either
 for those who may elect or be elected. But this forms no part of
 the power to be conferred upon the national government. Its
 authority would be expressly restricted to the regulation of the
 TIMES, the PLACES, the MANNER of elections. The qualifications of
 the persons who may choose or be chosen, as has been remarked upon
 other occasions, are defined and fixed in the Constitution, and are
 unalterable by the legislature.
Let it, however, be admitted, for argument sake, that the
 expedient suggested might be successful; and let it at the same
 time be equally taken for granted that all the scruples which a
 sense of duty or an apprehension of the danger of the experiment
 might inspire, were overcome in the breasts of the national rulers,
 still I imagine it will hardly be pretended that they could ever
 hope to carry such an enterprise into execution without the aid of a
 military force sufficient to subdue the resistance of the great body
 of the people. The improbability of the existence of a force equal
 to that object has been discussed and demonstrated in different
 parts of these papers; but that the futility of the objection under
 consideration may appear in the strongest light, it shall be
 conceded for a moment that such a force might exist, and the
 national government shall be supposed to be in the actual possession
 of it. What will be the conclusion? With a disposition to invade
 the essential rights of the community, and with the means of
 gratifying that disposition, is it presumable that the persons who
 were actuated by it would amuse themselves in the ridiculous task of
 fabricating election laws for securing a preference to a favorite
 class of men? Would they not be likely to prefer a conduct better
 adapted to their own immediate aggrandizement? Would they not
 rather boldly resolve to perpetuate themselves in office by one
 decisive act of usurpation, than to trust to precarious expedients
 which, in spite of all the precautions that might accompany them,
 might terminate in the dismission, disgrace, and ruin of their
 authors? Would they not fear that citizens, not less tenacious than
 conscious of their rights, would flock from the remote extremes of
 their respective States to the places of election, to voerthrow
 their tyrants, and to substitute men who would be disposed to avenge
 the violated majesty of the people?

FEDERALIST No. 61

The Same Subject Continued
(Concerning the Power of Congress to Regulate the Election of
 Members)
From the New York Packet.
Tuesday, February 26, 1788.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
THE more candid opposers of the provision respecting elections,
 contained in the plan of the convention, when pressed in argument,
 will sometimes concede the propriety of that provision; with this
 qualification, however, that it ought to have been accompanied with
 a declaration, that all elections should be had in the counties
 where the electors resided. This, say they, was a necessary
 precaution against an abuse of the power. A declaration of this
 nature would certainly have been harmless; so far as it would have
 had the effect of quieting apprehensions, it might not have been
 undesirable. But it would, in fact, have afforded little or no
 additional security against the danger apprehended; and the want of
 it will never be considered, by an impartial and judicious examiner,
 as a serious, still less as an insuperable, objection to the plan.
 The different views taken of the subject in the two preceding
 papers must be sufficient to satisfy all dispassionate and
 discerning men, that if the public liberty should ever be the victim
 of the ambition of the national rulers, the power under examination,
 at least, will be guiltless of the sacrifice.
If those who are inclined to consult their jealousy only, would
 exercise it in a careful inspection of the several State
 constitutions, they would find little less room for disquietude and
 alarm, from the latitude which most of them allow in respect to
 elections, than from the latitude which is proposed to be allowed to
 the national government in the same respect. A review of their
 situation, in this particular, would tend greatly to remove any ill
 impressions which may remain in regard to this matter. But as that
 view would lead into long and tedious details, I shall content
 myself with the single example of the State in which I write. The
 constitution of New York makes no other provision for LOCALITY of
 elections, than that the members of the Assembly shall be elected in
 the COUNTIES; those of the Senate, in the great districts into
 which the State is or may be divided: these at present are four in
 number, and comprehend each from two to six counties. It may
 readily be perceived that it would not be more difficult to the
 legislature of New York to defeat the suffrages of the citizens of
 New York, by confining elections to particular places, than for the
 legislature of the United States to defeat the suffrages of the
 citizens of the Union, by the like expedient. Suppose, for
 instance, the city of Albany was to be appointed the sole place of
 election for the county and district of which it is a part, would
 not the inhabitants of that city speedily become the only electors
 of the members both of the Senate and Assembly for that county and
 district? Can we imagine that the electors who reside in the remote
 subdivisions of the counties of Albany, Saratoga, Cambridge, etc.,
 or in any part of the county of Montgomery, would take the trouble
 to come to the city of Albany, to give their votes for members of
 the Assembly or Senate, sooner than they would repair to the city of
 New York, to participate in the choice of the members of the federal
 House of Representatives? The alarming indifference discoverable in
 the exercise of so invaluable a privilege under the existing laws,
 which afford every facility to it, furnishes a ready answer to this
 question. And, abstracted from any experience on the subject, we
 can be at no loss to determine, that when the place of election is
 at an INCONVENIENT DISTANCE from the elector, the effect upon his
 conduct will be the same whether that distance be twenty miles or
 twenty thousand miles. Hence it must appear, that objections to the
 particular modification of the federal power of regulating elections
 will, in substance, apply with equal force to the modification of
 the like power in the constitution of this State; and for this
 reason it will be impossible to acquit the one, and to condemn the
 other. A similar comparison would lead to the same conclusion in
 respect to the constitutions of most of the other States.
If it should be said that defects in the State constitutions
 furnish no apology for those which are to be found in the plan
 proposed, I answer, that as the former have never been thought
 chargeable with inattention to the security of liberty, where the
 imputations thrown on the latter can be shown to be applicable to
 them also, the presumption is that they are rather the cavilling
 refinements of a predetermined opposition, than the well-founded
 inferences of a candid research after truth. To those who are
 disposed to consider, as innocent omissions in the State
 constitutions, what they regard as unpardonable blemishes in the
 plan of the convention, nothing can be said; or at most, they can
 only be asked to assign some substantial reason why the
 representatives of the people in a single State should be more
 impregnable to the lust of power, or other sinister motives, than
 the representatives of the people of the United States? If they
 cannot do this, they ought at least to prove to us that it is easier
 to subvert the liberties of three millions of people, with the
 advantage of local governments to head their opposition, than of two
 hundred thousand people who are destitute of that advantage. And in
 relation to the point immediately under consideration, they ought to
 convince us that it is less probable that a predominant faction in a
 single State should, in order to maintain its superiority, incline
 to a preference of a particular class of electors, than that a
 similar spirit should take possession of the representatives of
 thirteen States, spread over a vast region, and in several respects
 distinguishable from each other by a diversity of local
 circumstances, prejudices, and interests.
Hitherto my observations have only aimed at a vindication of the
 provision in question, on the ground of theoretic propriety, on that
 of the danger of placing the power elsewhere, and on that of the
 safety of placing it in the manner proposed. But there remains to
 be mentioned a positive advantage which will result from this
 disposition, and which could not as well have been obtained from any
 other: I allude to the circumstance of uniformity in the time of
 elections for the federal House of Representatives. It is more than
 possible that this uniformity may be found by experience to be of
 great importance to the public welfare, both as a security against
 the perpetuation of the same spirit in the body, and as a cure for
 the diseases of faction. If each State may choose its own time of
 election, it is possible there may be at least as many different
 periods as there are months in the year. The times of election in
 the several States, as they are now established for local purposes,
 vary between extremes as wide as March and November. The
 consequence of this diversity would be that there could never happen
 a total dissolution or renovation of the body at one time. If an
 improper spirit of any kind should happen to prevail in it, that
 spirit would be apt to infuse itself into the new members, as they
 come forward in succession. The mass would be likely to remain
 nearly the same, assimilating constantly to itself its gradual
 accretions. There is a contagion in example which few men have
 sufficient force of mind to resist. I am inclined to think that
 treble the duration in office, with the condition of a total
 dissolution of the body at the same time, might be less formidable
 to liberty than one third of that duration subject to gradual and
 successive alterations.
Uniformity in the time of elections seems not less requisite for
 executing the idea of a regular rotation in the Senate, and for
 conveniently assembling the legislature at a stated period in each
 year.
It may be asked, Why, then, could not a time have been fixed in
 the Constitution? As the most zealous adversaries of the plan of
 the convention in this State are, in general, not less zealous
 admirers of the constitution of the State, the question may be
 retorted, and it may be asked, Why was not a time for the like
 purpose fixed in the constitution of this State? No better answer
 can be given than that it was a matter which might safely be
 entrusted to legislative discretion; and that if a time had been
 appointed, it might, upon experiment, have been found less
 convenient than some other time. The same answer may be given to
 the question put on the other side. And it may be added that the
 supposed danger of a gradual change being merely speculative, it
 would have been hardly advisable upon that speculation to establish,
 as a fundamental point, what would deprive several States of the
 convenience of having the elections for their own governments and
 for the national government at the same epochs.

FEDERALIST No. 62

The Senate
For the Independent Journal.

HAMILTON OR MADISON

To the People of the State of New York:
HAVING examined the constitution of the House of
 Representatives, and answered such of the objections against it as
 seemed to merit notice, I enter next on the examination of the
 Senate.
The heads into which this member of the government may be
 considered are: I. The qualification of senators; II. The
 appointment of them by the State legislatures; III. The equality of
 representation in the Senate; IV. The number of senators, and the
 term for which they are to be elected; V. The powers vested in the
 Senate.
I. The qualifications proposed for senators, as distinguished
 from those of representatives, consist in a more advanced age and a
 longer period of citizenship. A senator must be thirty years of age
 at least; as a representative must be twenty-five. And the former
 must have been a citizen nine years; as seven years are required
 for the latter. The propriety of these distinctions is explained by
 the nature of the senatorial trust, which, requiring greater extent
 of information and tability of character, requires at the same time
 that the senator should have reached a period of life most likely to
 supply these advantages; and which, participating immediately in
 transactions with foreign nations, ought to be exercised by none who
 are not thoroughly weaned from the prepossessions and habits
 incident to foreign birth and education. The term of nine years
 appears to be a prudent mediocrity between a total exclusion of
 adopted citizens, whose merits and talents may claim a share in the
 public confidence, and an indiscriminate and hasty admission of
 them, which might create a channel for foreign influence on the
 national councils.
II. It is equally unnecessary to dilate on the appointment of
 senators by the State legislatures. Among the various modes which
 might have been devised for constituting this branch of the
 government, that which has been proposed by the convention is
 probably the most congenial with the public opinion. It is
 recommended by the double advantage of favoring a select
 appointment, and of giving to the State governments such an agency
 in the formation of the federal government as must secure the
 authority of the former, and may form a convenient link between the
 two systems.
III. The equality of representation in the Senate is another
 point, which, being evidently the result of compromise between the
 opposite pretensions of the large and the small States, does not
 call for much discussion. If indeed it be right, that among a
 people thoroughly incorporated into one nation, every district ought
 to have a PROPORTIONAL share in the government, and that among
 independent and sovereign States, bound together by a simple league,
 the parties, however unequal in size, ought to have an EQUAL share
 in the common councils, it does not appear to be without some reason
 that in a compound republic, partaking both of the national and
 federal character, the government ought to be founded on a mixture
 of the principles of proportional and equal representation. But it
 is superfluous to try, by the standard of theory, a part of the
 Constitution which is allowed on all hands to be the result, not of
 theory, but ``of a spirit of amity, and that mutual deference and
 concession which the peculiarity of our political situation rendered
 indispensable.'' A common government, with powers equal to its
 objects, is called for by the voice, and still more loudly by the
 political situation, of America. A government founded on principles
 more consonant to the wishes of the larger States, is not likely to
 be obtained from the smaller States. The only option, then, for the
 former, lies between the proposed government and a government still
 more objectionable. Under this alternative, the advice of prudence
 must be to embrace the lesser evil; and, instead of indulging a
 fruitless anticipation of the possible mischiefs which may ensue, to
 contemplate rather the advantageous consequences which may qualify
 the sacrifice.
In this spirit it may be remarked, that the equal vote allowed
 to each State is at once a constitutional recognition of the portion
 of sovereignty remaining in the individual States, and an instrument
 for preserving that residuary sovereignty. So far the equality
 ought to be no less acceptable to the large than to the small
 States; since they are not less solicitous to guard, by every
 possible expedient, against an improper consolidation of the States
 into one simple republic.
Another advantage accruing from this ingredient in the
 constitution of the Senate is, the additional impediment it must
 prove against improper acts of legislation. No law or resolution
 can now be passed without the concurrence, first, of a majority of
 the people, and then, of a majority of the States. It must be
 acknowledged that this complicated check on legislation may in some
 instances be injurious as well as beneficial; and that the peculiar
 defense which it involves in favor of the smaller States, would be
 more rational, if any interests common to them, and distinct from
 those of the other States, would otherwise be exposed to peculiar
 danger. But as the larger States will always be able, by their
 power over the supplies, to defeat unreasonable exertions of this
 prerogative of the lesser States, and as the faculty and excess of
 law-making seem to be the diseases to which our governments are most
 liable, it is not impossible that this part of the Constitution may
 be more convenient in practice than it appears to many in
 contemplation.
IV. The number of senators, and the duration of their
 appointment, come next to be considered. In order to form an
 accurate judgment on both of these points, it will be proper to
 inquire into the purposes which are to be answered by a senate; and
 in order to ascertain these, it will be necessary to review the
 inconveniences which a republic must suffer from the want of such an
 institution.
First. It is a misfortune incident to republican
 government, though in a less degree than to other governments, that
 those who administer it may forget their obligations to their
 constituents, and prove unfaithful to their important trust. In
 this point of view, a senate, as a second branch of the legislative
 assembly, distinct from, and dividing the power with, a first, must
 be in all cases a salutary check on the government. It doubles the
 security to the people, by requiring the concurrence of two distinct
 bodies in schemes of usurpation or perfidy, where the ambition or
 corruption of one would otherwise be sufficient. This is a
 precaution founded on such clear principles, and now so well
 understood in the United States, that it would be more than
 superfluous to enlarge on it. I will barely remark, that as the
 improbability of sinister combinations will be in proportion to the
 dissimilarity in the genius of the two bodies, it must be politic to
 distinguish them from each other by every circumstance which will
 consist with a due harmony in all proper measures, and with the
 genuine principles of republican government.
Secondly. The necessity of a senate is not less indicated
 by the propensity of all single and numerous assemblies to yield to
 the impulse of sudden and violent passions, and to be seduced by
 factious leaders into intemperate and pernicious resolutions.
 Examples on this subject might be cited without number; and from
 proceedings within the United States, as well as from the history of
 other nations. But a position that will not be contradicted, need
 not be proved. All that need be remarked is, that a body which is
 to correct this infirmity ought itself to be free from it, and
 consequently ought to be less numerous. It ought, moreover, to
 possess great firmness, and consequently ought to hold its authority
 by a tenure of considerable duration.
Thirdly. Another defect to be supplied by a senate lies in
 a want of due acquaintance with the objects and principles of
 legislation. It is not possible that an assembly of men called for
 the most part from pursuits of a private nature, continued in
 appointment for a short time, and led by no permanent motive to
 devote the intervals of public occupation to a study of the laws,
 the affairs, and the comprehensive interests of their country,
 should, if left wholly to themselves, escape a variety of important
 errors in the exercise of their legislative trust. It may be
 affirmed, on the best grounds, that no small share of the present
 embarrassments of America is to be charged on the blunders of our
 governments; and that these have proceeded from the heads rather
 than the hearts of most of the authors of them. What indeed are all
 the repealing, explaining, and amending laws, which fill and
 disgrace our voluminous codes, but so many monuments of deficient
 wisdom; so many impeachments exhibited by each succeeding against
 each preceding session; so many admonitions to the people, of the
 value of those aids which may be expected from a well-constituted
 senate?
A good government implies two things: first, fidelity to the
 object of government, which is the happiness of the people;
 secondly, a knowledge of the means by which that object can be best
 attained. Some governments are deficient in both these qualities;
 most governments are deficient in the first. I scruple not to
 assert, that in American governments too little attention has been
 paid to the last. The federal Constitution avoids this error; and
 what merits particular notice, it provides for the last in a mode
 which increases the security for the first.
Fourthly. The mutability in the public councils arising
 from a rapid succession of new members, however qualified they may
 be, points out, in the strongest manner, the necessity of some
 stable institution in the government. Every new election in the
 States is found to change one half of the representatives. From
 this change of men must proceed a change of opinions; and from a
 change of opinions, a change of measures. But a continual change
 even of good measures is inconsistent with every rule of prudence
 and every prospect of success. The remark is verified in private
 life, and becomes more just, as well as more important, in national
 transactions.
To trace the mischievous effects of a mutable government would
 fill a volume. I will hint a few only, each of which will be
 perceived to be a source of innumerable others.
In the first place, it forfeits the respect and confidence of
 other nations, and all the advantages connected with national
 character. An individual who is observed to be inconstant to his
 plans, or perhaps to carry on his affairs without any plan at all,
 is marked at once, by all prudent people, as a speedy victim to his
 own unsteadiness and folly. His more friendly neighbors may pity
 him, but all will decline to connect their fortunes with his; and
 not a few will seize the opportunity of making their fortunes out of
 his. One nation is to another what one individual is to another;
 with this melancholy distinction perhaps, that the former, with
 fewer of the benevolent emotions than the latter, are under fewer
 restraints also from taking undue advantage from the indiscretions
 of each other. Every nation, consequently, whose affairs betray a
 want of wisdom and stability, may calculate on every loss which can
 be sustained from the more systematic policy of their wiser
 neighbors. But the best instruction on this subject is unhappily
 conveyed to America by the example of her own situation. She finds
 that she is held in no respect by her friends; that she is the
 derision of her enemies; and that she is a prey to every nation
 which has an interest in speculating on her fluctuating councils and
 embarrassed affairs.
The internal effects of a mutable policy are still more
 calamitous. It poisons the blessing of liberty itself. It will be
 of little avail to the people, that the laws are made by men of
 their own choice, if the laws be so voluminous that they cannot be
 read, or so incoherent that they cannot be understood; if they be
 repealed or revised before they are promulgated, or undergo such
 incessant changes that no man, who knows what the law is to-day, can
 guess what it will be to-morrow. Law is defined to be a rule of
 action; but how can that be a rule, which is little known, and less
 fixed?
Another effect of public instability is the unreasonable
 advantage it gives to the sagacious, the enterprising, and the
 moneyed few over the industrious and uniformed mass of the people.
 Every new regulation concerning commerce or revenue, or in any way
 affecting the value of the different species of property, presents a
 new harvest to those who watch the change, and can trace its
 consequences; a harvest, reared not by themselves, but by the toils
 and cares of the great body of their fellow-citizens. This is a
 state of things in which it may be said with some truth that laws
 are made for the FEW, not for the MANY.
In another point of view, great injury results from an unstable
 government. The want of confidence in the public councils damps
 every useful undertaking, the success and profit of which may depend
 on a continuance of existing arrangements. What prudent merchant
 will hazard his fortunes in any new branch of commerce when he knows
 not but that his plans may be rendered unlawful before they can be
 executed? What farmer or manufacturer will lay himself out for the
 encouragement given to any particular cultivation or establishment,
 when he can have no assurance that his preparatory labors and
 advances will not render him a victim to an inconstant government?
 In a word, no great improvement or laudable enterprise can go
 forward which requires the auspices of a steady system of national
 policy.
But the most deplorable effect of all is that diminution of
 attachment and reverence which steals into the hearts of the people,
 towards a political system which betrays so many marks of infirmity,
 and disappoints so many of their flattering hopes. No government,
 any more than an individual, will long be respected without being
 truly respectable; nor be truly respectable, without possessing a
 certain portion of order and stability.
PUBLIUS.


FEDERALIST. No. 63

The Senate Continued
For the Independent Journal.

HAMILTON OR MADISON

To the People of the State of New York:
A FIFTH desideratum, illustrating the utility of a senate, is
 the want of a due sense of national character. Without a select and
 stable member of the government, the esteem of foreign powers will
 not only be forfeited by an unenlightened and variable policy,
 proceeding from the causes already mentioned, but the national
 councils will not possess that sensibility to the opinion of the
 world, which is perhaps not less necessary in order to merit, than
 it is to obtain, its respect and confidence.
An attention to the judgment of other nations is important to
 every government for two reasons: the one is, that, independently
 of the merits of any particular plan or measure, it is desirable, on
 various accounts, that it should appear to other nations as the
 offspring of a wise and honorable policy; the second is, that in
 doubtful cases, particularly where the national councils may be
 warped by some strong passion or momentary interest, the presumed or
 known opinion of the impartial world may be the best guide that can
 be followed. What has not America lost by her want of character
 with foreign nations; and how many errors and follies would she not
 have avoided, if the justice and propriety of her measures had, in
 every instance, been previously tried by the light in which they
 would probably appear to the unbiased part of mankind?
Yet however requisite a sense of national character may be, it
 is evident that it can never be sufficiently possessed by a numerous
 and changeable body. It can only be found in a number so small that
 a sensible degree of the praise and blame of public measures may be
 the portion of each individual; or in an assembly so durably
 invested with public trust, that the pride and consequence of its
 members may be sensibly incorporated with the reputation and
 prosperity of the community. The half-yearly representatives of
 Rhode Island would probably have been little affected in their
 deliberations on the iniquitous measures of that State, by arguments
 drawn from the light in which such measures would be viewed by
 foreign nations, or even by the sister States; whilst it can
 scarcely be doubted that if the concurrence of a select and stable
 body had been necessary, a regard to national character alone would
 have prevented the calamities under which that misguided people is
 now laboring.
I add, as a SIXTH defect the want, in some important cases, of a
 due responsibility in the government to the people, arising from
 that frequency of elections which in other cases produces this
 responsibility. This remark will, perhaps, appear not only new, but
 paradoxical. It must nevertheless be acknowledged, when explained,
 to be as undeniable as it is important.
Responsibility, in order to be reasonable, must be limited to
 objects within the power of the responsible party, and in order to
 be effectual, must relate to operations of that power, of which a
 ready and proper judgment can be formed by the constituents. The
 objects of government may be divided into two general classes: the
 one depending on measures which have singly an immediate and
 sensible operation; the other depending on a succession of
 well-chosen and well-connected measures, which have a gradual and
 perhaps unobserved operation. The importance of the latter
 description to the collective and permanent welfare of every
 country, needs no explanation. And yet it is evident that an
 assembly elected for so short a term as to be unable to provide more
 than one or two links in a chain of measures, on which the general
 welfare may essentially depend, ought not to be answerable for the
 final result, any more than a steward or tenant, engaged for one
 year, could be justly made to answer for places or improvements
 which could not be accomplished in less than half a dozen years.
 Nor is it possible for the people to estimate the SHARE of
 influence which their annual assemblies may respectively have on
 events resulting from the mixed transactions of several years. It
 is sufficiently difficult to preserve a personal responsibility in
 the members of a NUMEROUS body, for such acts of the body as have an
 immediate, detached, and palpable operation on its constituents.
The proper remedy for this defect must be an additional body in
 the legislative department, which, having sufficient permanency to
 provide for such objects as require a continued attention, and a
 train of measures, may be justly and effectually answerable for the
 attainment of those objects.
Thus far I have considered the circumstances which point out the
 necessity of a well-constructed Senate only as they relate to the
 representatives of the people. To a people as little blinded by
 prejudice or corrupted by flattery as those whom I address, I shall
 not scruple to add, that such an institution may be sometimes
 necessary as a defense to the people against their own temporary
 errors and delusions. As the cool and deliberate sense of the
 community ought, in all governments, and actually will, in all free
 governments, ultimately prevail over the views of its rulers; so
 there are particular moments in public affairs when the people,
 stimulated by some irregular passion, or some illicit advantage, or
 misled by the artful misrepresentations of interested men, may call
 for measures which they themselves will afterwards be the most ready
 to lament and condemn. In these critical moments, how salutary will
 be the interference of some temperate and respectable body of
 citizens, in order to check the misguided career, and to suspend the
 blow meditated by the people against themselves, until reason,
 justice, and truth can regain their authority over the public mind?
 What bitter anguish would not the people of Athens have often
 escaped if their government had contained so provident a safeguard
 against the tyranny of their own passions? Popular liberty might
 then have escaped the indelible reproach of decreeing to the same
 citizens the hemlock on one day and statues on the next.
It may be suggested, that a people spread over an extensive
 region cannot, like the crowded inhabitants of a small district, be
 subject to the infection of violent passions, or to the danger of
 combining in pursuit of unjust measures. I am far from denying that
 this is a distinction of peculiar importance. I have, on the
 contrary, endeavored in a former paper to show, that it is one of
 the principal recommendations of a confederated republic. At the
 same time, this advantage ought not to be considered as superseding
 the use of auxiliary precautions. It may even be remarked, that the
 same extended situation, which will exempt the people of America
 from some of the dangers incident to lesser republics, will expose
 them to the inconveniency of remaining for a longer time under the
 influence of those misrepresentations which the combined industry of
 interested men may succeed in distributing among them.
It adds no small weight to all these considerations, to
 recollect that history informs us of no long-lived republic which
 had not a senate. Sparta, Rome, and Carthage are, in fact, the only
 states to whom that character can be applied. In each of the two
 first there was a senate for life. The constitution of the senate
 in the last is less known. Circumstantial evidence makes it
 probable that it was not different in this particular from the two
 others. It is at least certain, that it had some quality or other
 which rendered it an anchor against popular fluctuations; and that
 a smaller council, drawn out of the senate, was appointed not only
 for life, but filled up vacancies itself. These examples, though as
 unfit for the imitation, as they are repugnant to the genius, of
 America, are, notwithstanding, when compared with the fugitive and
 turbulent existence of other ancient republics, very instructive
 proofs of the necessity of some institution that will blend
 stability with liberty. I am not unaware of the circumstances which
 distinguish the American from other popular governments, as well
 ancient as modern; and which render extreme circumspection
 necessary, in reasoning from the one case to the other. But after
 allowing due weight to this consideration, it may still be
 maintained, that there are many points of similitude which render
 these examples not unworthy of our attention. Many of the defects,
 as we have seen, which can only be supplied by a senatorial
 institution, are common to a numerous assembly frequently elected by
 the people, and to the people themselves. There are others peculiar
 to the former, which require the control of such an institution.
 The people can never wilfully betray their own interests; but they
 may possibly be betrayed by the representatives of the people; and
 the danger will be evidently greater where the whole legislative
 trust is lodged in the hands of one body of men, than where the
 concurrence of separate and dissimilar bodies is required in every
 public act.
The difference most relied on, between the American and other
 republics, consists in the principle of representation; which is
 the pivot on which the former move, and which is supposed to have
 been unknown to the latter, or at least to the ancient part of them.
 The use which has been made of this difference, in reasonings
 contained in former papers, will have shown that I am disposed
 neither to deny its existence nor to undervalue its importance. I
 feel the less restraint, therefore, in observing, that the position
 concerning the ignorance of the ancient governments on the subject
 of representation, is by no means precisely true in the latitude
 commonly given to it. Without entering into a disquisition which
 here would be misplaced, I will refer to a few known facts, in
 support of what I advance.
In the most pure democracies of Greece, many of the executive
 functions were performed, not by the people themselves, but by
 officers elected by the people, and REPRESENTING the people in their
 EXECUTIVE capacity.
Prior to the reform of Solon, Athens was governed by nine
 Archons, annually ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE AT LARGE. The degree of
 power delegated to them seems to be left in great obscurity.
 Subsequent to that period, we find an assembly, first of four, and
 afterwards of six hundred members, annually ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE;
 and PARTIALLY representing them in their LEGISLATIVE capacity,
 since they were not only associated with the people in the function
 of making laws, but had the exclusive right of originating
 legislative propositions to the people. The senate of Carthage,
 also, whatever might be its power, or the duration of its
 appointment, appears to have been ELECTIVE by the suffrages of the
 people. Similar instances might be traced in most, if not all the
 popular governments of antiquity.
Lastly, in Sparta we meet with the Ephori, and in Rome with the
 Tribunes; two bodies, small indeed in numbers, but annually ELECTED
 BY THE WHOLE BODY OF THE PEOPLE, and considered as the
 REPRESENTATIVES of the people, almost in their PLENIPOTENTIARY
 capacity. The Cosmi of Crete were also annually ELECTED BY THE
 PEOPLE, and have been considered by some authors as an institution
 analogous to those of Sparta and Rome, with this difference only,
 that in the election of that representative body the right of
 suffrage was communicated to a part only of the people.
From these facts, to which many others might be added, it is
 clear that the principle of representation was neither unknown to
 the ancients nor wholly overlooked in their political constitutions.
 The true distinction between these and the American governments,
 lies IN THE TOTAL EXCLUSION OF THE PEOPLE, IN THEIR COLLECTIVE
 CAPACITY, from any share in the LATTER, and not in the TOTAL
 EXCLUSION OF THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE from the
 administration of the FORMER. The distinction, however, thus
 qualified, must be admitted to leave a most advantageous superiority
 in favor of the United States. But to insure to this advantage its
 full effect, we must be careful not to separate it from the other
 advantage, of an extensive territory. For it cannot be believed,
 that any form of representative government could have succeeded
 within the narrow limits occupied by the democracies of Greece.
In answer to all these arguments, suggested by reason,
 illustrated by examples, and enforced by our own experience, the
 jealous adversary of the Constitution will probably content himself
 with repeating, that a senate appointed not immediately by the
 people, and for the term of six years, must gradually acquire a
 dangerous pre-eminence in the government, and finally transform it
 into a tyrannical aristocracy.
To this general answer, the general reply ought to be
 sufficient, that liberty may be endangered by the abuses of liberty
 as well as by the abuses of power; that there are numerous
 instances of the former as well as of the latter; and that the
 former, rather than the latter, are apparently most to be
 apprehended by the United States. But a more particular reply may
 be given.
Before such a revolution can be effected, the Senate, it is to
 be observed, must in the first place corrupt itself; must next
 corrupt the State legislatures; must then corrupt the House of
 Representatives; and must finally corrupt the people at large. It
 is evident that the Senate must be first corrupted before it can
 attempt an establishment of tyranny. Without corrupting the State
 legislatures, it cannot prosecute the attempt, because the
 periodical change of members would otherwise regenerate the whole
 body. Without exerting the means of corruption with equal success
 on the House of Representatives, the opposition of that coequal
 branch of the government would inevitably defeat the attempt; and
 without corrupting the people themselves, a succession of new
 representatives would speedily restore all things to their pristine
 order. Is there any man who can seriously persuade himself that the
 proposed Senate can, by any possible means within the compass of
 human address, arrive at the object of a lawless ambition, through
 all these obstructions?
If reason condemns the suspicion, the same sentence is
 pronounced by experience. The constitution of Maryland furnishes
 the most apposite example. The Senate of that State is elected, as
 the federal Senate will be, indirectly by the people, and for a term
 less by one year only than the federal Senate. It is distinguished,
 also, by the remarkable prerogative of filling up its own vacancies
 within the term of its appointment, and, at the same time, is not
 under the control of any such rotation as is provided for the
 federal Senate. There are some other lesser distinctions, which
 would expose the former to colorable objections, that do not lie
 against the latter. If the federal Senate, therefore, really
 contained the danger which has been so loudly proclaimed, some
 symptoms at least of a like danger ought by this time to have been
 betrayed by the Senate of Maryland, but no such symptoms have
 appeared. On the contrary, the jealousies at first entertained by
 men of the same description with those who view with terror the
 correspondent part of the federal Constitution, have been gradually
 extinguished by the progress of the experiment; and the Maryland
 constitution is daily deriving, from the salutary operation of this
 part of it, a reputation in which it will probably not be rivalled
 by that of any State in the Union.
But if any thing could silence the jealousies on this subject,
 it ought to be the British example. The Senate there instead of
 being elected for a term of six years, and of being unconfined to
 particular families or fortunes, is an hereditary assembly of
 opulent nobles. The House of Representatives, instead of being
 elected for two years, and by the whole body of the people, is
 elected for seven years, and, in very great proportion, by a very
 small proportion of the people. Here, unquestionably, ought to be
 seen in full display the aristocratic usurpations and tyranny which
 are at some future period to be exemplified in the United States.
 Unfortunately, however, for the anti-federal argument, the British
 history informs us that this hereditary assembly has not been able
 to defend itself against the continual encroachments of the House of
 Representatives; and that it no sooner lost the support of the
 monarch, than it was actually crushed by the weight of the popular
 branch.
As far as antiquity can instruct us on this subject, its
 examples support the reasoning which we have employed. In Sparta,
 the Ephori, the annual representatives of the people, were found an
 overmatch for the senate for life, continually gained on its
 authority and finally drew all power into their own hands. The
 Tribunes of Rome, who were the representatives of the people,
 prevailed, it is well known, in almost every contest with the senate
 for life, and in the end gained the most complete triumph over it.
 The fact is the more remarkable, as unanimity was required in every
 act of the Tribunes, even after their number was augmented to ten.
 It proves the irresistible force possessed by that branch of a free
 government, which has the people on its side. To these examples
 might be added that of Carthage, whose senate, according to the
 testimony of Polybius, instead of drawing all power into its vortex,
 had, at the commencement of the second Punic War, lost almost the
 whole of its original portion.
Besides the conclusive evidence resulting from this assemblage
 of facts, that the federal Senate will never be able to transform
 itself, by gradual usurpations, into an independent and aristocratic
 body, we are warranted in believing, that if such a revolution
 should ever happen from causes which the foresight of man cannot
 guard against, the House of Representatives, with the people on
 their side, will at all times be able to bring back the Constitution
 to its primitive form and principles. Against the force of the
 immediate representatives of the people, nothing will be able to
 maintain even the constitutional authority of the Senate, but such a
 display of enlightened policy, and attachment to the public good, as
 will divide with that branch of the legislature the affections and
 support of the entire body of the people themselves.
PUBLIUS.


FEDERALIST No. 64

The Powers of the Senate
From the New York Packet.
Friday, March 7, 1788.

JAY

To the People of the State of New York:
IT IS a just and not a new observation, that enemies to
 particular persons, and opponents to particular measures, seldom
 confine their censures to such things only in either as are worthy
 of blame. Unless on this principle, it is difficult to explain the
 motives of their conduct, who condemn the proposed Constitution in
 the aggregate, and treat with severity some of the most
 unexceptionable articles in it.
The second section gives power to the President, ``BY AND WITH
 THE ADVICE AND CONSENT OF THE SENATE, TO MAKE TREATIES, PROVIDED TWO
 THIRDS OF THE SENATORS PRESENT CONCUR.''
The power of making treaties is an important one, especially as
 it relates to war, peace, and commerce; and it should not be
 delegated but in such a mode, and with such precautions, as will
 afford the highest security that it will be exercised by men the
 best qualified for the purpose, and in the manner most conducive to
 the public good. The convention appears to have been attentive to
 both these points: they have directed the President to be chosen by
 select bodies of electors, to be deputed by the people for that
 express purpose; and they have committed the appointment of
 senators to the State legislatures. This mode has, in such cases,
 vastly the advantage of elections by the people in their collective
 capacity, where the activity of party zeal, taking the advantage of
 the supineness, the ignorance, and the hopes and fears of the unwary
 and interested, often places men in office by the votes of a small
 proportion of the electors.
As the select assemblies for choosing the President, as well as
 the State legislatures who appoint the senators, will in general be
 composed of the most enlightened and respectable citizens, there is
 reason to presume that their attention and their votes will be
 directed to those men only who have become the most distinguished by
 their abilities and virtue, and in whom the people perceive just
 grounds for confidence. The Constitution manifests very particular
 attention to this object. By excluding men under thirty-five from
 the first office, and those under thirty from the second, it
 confines the electors to men of whom the people have had time to
 form a judgment, and with respect to whom they will not be liable to
 be deceived by those brilliant appearances of genius and patriotism,
 which, like transient meteors, sometimes mislead as well as dazzle.
 If the observation be well founded, that wise kings will always be
 served by able ministers, it is fair to argue, that as an assembly
 of select electors possess, in a greater degree than kings, the
 means of extensive and accurate information relative to men and
 characters, so will their appointments bear at least equal marks of
 discretion and discernment. The inference which naturally results
 from these considerations is this, that the President and senators
 so chosen will always be of the number of those who best understand
 our national interests, whether considered in relation to the
 several States or to foreign nations, who are best able to promote
 those interests, and whose reputation for integrity inspires and
 merits confidence. With such men the power of making treaties may
 be safely lodged.
Although the absolute necessity of system, in the conduct of any
 business, is universally known and acknowledged, yet the high
 importance of it in national affairs has not yet become sufficiently
 impressed on the public mind. They who wish to commit the power
 under consideration to a popular assembly, composed of members
 constantly coming and going in quick succession, seem not to
 recollect that such a body must necessarily be inadequate to the
 attainment of those great objects, which require to be steadily
 contemplated in all their relations and circumstances, and which can
 only be approached and achieved by measures which not only talents,
 but also exact information, and often much time, are necessary to
 concert and to execute. It was wise, therefore, in the convention
 to provide, not only that the power of making treaties should be
 committed to able and honest men, but also that they should continue
 in place a sufficient time to become perfectly acquainted with our
 national concerns, and to form and introduce a a system for the
 management of them. The duration prescribed is such as will give
 them an opportunity of greatly extending their political
 information, and of rendering their accumulating experience more and
 more beneficial to their country. Nor has the convention discovered
 less prudence in providing for the frequent elections of senators in
 such a way as to obviate the inconvenience of periodically
 transferring those great affairs entirely to new men; for by
 leaving a considerable residue of the old ones in place, uniformity
 and order, as well as a constant succession of official information
 will be preserved.
There are a few who will not admit that the affairs of trade and
 navigation should be regulated by a system cautiously formed and
 steadily pursued; and that both our treaties and our laws should
 correspond with and be made to promote it. It is of much
 consequence that this correspondence and conformity be carefully
 maintained; and they who assent to the truth of this position will
 see and confess that it is well provided for by making concurrence
 of the Senate necessary both to treaties and to laws.
It seldom happens in the negotiation of treaties, of whatever
 nature, but that perfect SECRECY and immediate DESPATCH are
 sometimes requisite. These are cases where the most useful
 intelligence may be obtained, if the persons possessing it can be
 relieved from apprehensions of discovery. Those apprehensions will
 operate on those persons whether they are actuated by mercenary or
 friendly motives; and there doubtless are many of both
 descriptions, who would rely on the secrecy of the President, but
 who would not confide in that of the Senate, and still less in that
 of a large popular Assembly. The convention have done well,
 therefore, in so disposing of the power of making treaties, that
 although the President must, in forming them, act by the advice and
 consent of the Senate, yet he will be able to manage the business of
 intelligence in such a manner as prudence may suggest.
They who have turned their attention to the affairs of men, must
 have perceived that there are tides in them; tides very irregular
 in their duration, strength, and direction, and seldom found to run
 twice exactly in the same manner or measure. To discern and to
 profit by these tides in national affairs is the business of those
 who preside over them; and they who have had much experience on
 this head inform us, that there frequently are occasions when days,
 nay, even when hours, are precious. The loss of a battle, the death
 of a prince, the removal of a minister, or other circumstances
 intervening to change the present posture and aspect of affairs, may
 turn the most favorable tide into a course opposite to our wishes.
 As in the field, so in the cabinet, there are moments to be seized
 as they pass, and they who preside in either should be left in
 capacity to improve them. So often and so essentially have we
 heretofore suffered from the want of secrecy and despatch, that the
 Constitution would have been inexcusably defective, if no attention
 had been paid to those objects. Those matters which in negotiations
 usually require the most secrecy and the most despatch, are those
 preparatory and auxiliary measures which are not otherwise important
 in a national view, than as they tend to facilitate the attainment
 of the objects of the negotiation. For these, the President will
 find no difficulty to provide; and should any circumstance occur
 which requires the advice and consent of the Senate, he may at any
 time convene them. Thus we see that the Constitution provides that
 our negotiations for treaties shall have every advantage which can
 be derived from talents, information, integrity, and deliberate
 investigations, on the one hand, and from secrecy and despatch on
 the other.
But to this plan, as to most others that have ever appeared,
 objections are contrived and urged.
Some are displeased with it, not on account of any errors or
 defects in it, but because, as the treaties, when made, are to have
 the force of laws, they should be made only by men invested with
 legislative authority. These gentlemen seem not to consider that
 the judgments of our courts, and the commissions constitutionally
 given by our governor, are as valid and as binding on all persons
 whom they concern, as the laws passed by our legislature. All
 constitutional acts of power, whether in the executive or in the
 judicial department, have as much legal validity and obligation as
 if they proceeded from the legislature; and therefore, whatever
 name be given to the power of making treaties, or however obligatory
 they may be when made, certain it is, that the people may, with much
 propriety, commit the power to a distinct body from the legislature,
 the executive, or the judicial. It surely does not follow, that
 because they have given the power of making laws to the legislature,
 that therefore they should likewise give them the power to do every
 other act of sovereignty by which the citizens are to be bound and
 affected.
Others, though content that treaties should be made in the mode
 proposed, are averse to their being the SUPREME laws of the land.
 They insist, and profess to believe, that treaties like acts of
 assembly, should be repealable at pleasure. This idea seems to be
 new and peculiar to this country, but new errors, as well as new
 truths, often appear. These gentlemen would do well to reflect that
 a treaty is only another name for a bargain, and that it would be
 impossible to find a nation who would make any bargain with us,
 which should be binding on them ABSOLUTELY, but on us only so long
 and so far as we may think proper to be bound by it. They who make
 laws may, without doubt, amend or repeal them; and it will not be
 disputed that they who make treaties may alter or cancel them; but
 still let us not forget that treaties are made, not by only one of
 the contracting parties, but by both; and consequently, that as the
 consent of both was essential to their formation at first, so must
 it ever afterwards be to alter or cancel them. The proposed
 Constitution, therefore, has not in the least extended the
 obligation of treaties. They are just as binding, and just as far
 beyond the lawful reach of legislative acts now, as they will be at
 any future period, or under any form of government.
However useful jealousy may be in republics, yet when like bile
 in the natural, it abounds too much in the body politic, the eyes of
 both become very liable to be deceived by the delusive appearances
 which that malady casts on surrounding objects. From this cause,
 probably, proceed the fears and apprehensions of some, that the
 President and Senate may make treaties without an equal eye to the
 interests of all the States. Others suspect that two thirds will
 oppress the remaining third, and ask whether those gentlemen are
 made sufficiently responsible for their conduct; whether, if they
 act corruptly, they can be punished; and if they make
 disadvantageous treaties, how are we to get rid of those treaties?
As all the States are equally represented in the Senate, and by
 men the most able and the most willing to promote the interests of
 their constituents, they will all have an equal degree of influence
 in that body, especially while they continue to be careful in
 appointing proper persons, and to insist on their punctual
 attendance. In proportion as the United States assume a national
 form and a national character, so will the good of the whole be more
 and more an object of attention, and the government must be a weak
 one indeed, if it should forget that the good of the whole can only
 be promoted by advancing the good of each of the parts or members
 which compose the whole. It will not be in the power of the
 President and Senate to make any treaties by which they and their
 families and estates will not be equally bound and affected with the
 rest of the community; and, having no private interests distinct
 from that of the nation, they will be under no temptations to
 neglect the latter.
As to corruption, the case is not supposable. He must either
 have been very unfortunate in his intercourse with the world, or
 possess a heart very susceptible of such impressions, who can think
 it probable that the President and two thirds of the Senate will
 ever be capable of such unworthy conduct. The idea is too gross and
 too invidious to be entertained. But in such a case, if it should
 ever happen, the treaty so obtained from us would, like all other
 fraudulent contracts, be null and void by the law of nations.
With respect to their responsibility, it is difficult to
 conceive how it could be increased. Every consideration that can
 influence the human mind, such as honor, oaths, reputations,
 conscience, the love of country, and family affections and
 attachments, afford security for their fidelity. In short, as the
 Constitution has taken the utmost care that they shall be men of
 talents and integrity, we have reason to be persuaded that the
 treaties they make will be as advantageous as, all circumstances
 considered, could be made; and so far as the fear of punishment and
 disgrace can operate, that motive to good behavior is amply afforded
 by the article on the subject of impeachments.
PUBLIUS.


FEDERALIST No. 65

The Powers of the Senate Continued
From the New York Packet.
Friday, March 7, 1788.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
THE remaining powers which the plan of the convention allots to
 the Senate, in a distinct capacity, are comprised in their
 participation with the executive in the appointment to offices, and
 in their judicial character as a court for the trial of impeachments.
 As in the business of appointments the executive will be the
 principal agent, the provisions relating to it will most properly be
 discussed in the examination of that department. We will,
 therefore, conclude this head with a view of the judicial character
 of the Senate.
A well-constituted court for the trial of impeachments is an
 object not more to be desired than difficult to be obtained in a
 government wholly elective. The subjects of its jurisdiction are
 those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or,
 in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust.
 They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be
 denominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done
 immediately to the society itself. The prosecution of them, for
 this reason, will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole
 community, and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or
 inimical to the accused. In many cases it will connect itself with
 the pre-existing factions, and will enlist all their animosities,
 partialities, influence, and interest on one side or on the other;
 and in such cases there will always be the greatest danger that the
 decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of
 parties, than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt.
The delicacy and magnitude of a trust which so deeply concerns
 the political reputation and existence of every man engaged in the
 administration of public affairs, speak for themselves. The
 difficulty of placing it rightly, in a government resting entirely
 on the basis of periodical elections, will as readily be perceived,
 when it is considered that the most conspicuous characters in it
 will, from that circumstance, be too often the leaders or the tools
 of the most cunning or the most numerous faction, and on this
 account, can hardly be expected to possess the requisite neutrality
 towards those whose conduct may be the subject of scrutiny.
The convention, it appears, thought the Senate the most fit
 depositary of this important trust. Those who can best discern the
 intrinsic difficulty of the thing, will be least hasty in condemning
 that opinion, and will be most inclined to allow due weight to the
 arguments which may be supposed to have produced it.
What, it may be asked, is the true spirit of the institution
 itself? Is it not designed as a method of NATIONAL INQUEST into the
 conduct of public men? If this be the design of it, who can so
 properly be the inquisitors for the nation as the representatives of
 the nation themselves? It is not disputed that the power of
 originating the inquiry, or, in other words, of preferring the
 impeachment, ought to be lodged in the hands of one branch of the
 legislative body. Will not the reasons which indicate the propriety
 of this arrangement strongly plead for an admission of the other
 branch of that body to a share of the inquiry? The model from which
 the idea of this institution has been borrowed, pointed out that
 course to the convention. In Great Britain it is the province of
 the House of Commons to prefer the impeachment, and of the House of
 Lords to decide upon it. Several of the State constitutions have
 followed the example. As well the latter, as the former, seem to
 have regarded the practice of impeachments as a bridle in the hands
 of the legislative body upon the executive servants of the
 government. Is not this the true light in which it ought to be
 regarded?
Where else than in the Senate could have been found a tribunal
 sufficiently dignified, or sufficiently independent? What other
 body would be likely to feel CONFIDENCE ENOUGH IN ITS OWN SITUATION,
 to preserve, unawed and uninfluenced, the necessary impartiality
 between an INDIVIDUAL accused, and the REPRESENTATIVES OF THE
 PEOPLE, HIS ACCUSERS?
Could the Supreme Court have been relied upon as answering this
 description? It is much to be doubted, whether the members of that
 tribunal would at all times be endowed with so eminent a portion of
 fortitude, as would be called for in the execution of so difficult a
 task; and it is still more to be doubted, whether they would
 possess the degree of credit and authority, which might, on certain
 occasions, be indispensable towards reconciling the people to a
 decision that should happen to clash with an accusation brought by
 their immediate representatives. A deficiency in the first, would
 be fatal to the accused; in the last, dangerous to the public
 tranquillity. The hazard in both these respects, could only be
 avoided, if at all, by rendering that tribunal more numerous than
 would consist with a reasonable attention to economy. The necessity
 of a numerous court for the trial of impeachments, is equally
 dictated by the nature of the proceeding. This can never be tied
 down by such strict rules, either in the delineation of the offense
 by the prosecutors, or in the construction of it by the judges, as
 in common cases serve to limit the discretion of courts in favor of
 personal security. There will be no jury to stand between the
 judges who are to pronounce the sentence of the law, and the party
 who is to receive or suffer it. The awful discretion which a court
 of impeachments must necessarily have, to doom to honor or to infamy
 the most confidential and the most distinguished characters of the
 community, forbids the commitment of the trust to a small number of
 persons.
These considerations seem alone sufficient to authorize a
 conclusion, that the Supreme Court would have been an improper
 substitute for the Senate, as a court of impeachments. There
 remains a further consideration, which will not a little strengthen
 this conclusion. It is this: The punishment which may be the
 consequence of conviction upon impeachment, is not to terminate the
 chastisement of the offender. After having been sentenced to a
 prepetual ostracism from the esteem and confidence, and honors and
 emoluments of his country, he will still be liable to prosecution
 and punishment in the ordinary course of law. Would it be proper
 that the persons who had disposed of his fame, and his most valuable
 rights as a citizen in one trial, should, in another trial, for the
 same offense, be also the disposers of his life and his fortune?
 Would there not be the greatest reason to apprehend, that error, in
 the first sentence, would be the parent of error in the second
 sentence? That the strong bias of one decision would be apt to
 overrule the influence of any new lights which might be brought to
 vary the complexion of another decision? Those who know anything of
 human nature, will not hesitate to answer these questions in the
 affirmative; and will be at no loss to perceive, that by making the
 same persons judges in both cases, those who might happen to be the
 objects of prosecution would, in a great measure, be deprived of the
 double security intended them by a double trial. The loss of life
 and estate would often be virtually included in a sentence which, in
 its terms, imported nothing more than dismission from a present, and
 disqualification for a future, office. It may be said, that the
 intervention of a jury, in the second instance, would obviate the
 danger. But juries are frequently influenced by the opinions of
 judges. They are sometimes induced to find special verdicts, which
 refer the main question to the decision of the court. Who would be
 willing to stake his life and his estate upon the verdict of a jury
 acting under the auspices of judges who had predetermined his guilt?
Would it have been an improvement of the plan, to have united
 the Supreme Court with the Senate, in the formation of the court of
 impeachments? This union would certainly have been attended with
 several advantages; but would they not have been overbalanced by
 the signal disadvantage, already stated, arising from the agency of
 the same judges in the double prosecution to which the offender
 would be liable? To a certain extent, the benefits of that union
 will be obtained from making the chief justice of the Supreme Court
 the president of the court of impeachments, as is proposed to be
 done in the plan of the convention; while the inconveniences of an
 entire incorporation of the former into the latter will be
 substantially avoided. This was perhaps the prudent mean. I
 forbear to remark upon the additional pretext for clamor against the
 judiciary, which so considerable an augmentation of its authority
 would have afforded.
Would it have been desirable to have composed the court for the
 trial of impeachments, of persons wholly distinct from the other
 departments of the government? There are weighty arguments, as well
 against, as in favor of, such a plan. To some minds it will not
 appear a trivial objection, that it could tend to increase the
 complexity of the political machine, and to add a new spring to the
 government, the utility of which would at best be questionable. But
 an objection which will not be thought by any unworthy of attention,
 is this: a court formed upon such a plan, would either be attended
 with a heavy expense, or might in practice be subject to a variety
 of casualties and inconveniences. It must either consist of
 permanent officers, stationary at the seat of government, and of
 course entitled to fixed and regular stipends, or of certain
 officers of the State governments to be called upon whenever an
 impeachment was actually depending. It will not be easy to imagine
 any third mode materially different, which could rationally be
 proposed. As the court, for reasons already given, ought to be
 numerous, the first scheme will be reprobated by every man who can
 compare the extent of the public wants with the means of supplying
 them. The second will be espoused with caution by those who will
 seriously consider the difficulty of collecting men dispersed over
 the whole Union; the injury to the innocent, from the
 procrastinated determination of the charges which might be brought
 against them; the advantage to the guilty, from the opportunities
 which delay would afford to intrigue and corruption; and in some
 cases the detriment to the State, from the prolonged inaction of men
 whose firm and faithful execution of their duty might have exposed
 them to the persecution of an intemperate or designing majority in
 the House of Representatives. Though this latter supposition may
 seem harsh, and might not be likely often to be verified, yet it
 ought not to be forgotten that the demon of faction will, at certain
 seasons, extend his sceptre over all numerous bodies of men.
But though one or the other of the substitutes which have been
 examined, or some other that might be devised, should be thought
 preferable to the plan in this respect, reported by the convention,
 it will not follow that the Constitution ought for this reason to be
 rejected. If mankind were to resolve to agree in no institution of
 government, until every part of it had been adjusted to the most
 exact standard of perfection, society would soon become a general
 scene of anarchy, and the world a desert. Where is the standard of
 perfection to be found? Who will undertake to unite the discordant
 opinions of a whole commuity, in the same judgment of it; and to
 prevail upon one conceited projector to renounce his INFALLIBLE
 criterion for the FALLIBLE criterion of his more CONCEITED NEIGHBOR?
 To answer the purpose of the adversaries of the Constitution, they
 ought to prove, not merely that particular provisions in it are not
 the best which might have been imagined, but that the plan upon the
 whole is bad and pernicious.
PUBLIUS.


FEDERALIST No. 66

Objections to the Power of the Senate To Set as a Court for
 Impeachments Further Considered
From the New York Packet.
Tuesday, March 11, 1788.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
A REVIEW of the principal objections that have appeared against
 the proposed court for the trial of impeachments, will not
 improbably eradicate the remains of any unfavorable impressions
 which may still exist in regard to this matter.
The FIRST of these objections is, that the provision in question
 confounds legislative and judiciary authorities in the same body, in
 violation of that important and wellestablished maxim which requires
 a separation between the different departments of power. The true
 meaning of this maxim has been discussed and ascertained in another
 place, and has been shown to be entirely compatible with a partial
 intermixture of those departments for special purposes, preserving
 them, in the main, distinct and unconnected. This partial
 intermixture is even, in some cases, not only proper but necessary
 to the mutual defense of the several members of the government
 against each other. An absolute or qualified negative in the
 executive upon the acts of the legislative body, is admitted, by the
 ablest adepts in political science, to be an indispensable barrier
 against the encroachments of the latter upon the former. And it
 may, perhaps, with no less reason be contended, that the powers
 relating to impeachments are, as before intimated, an essential
 check in the hands of that body upon the encroachments of the
 executive. The division of them between the two branches of the
 legislature, assigning to one the right of accusing, to the other
 the right of judging, avoids the inconvenience of making the same
 persons both accusers and judges; and guards against the danger of
 persecution, from the prevalency of a factious spirit in either of
 those branches. As the concurrence of two thirds of the Senate will
 be requisite to a condemnation, the security to innocence, from this
 additional circumstance, will be as complete as itself can desire.
It is curious to observe, with what vehemence this part of the
 plan is assailed, on the principle here taken notice of, by men who
 profess to admire, without exception, the constitution of this
 State; while that constitution makes the Senate, together with the
 chancellor and judges of the Supreme Court, not only a court of
 impeachments, but the highest judicatory in the State, in all
 causes, civil and criminal. The proportion, in point of numbers, of
 the chancellor and judges to the senators, is so inconsiderable,
 that the judiciary authority of New York, in the last resort, may,
 with truth, be said to reside in its Senate. If the plan of the
 convention be, in this respect, chargeable with a departure from the
 celebrated maxim which has been so often mentioned, and seems to be
 so little understood, how much more culpable must be the
 constitution of New York?1
A SECOND objection to the Senate, as a court of impeachments,
 is, that it contributes to an undue accumulation of power in that
 body, tending to give to the government a countenance too
 aristocratic. The Senate, it is observed, is to have concurrent
 authority with the Executive in the formation of treaties and in the
 appointment to offices: if, say the objectors, to these
 prerogatives is added that of deciding in all cases of impeachment,
 it will give a decided predominancy to senatorial influence. To an
 objection so little precise in itself, it is not easy to find a very
 precise answer. Where is the measure or criterion to which we can
 appeal, for determining what will give the Senate too much, too
 little, or barely the proper degree of influence? Will it not be
 more safe, as well as more simple, to dismiss such vague and
 uncertain calculations, to examine each power by itself, and to
 decide, on general principles, where it may be deposited with most
 advantage and least inconvenience?
If we take this course, it will lead to a more intelligible, if
 not to a more certain result. The disposition of the power of
 making treaties, which has obtained in the plan of the convention,
 will, then, if I mistake not, appear to be fully justified by the
 considerations stated in a former number, and by others which will
 occur under the next head of our inquiries. The expediency of the
 junction of the Senate with the Executive, in the power of
 appointing to offices, will, I trust, be placed in a light not less
 satisfactory, in the disquisitions under the same head. And I
 flatter myself the observations in my last paper must have gone no
 inconsiderable way towards proving that it was not easy, if
 practicable, to find a more fit receptacle for the power of
 determining impeachments, than that which has been chosen. If this
 be truly the case, the hypothetical dread of the too great weight of
 the Senate ought to be discarded from our reasonings.
But this hypothesis, such as it is, has already been refuted in
 the remarks applied to the duration in office prescribed for the
 senators. It was by them shown, as well on the credit of historical
 examples, as from the reason of the thing, that the most POPULAR
 branch of every government, partaking of the republican genius, by
 being generally the favorite of the people, will be as generally a
 full match, if not an overmatch, for every other member of the
 Government.
But independent of this most active and operative principle, to
 secure the equilibrium of the national House of Representatives, the
 plan of the convention has provided in its favor several important
 counterpoises to the additional authorities to be conferred upon the
 Senate. The exclusive privilege of originating money bills will
 belong to the House of Representatives. The same house will possess
 the sole right of instituting impeachments: is not this a complete
 counterbalance to that of determining them? The same house will be
 the umpire in all elections of the President, which do not unite the
 suffrages of a majority of the whole number of electors; a case
 which it cannot be doubted will sometimes, if not frequently, happen. 
 The constant possibility of the thing must be a fruitful source of
 influence to that body. The more it is contemplated, the more
 important will appear this ultimate though contingent power, of
 deciding the competitions of the most illustrious citizens of the
 Union, for the first office in it. It would not perhaps be rash to
 predict, that as a mean of influence it will be found to outweigh
 all the peculiar attributes of the Senate.
A THIRD objection to the Senate as a court of impeachments, is
 drawn from the agency they are to have in the appointments to office. 
 It is imagined that they would be too indulgent judges of the
 conduct of men, in whose official creation they had participated.
 The principle of this objection would condemn a practice, which is
 to be seen in all the State governments, if not in all the
 governments with which we are acquainted: I mean that of rendering
 those who hold offices during pleasure, dependent on the pleasure of
 those who appoint them. With equal plausibility might it be alleged
 in this case, that the favoritism of the latter would always be an
 asylum for the misbehavior of the former. But that practice, in
 contradiction to this principle, proceeds upon the presumption, that
 the responsibility of those who appoint, for the fitness and
 competency of the persons on whom they bestow their choice, and the
 interest they will have in the respectable and prosperous
 administration of affairs, will inspire a sufficient disposition to
 dismiss from a share in it all such who, by their conduct, shall
 have proved themselves unworthy of the confidence reposed in them.
 Though facts may not always correspond with this presumption, yet
 if it be, in the main, just, it must destroy the supposition that
 the Senate, who will merely sanction the choice of the Executive,
 should feel a bias, towards the objects of that choice, strong
 enough to blind them to the evidences of guilt so extraordinary, as
 to have induced the representatives of the nation to become its
 accusers.
If any further arguments were necessary to evince the
 improbability of such a bias, it might be found in the nature of the
 agency of the Senate in the business of appointments.
It will be the office of the President to NOMINATE, and, with
 the advice and consent of the Senate, to APPOINT. There will, of
 course, be no exertion of CHOICE on the part of the Senate. They
 may defeat one choice of the Executive, and oblige him to make
 another; but they cannot themselves CHOOSE, they can only ratify or
 reject the choice of the President. They might even entertain a
 preference to some other person, at the very moment they were
 assenting to the one proposed, because there might be no positive
 ground of opposition to him; and they could not be sure, if they
 withheld their assent, that the subsequent nomination would fall
 upon their own favorite, or upon any other person in their
 estimation more meritorious than the one rejected. Thus it could
 hardly happen, that the majority of the Senate would feel any other
 complacency towards the object of an appointment than such as the
 appearances of merit might inspire, and the proofs of the want of it
 destroy.
A FOURTH objection to the Senate in the capacity of a court of
 impeachments, is derived from its union with the Executive in the
 power of making treaties. This, it has been said, would constitute
 the senators their own judges, in every case of a corrupt or
 perfidious execution of that trust. After having combined with the
 Executive in betraying the interests of the nation in a ruinous
 treaty, what prospect, it is asked, would there be of their being
 made to suffer the punishment they would deserve, when they were
 themselves to decide upon the accusation brought against them for
 the treachery of which they have been guilty?
This objection has been circulated with more earnestness and
 with greater show of reason than any other which has appeared
 against this part of the plan; and yet I am deceived if it does not
 rest upon an erroneous foundation.
The security essentially intended by the Constitution against
 corruption and treachery in the formation of treaties, is to be
 sought for in the numbers and characters of those who are to make
 them. The JOINT AGENCY of the Chief Magistrate of the Union, and of
 two thirds of the members of a body selected by the collective
 wisdom of the legislatures of the several States, is designed to be
 the pledge for the fidelity of the national councils in this
 particular. The convention might with propriety have meditated the
 punishment of the Executive, for a deviation from the instructions
 of the Senate, or a want of integrity in the conduct of the
 negotiations committed to him; they might also have had in view the
 punishment of a few leading individuals in the Senate, who should
 have prostituted their influence in that body as the mercenary
 instruments of foreign corruption: but they could not, with more or
 with equal propriety, have contemplated the impeachment and
 punishment of two thirds of the Senate, consenting to an improper
 treaty, than of a majority of that or of the other branch of the
 national legislature, consenting to a pernicious or unconstitutional
 law, a principle which, I believe, has never been admitted into any
 government. How, in fact, could a majority in the House of
 Representatives impeach themselves? Not better, it is evident, than
 two thirds of the Senate might try themselves. And yet what reason
 is there, that a majority of the House of Representatives,
 sacrificing the interests of the society by an unjust and tyrannical
 act of legislation, should escape with impunity, more than two
 thirds of the Senate, sacrificing the same interests in an injurious
 treaty with a foreign power? The truth is, that in all such cases
 it is essential to the freedom and to the necessary independence of
 the deliberations of the body, that the members of it should be
 exempt from punishment for acts done in a collective capacity; and
 the security to the society must depend on the care which is taken
 to confide the trust to proper hands, to make it their interest to
 execute it with fidelity, and to make it as difficult as possible
 for them to combine in any interest opposite to that of the public
 good.
So far as might concern the misbehavior of the Executive in
 perverting the instructions or contravening the views of the Senate,
 we need not be apprehensive of the want of a disposition in that
 body to punish the abuse of their confidence or to vindicate their
 own authority. We may thus far count upon their pride, if not upon
 their virtue. And so far even as might concern the corruption of
 leading members, by whose arts and influence the majority may have
 been inveigled into measures odious to the community, if the proofs
 of that corruption should be satisfactory, the usual propensity of
 human nature will warrant us in concluding that there would be
 commonly no defect of inclination in the body to divert the public
 resentment from themselves by a ready sacrifice of the authors of
 their mismanagement and disgrace.

The Executive Department
From the New York Packet.
Tuesday, March 11, 1788.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
THE constitution of the executive department of the proposed
 government, claims next our attention.
There is hardly any part of the system which could have been
 atten ed with greater difficulty in the arrangement of it than this;
 and there is, perhaps, none which has been inveighed against with
 less candor or criticised with less judgment.
Here the writers against the Constitution seem to have taken
 pains to signalize their talent of misrepresentation. Calculating
 upon the aversion of the people to monarchy, they have endeavored to
 enlist all their jealousies and apprehensions in opposition to the
 intended President of the United States; not merely as the embryo,
 but as the full-grown progeny, of that detested parent. To
 establish the pretended affinity, they have not scrupled to draw
 resources even from the regions of fiction. The authorities of a
 magistrate, in few instances greater, in some instances less, than
 those of a governor of New York, have been magnified into more than
 royal prerogatives. He has been decorated with attributes superior
 in dignity and splendor to those of a king of Great Britain. He has
 been shown to us with the diadem sparkling on his brow and the
 imperial purple flowing in his train. He has been seated on a
 throne surrounded with minions and mistresses, giving audience to
 the envoys of foreign potentates, in all the supercilious pomp of
 majesty. The images of Asiatic despotism and voluptuousness have
 scarcely been wanting to crown the exaggerated scene. We have been
 taught to tremble at the terrific visages of murdering janizaries,
 and to blush at the unveiled mysteries of a future seraglio.
Attempts so extravagant as these to disfigure or, it might
 rather be said, to metamorphose the object, render it necessary to
 take an accurate view of its real nature and form: in order as well
 to ascertain its true aspect and genuine appearance, as to unmask
 the disingenuity and expose the fallacy of the counterfeit
 resemblances which have been so insidiously, as well as
 industriously, propagated.
In the execution of this task, there is no man who would not
 find it an arduous effort either to behold with moderation, or to
 treat with seriousness, the devices, not less weak than wicked,
 which have been contrived to pervert the public opinion in relation
 to the subject. They so far exceed the usual though unjustifiable
 licenses of party artifice, that even in a disposition the most
 candid and tolerant, they must force the sentiments which favor an
 indulgent construction of the conduct of political adversaries to
 give place to a voluntary and unreserved indignation. It is
 impossible not to bestow the imputation of deliberate imposture and
 deception upon the gross pretense of a similitude between a king of
 Great Britain and a magistrate of the character marked out for that
 of the President of the United States. It is still more impossible
 to withhold that imputation from the rash and barefaced expedients
 which have been employed to give success to the attempted imposition.
In one instance, which I cite as a sample of the general spirit,
 the temerity has proceeded so far as to ascribe to the President of
 the United States a power which by the instrument reported is
 EXPRESSLY allotted to the Executives of the individual States. I
 mean the power of filling casual vacancies in the Senate.
This bold experiment upon the discernment of his countrymen has
 been hazarded by a writer who (whatever may be his real merit) has
 had no inconsiderable share in the applauses of his party1; and
 who, upon this false and unfounded suggestion, has built a series of
 observations equally false and unfounded. Let him now be confronted
 with the evidence of the fact, and let him, if he be able, justify
 or extenuate the shameful outrage he has offered to the dictates of
 truth and to the rules of fair dealing.
The second clause of the second section of the second article
 empowers the President of the United States ``to nominate, and by
 and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint
 ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the
 Supreme Court, and all other OFFICERS of United States whose
 appointments are NOT in the Constitution OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR, and
 WHICH SHALL BE ESTABLISHED BY LAW.'' Immediately after this clause
 follows another in these words: ``The President shall have power to
 fill up ?? VACANCIES that may happen DURING THE RECESS OF THE
 SENATE, by granting commissions which shall EXPIRE AT THE END OF
 THEIR NEXT SESSION.'' It is from this last provision that the
 pretended power of the President to fill vacancies in the Senate has
 been deduced. A slight attention to the connection of the clauses,
 and to the obvious meaning of the terms, will satisfy us that the
 deduction is not even colorable.
The first of these two clauses, it is clear, only provides a
 mode for appointing such officers, ``whose appointments are NOT
 OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR in the Constitution, and which SHALL BE
 ESTABLISHED BY LAW''; of course it cannot extend to the
 appointments of senators, whose appointments are OTHERWISE PROVIDED
 FOR in the Constitution2, and who are ESTABLISHED BY THE
 CONSTITUTION, and will not require a future establishment by law.
 This position will hardly be contested.
The last of these two clauses, it is equally clear, cannot be
 understood to comprehend the power of filling vacancies in the
 Senate, for the following reasons:  First. The relation in
 which that clause stands to the other, which declares the general
 mode of appointing officers of the United States, denotes it to be
 nothing more than a supplement to the other, for the purpose of
 establishing an auxiliary method of appointment, in cases to which
 the general method was inadequate. The ordinary power of
 appointment is confined to the President and Senate JOINTLY, and can
 therefore only be exercised during the session of the Senate; but
 as it would have been improper to oblige this body to be continually
 in session for the appointment of officers and as vacancies might
 happen IN THEIR RECESS, which it might be necessary for the public
 service to fill without delay, the succeeding clause is evidently
 intended to authorize the President, SINGLY, to make temporary
 appointments ``during the recess of the Senate, by granting
 commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session.''
 Secondly. If this clause is to be considered as supplementary
 to the one which precedes, the VACANCIES of which it speaks must be
 construed to relate to the ``officers'' described in the preceding
 one; and this, we have seen, excludes from its description the
 members of the Senate. Thirdly. The time within which the
 power is to operate, ``during the recess of the Senate,'' and the
 duration of the appointments, ``to the end of the next session'' of
 that body, conspire to elucidate the sense of the provision, which,
 if it had been intended to comprehend senators, would naturally have
 referred the temporary power of filling vacancies to the recess of
 the State legislatures, who are to make the permanent appointments,
 and not to the recess of the national Senate, who are to have no
 concern in those appointments; and would have extended the duration
 in office of the temporary senators to the next session of the
 legislature of the State, in whose representation the vacancies had
 happened, instead of making it to expire at the end of the ensuing
 session of the national Senate. The circumstances of the body
 authorized to make the permanent appointments would, of course, have
 governed the modification of a power which related to the temporary
 appointments; and as the national Senate is the body, whose
 situation is alone contemplated in the clause upon which the
 suggestion under examination has been founded, the vacancies to
 which it alludes can only be deemed to respect those officers in
 whose appointment that body has a concurrent agency with the
 President. But lastly, the first and second clauses of the
 third section of the first article, not only obviate all possibility
 of doubt, but destroy the pretext of misconception. The former
 provides, that ``the Senate of the United States shall be composed
 of two Senators from each State, chosen BY THE LEGISLATURE THEREOF
 for six years''; and the latter directs, that, ``if vacancies in
 that body should happen by resignation or otherwise, DURING THE
 RECESS OF THE LEGISLATURE OF ANY STATE, the Executive THEREOF may
 make temporary appointments until the NEXT MEETING OF THE
 LEGISLATURE, which shall then fill such vacancies.'' Here is an
 express power given, in clear and unambiguous terms, to the State
 Executives, to fill casual vacancies in the Senate, by temporary
 appointments; which not only invalidates the supposition, that the
 clause before considered could have been intended to confer that
 power upon the President of the United States, but proves that this
 supposition, destitute as it is even of the merit of plausibility,
 must have originated in an intention to deceive the people, too
 palpable to be obscured by sophistry, too atrocious to be palliated
 by hypocrisy.
I have taken the pains to select this instance of
 misrepresentation, and to place it in a clear and strong light, as
 an unequivocal proof of the unwarrantable arts which are practiced
 to prevent a fair and impartial judgment of the real merits of the
 Constitution submitted to the consideration of the people. Nor have
 I scrupled, in so flagrant a case, to allow myself a severity of
 animadversion little congenial with the general spirit of these
 papers. I hesitate not to submit it to the decision of any candid
 and honest adversary of the proposed government, whether language
 can furnish epithets of too much asperity, for so shameless and so
 prostitute an attempt to impose on the citizens of America.

The Mode of Electing the President
From the New York Packet.
Friday, March 14, 1788.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
THE mode of appointment of the Chief Magistrate of the United
 States is almost the only part of the system, of any consequence,
 which has escaped without severe censure, or which has received the
 slightest mark of approbation from its opponents. The most
 plausible of these, who has appeared in print, has even deigned to
 admit that the election of the President is pretty well
 guarded.1 I venture somewhat further, and hesitate not to
 affirm, that if the manner of it be not perfect, it is at least
 excellent. It unites in an eminent degree all the advantages, the
 union of which was to be wished for.
It was desirable that the sense of the people should operate in
 the choice of the person to whom so important a trust was to be
 confided. This end will be answered by committing the right of
 making it, not to any preestablished body, but to men chosen by the
 people for the special purpose, and at the particular conjuncture.
It was equally desirable, that the immediate election should be
 made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the
 station, and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation,
 and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements
 which were proper to govern their choice. A small number of
 persons, selected by their fellow-citizens from the general mass,
 will be most likely to possess the information and discernment
 requisite to such complicated investigations.
It was also peculiarly desirable to afford as little opportunity
 as possible to tumult and disorder. This evil was not least to be
 dreaded in the election of a magistrate, who was to have so
 important an agency in the administration of the government as the
 President of the United States. But the precautions which have been
 so happily concerted in the system under consideration, promise an
 effectual security against this mischief. The choice of SEVERAL, to
 form an intermediate body of electors, will be much less apt to
 convulse the community with any extraordinary or violent movements,
 than the choice of ONE who was himself to be the final object of the
 public wishes. And as the electors, chosen in each State, are to
 assemble and vote in the State in which they are chosen, this
 detached and divided situation will expose them much less to heats
 and ferments, which might be communicated from them to the people,
 than if they were all to be convened at one time, in one place.
Nothing was more to be desired than that every practicable
 obstacle should be opposed to cabal, intrigue, and corruption.
 These most deadly adversaries of republican government might
 naturally have been expected to make their approaches from more than
 one querter, but chiefly from the desire in foreign powers to gain
 an improper ascendant in our councils. How could they better
 gratify this, than by raising a creature of their own to the chief
 magistracy of the Union? But the convention have guarded against
 all danger of this sort, with the most provident and judicious
 attention. They have not made the appointment of the President to
 depend on any preexisting bodies of men, who might be tampered with
 beforehand to prostitute their votes; but they have referred it in
 the first instance to an immediate act of the people of America, to
 be exerted in the choice of persons for the temporary and sole
 purpose of making the appointment. And they have excluded from
 eligibility to this trust, all those who from situation might be
 suspected of too great devotion to the President in office. No
 senator, representative, or other person holding a place of trust or
 profit under the United States, can be of the numbers of the
 electors. Thus without corrupting the body of the people, the
 immediate agents in the election will at least enter upon the task
 free from any sinister bias. Their transient existence, and their
 detached situation, already taken notice of, afford a satisfactory
 prospect of their continuing so, to the conclusion of it. The
 business of corruption, when it is to embrace so considerable a
 number of men, requires time as well as means. Nor would it be
 found easy suddenly to embark them, dispersed as they would be over
 thirteen States, in any combinations founded upon motives, which
 though they could not properly be denominated corrupt, might yet be
 of a nature to mislead them from their duty.
Another and no less important desideratum was, that the
 Executive should be independent for his continuance in office on all
 but the people themselves. He might otherwise be tempted to
 sacrifice his duty to his complaisance for those whose favor was
 necessary to the duration of his official consequence. This
 advantage will also be secured, by making his re-election to depend
 on a special body of representatives, deputed by the society for the
 single purpose of making the important choice.
All these advantages will happily combine in the plan devised by
 the convention; which is, that the people of each State shall
 choose a number of persons as electors, equal to the number of
 senators and representatives of such State in the national
 government, who shall assemble within the State, and vote for some
 fit person as President. Their votes, thus given, are to be
 transmitted to the seat of the national government, and the person
 who may happen to have a majority of the whole number of votes will
 be the President. But as a majority of the votes might not always
 happen to centre in one man, and as it might be unsafe to permit
 less than a majority to be conclusive, it is provided that, in such
 a contingency, the House of Representatives shall select out of the
 candidates who shall have the five highest number of votes, the man
 who in their opinion may be best qualified for the office.
The process of election affords a moral certainty, that the
 office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not
 in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications.
 Talents for low intrigue, and the little arts of popularity, may
 alone suffice to elevate a man to the first honors in a single
 State; but it will require other talents, and a different kind of
 merit, to establish him in the esteem and confidence of the whole
 Union, or of so considerable a portion of it as would be necessary
 to make him a successful candidate for the distinguished office of
 President of the United States. It will not be too strong to say,
 that there will be a constant probability of seeing the station
 filled by characters pre-eminent for ability and virtue. And this
 will be thought no inconsiderable recommendation of the
 Constitution, by those who are able to estimate the share which the
 executive in every government must necessarily have in its good or
 ill administration. Though we cannot acquiesce in the political
 heresy of the poet who says:  ``For forms of government let fools
 contest That which is best  administered is best,''
 yet we may safely pronounce, that the true test of a good
 government is its aptitude and tendency to produce a good
 administration.
The Vice-President is to be chosen in the same manner with the
 President; with this difference, that the Senate is to do, in
 respect to the former, what is to be done by the House of
 Representatives, in respect to the latter.
The appointment of an extraordinary person, as Vice-President,
 has been objected to as superfluous, if not mischievous. It has
 been alleged, that it would have been preferable to have authorized
 the Senate to elect out of their own body an officer answering that
 description. But two considerations seem to justify the ideas of
 the convention in this respect. One is, that to secure at all times
 the possibility of a definite resolution of the body, it is
 necessary that the President should have only a casting vote. And
 to take the senator of any State from his seat as senator, to place
 him in that of President of the Senate, would be to exchange, in
 regard to the State from which he came, a constant for a contingent
 vote. The other consideration is, that as the Vice-President may
 occasionally become a substitute for the President, in the supreme
 executive magistracy, all the reasons which recommend the mode of
 election prescribed for the one, apply with great if not with equal
 force to the manner of appointing the other. It is remarkable that
 in this, as in most other instances, the objection which is made
 would lie against the constitution of this State. We have a
 Lieutenant-Governor, chosen by the people at large, who presides in
 the Senate, and is the constitutional substitute for the Governor,
 in casualties similar to those which would authorize the
 Vice-President to exercise the authorities and discharge the duties
 of the President.

FEDERALIST No. 69

The Real Character of the Executive
From the New York Packet.
Friday, March 14, 1788.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
I PROCEED now to trace the real characters of the proposed
 Executive, as they are marked out in the plan of the convention.
 This will serve to place in a strong light the unfairness of the
 representations which have been made in regard to it.
The first thing which strikes our attention is, that the
 executive authority, with few exceptions, is to be vested in a
 single magistrate. This will scarcely, however, be considered as a
 point upon which any comparison can be grounded; for if, in this
 particular, there be a resemblance to the king of Great Britain,
 there is not less a resemblance to the Grand Seignior, to the khan
 of Tartary, to the Man of the Seven Mountains, or to the governor of
 New York.
That magistrate is to be elected for FOUR years; and is to be
 re-eligible as often as the people of the United States shall think
 him worthy of their confidence. In these circumstances there is a
 total dissimilitude between HIM and a king of Great Britain, who is
 an HEREDITARY monarch, possessing the crown as a patrimony
 descendible to his heirs forever; but there is a close analogy
 between HIM and a governor of New York, who is elected for THREE
 years, and is re-eligible without limitation or intermission. If we
 consider how much less time would be requisite for establishing a
 dangerous influence in a single State, than for establishing a like
 influence throughout the United States, we must conclude that a
 duration of FOUR years for the Chief Magistrate of the Union is a
 degree of permanency far less to be dreaded in that office, than a
 duration of THREE years for a corresponding office in a single State.
The President of the United States would be liable to be
 impeached, tried, and, upon conviction of treason, bribery, or other
 high crimes or misdemeanors, removed from office; and would
 afterwards be liable to prosecution and punishment in the ordinary
 course of law. The person of the king of Great Britain is sacred
 and inviolable; there is no constitutional tribunal to which he is
 amenable; no punishment to which he can be subjected without
 involving the crisis of a national revolution. In this delicate and
 important circumstance of personal responsibility, the President of
 Confederated America would stand upon no better ground than a
 governor of New York, and upon worse ground than the governors of
 Maryland and Delaware.
The President of the United States is to have power to return a
 bill, which shall have passed the two branches of the legislature,
 for reconsideration; and the bill so returned is to become a law,
 if, upon that reconsideration, it be approved by two thirds of both
 houses. The king of Great Britain, on his part, has an absolute
 negative upon the acts of the two houses of Parliament. The disuse
 of that power for a considerable time past does not affect the
 reality of its existence; and is to be ascribed wholly to the
 crown's having found the means of substituting influence to
 authority, or the art of gaining a majority in one or the other of
 the two houses, to the necessity of exerting a prerogative which
 could seldom be exerted without hazarding some degree of national
 agitation. The qualified negative of the President differs widely
 from this absolute negative of the British sovereign; and tallies
 exactly with the revisionary authority of the council of revision of
 this State, of which the governor is a constituent part. In this
 respect the power of the President would exceed that of the governor
 of New York, because the former would possess, singly, what the
 latter shares with the chancellor and judges; but it would be
 precisely the same with that of the governor of Massachusetts, whose
 constitution, as to this article, seems to have been the original
 from which the convention have copied.
The President is to be the ``commander-in-chief of the army and
 navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several States,
 when called into the actual service of the United States. He is to
 have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the
 United States, EXCEPT IN CASES OF IMPEACHMENT; to recommend to the
 consideration of Congress such measures as he shall judge necessary
 and expedient; to convene, on extraordinary occasions, both houses
 of the legislature, or either of them, and, in case of disagreement
 between them WITH RESPECT TO THE TIME OF ADJOURNMENT, to adjourn
 them to such time as he shall think proper; to take care that the
 laws be faithfully executed; and to commission all officers of the
 United States.'' In most of these particulars, the power of the
 President will resemble equally that of the king of Great Britain
 and of the governor of New York. The most material points of
 difference are these:  First. The President will have only the
 occasional command of such part of the militia of the nation as by
 legislative provision may be called into the actual service of the
 Union. The king of Great Britain and the governor of New York have
 at all times the entire command of all the militia within their
 several jurisdictions. In this article, therefore, the power of the
 President would be inferior to that of either the monarch or the
 governor. Secondly. The President is to be commander-in-chief
 of the army and navy of the United States. In this respect his
 authority would be nominally the same with that of the king of Great
 Britain, but in substance much inferior to it. It would amount to
 nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military
 and naval forces, as first General and admiral of the Confederacy;
 while that of the British king extends to the DECLARING of war and
 to the RAISING and REGULATING of fleets and armies, all which, by
 the Constitution under consideration, would appertain to the
 legislature.1 The governor of New York, on the other hand, is
 by the constitution of the State vested only with the command of its
 militia and navy. But the constitutions of several of the States
 expressly declare their governors to be commanders-in-chief, as well
 of the army as navy; and it may well be a question, whether those
 of New Hampshire and Massachusetts, in particular, do not, in this
 instance, confer larger powers upon their respective governors, than
 could be claimed by a President of the United States. Thirdly.
 The power of the President, in respect to pardons, would extend to
 all cases, EXCEPT THOSE OF IMPEACHMENT. The governor of New York
 may pardon in all cases, even in those of impeachment, except for
 treason and murder. Is not the power of the governor, in this
 article, on a calculation of political consequences, greater than
 that of the President? All conspiracies and plots against the
 government, which have not been matured into actual treason, may be
 screened from punishment of every kind, by the interposition of the
 prerogative of pardoning. If a governor of New York, therefore,
 should be at the head of any such conspiracy, until the design had
 been ripened into actual hostility he could insure his accomplices
 and adherents an entire impunity. A President of the Union, on the
 other hand, though he may even pardon treason, when prosecuted in
 the ordinary course of law, could shelter no offender, in any
 degree, from the effects of impeachment and conviction. Would not
 the prospect of a total indemnity for all the preliminary steps be a
 greater temptation to undertake and persevere in an enterprise
 against the public liberty, than the mere prospect of an exemption
 from death and confiscation, if the final execution of the design,
 upon an actual appeal to arms, should miscarry? Would this last
 expectation have any influence at all, when the probability was
 computed, that the person who was to afford that exemption might
 himself be involved in the consequences of the measure, and might be
 incapacitated by his agency in it from affording the desired
 impunity? The better to judge of this matter, it will be necessary
 to recollect, that, by the proposed Constitution, the offense of
 treason is limited ``to levying war upon the United States, and
 adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort''; and that
 by the laws of New York it is confined within similar bounds.
 Fourthly. The President can only adjourn the national legislature
 in the single case of disagreement about the time of adjournment.
 The British monarch may prorogue or even dissolve the Parliament.
 The governor of New York may also prorogue the legislature of this
 State for a limited time; a power which, in certain situations, may
 be employed to very important purposes.
The President is to have power, with the advice and consent of
 the Senate, to make treaties, provided two thirds of the senators
 present concur. The king of Great Britain is the sole and absolute
 representative of the nation in all foreign transactions. He can of
 his own accord make treaties of peace, commerce, alliance, and of
 every other description. It has been insinuated, that his authority
 in this respect is not conclusive, and that his conventions with
 foreign powers are subject to the revision, and stand in need of the
 ratification, of Parliament. But I believe this doctrine was never
 heard of, until it was broached upon the present occasion. Every
 jurist2 of that kingdom, and every other man acquainted with its
 Constitution, knows, as an established fact, that the prerogative of
 making treaties exists in the crown in its utomst plentitude; and
 that the compacts entered into by the royal authority have the most
 complete legal validity and perfection, independent of any other
 sanction. The Parliament, it is true, is sometimes seen employing
 itself in altering the existing laws to conform them to the
 stipulations in a new treaty; and this may have possibly given
 birth to the imagination, that its co-operation was necessary to the
 obligatory efficacy of the treaty. But this parliamentary
 interposition proceeds from a different cause: from the necessity
 of adjusting a most artificial and intricate system of revenue and
 commercial laws, to the changes made in them by the operation of the
 treaty; and of adapting new provisions and precautions to the new
 state of things, to keep the machine from running into disorder. In
 this respect, therefore, there is no comparison between the intended
 power of the President and the actual power of the British sovereign. 
 The one can perform alone what the other can do only with the
 concurrence of a branch of the legislature. It must be admitted,
 that, in this instance, the power of the federal Executive would
 exceed that of any State Executive. But this arises naturally from
 the sovereign power which relates to treaties. If the Confederacy
 were to be dissolved, it would become a question, whether the
 Executives of the several States were not solely invested with that
 delicate and important prerogative.
The President is also to be authorized to receive ambassadors
 and other public ministers. This, though it has been a rich theme
 of declamation, is more a matter of dignity than of authority. It
 is a circumstance which will be without consequence in the
 administration of the government; and it was far more convenient
 that it should be arranged in this manner, than that there should be
 a necessity of convening the legislature, or one of its branches,
 upon every arrival of a foreign minister, though it were merely to
 take the place of a departed predecessor.
The President is to nominate, and, WITH THE ADVICE AND CONSENT
 OF THE SENATE, to appoint ambassadors and other public ministers,
 judges of the Supreme Court, and in general all officers of the
 United States established by law, and whose appointments are not
 otherwise provided for by the Constitution. The king of Great
 Britain is emphatically and truly styled the fountain of honor. He
 not only appoints to all offices, but can create offices. He can
 confer titles of nobility at pleasure; and has the disposal of an
 immense number of church preferments. There is evidently a great
 inferiority in the power of the President, in this particular, to
 that of the British king; nor is it equal to that of the governor
 of New York, if we are to interpret the meaning of the constitution
 of the State by the practice which has obtained under it. The power
 of appointment is with us lodged in a council, composed of the
 governor and four members of the Senate, chosen by the Assembly.
 The governor CLAIMS, and has frequently EXERCISED, the right of
 nomination, and is ENTITLED to a casting vote in the appointment.
 If he really has the right of nominating, his authority is in this
 respect equal to that of the President, and exceeds it in the
 article of the casting vote. In the national government, if the
 Senate should be divided, no appointment could be made; in the
 government of New York, if the council should be divided, the
 governor can turn the scale, and confirm his own nomination.3
 If we compare the publicity which must necessarily attend the mode
 of appointment by the President and an entire branch of the national
 legislature, with the privacy in the mode of appointment by the
 governor of New York, closeted in a secret apartment with at most
 four, and frequently with only two persons; and if we at the same
 time consider how much more easy it must be to influence the small
 number of which a council of appointment consists, than the
 considerable number of which the national Senate would consist, we
 cannot hesitate to pronounce that the power of the chief magistrate
 of this State, in the disposition of offices, must, in practice, be
 greatly superior to that of the Chief Magistrate of the Union.
Hence it appears that, except as to the concurrent authority of
 the President in the article of treaties, it would be difficult to
 determine whether that magistrate would, in the aggregate, possess
 more or less power than the Governor of New York. And it appears
 yet more unequivocally, that there is no pretense for the parallel
 which has been attempted between him and the king of Great Britain.
 But to render the contrast in this respect still more striking, it
 may be of use to throw the principal circumstances of dissimilitude
 into a closer group.
The President of the United States would be an officer elected
 by the people for FOUR years; the king of Great Britain is a
 perpetual and HEREDITARY prince. The one would be amenable to
 personal punishment and disgrace; the person of the other is sacred
 and inviolable. The one would have a QUALIFIED negative upon the
 acts of the legislative body; the other has an ABSOLUTE negative.
 The one would have a right to command the military and naval forces
 of the nation; the other, in addition to this right, possesses that
 of DECLARING war, and of RAISING and REGULATING fleets and armies by
 his own authority. The one would have a concurrent power with a
 branch of the legislature in the formation of treaties; the other
 is the SOLE POSSESSOR of the power of making treaties. The one
 would have a like concurrent authority in appointing to offices;
 the other is the sole author of all appointments. The one can
 confer no privileges whatever; the other can make denizens of
 aliens, noblemen of commoners; can erect corporations with all the
 rights incident to corporate bodies. The one can prescribe no rules
 concerning the commerce or currency of the nation; the other is in
 several respects the arbiter of commerce, and in this capacity can
 establish markets and fairs, can regulate weights and measures, can
 lay embargoes for a limited time, can coin money, can authorize or
 prohibit the circulation of foreign coin. The one has no particle
 of spiritual jurisdiction; the other is the supreme head and
 governor of the national church! What answer shall we give to those
 who would persuade us that things so unlike resemble each other?
 The same that ought to be given to those who tell us that a
 government, the whole power of which would be in the hands of the
 elective and periodical servants of the people, is an aristocracy, a
 monarchy, and a despotism.

1 A writer in a Pennsylvania paper, under the signature of
 TAMONY, has asserted that the king of Great Britain oweshis
 prerogative as commander-in-chief to an annual mutiny bill. The
 truth is, on the contrary, that his prerogative, in this respect, is
 immenmorial, and was only disputed, ``contrary to all reason and
 precedent,'' as Blackstone vol. i., page 262, expresses it, by the
 Long Parliament of Charles I. but by the statute the 13th of Charles
 II., chap. 6, it was declared to be in the king alone, for that the
 sole supreme government and command of the militia within his
 Majesty's realms and dominions, and of all forces by sea and land,
 and of all forts and places of strength, EVER WAS AND IS the
 undoubted right of his Majesty and his royal predecessors, kings and
 queens of England, and that both or either house of Parliament
 cannot nor ought to pretend to the same.

 the claim of the governor to a right of nomination well founded.
 Yet it is always justifiable to reason from the practice of a
 government, till its propriety has been constitutionally questioned.

 considerations, and pursue them through all their consequences, we
 shall be inclined to draw much the same conclusion.

FEDERALIST No. 70

The Executive Department Further Considered
From the New York Packet.
Tuesday, March 18, 1788.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
THERE is an idea, which is not without its advocates, that a
 vigorous Executive is inconsistent with the genius of republican
 government. The enlightened well-wishers to this species of
 government must at least hope that the supposition is destitute of
 foundation; since they can never admit its truth, without at the
 same time admitting the condemnation of their own principles.
 Energy in the Executive is a leading character in the definition of
 good government. It is essential to the protection of the community
 against foreign attacks; it is not less essential to the steady
 administration of the laws; to the protection of property against
 those irregular and high-handed combinations which sometimes
 interrupt the ordinary course of justice; to the security of
 liberty against the enterprises and assaults of ambition, of
 faction, and of anarchy. Every man the least conversant in Roman
 story, knows how often that republic was obliged to take refuge in
 the absolute power of a single man, under the formidable title of
 Dictator, as well against the intrigues of ambitious individuals who
 aspired to the tyranny, and the seditions of whole classes of the
 community whose conduct threatened the existence of all government,
 as against the invasions of external enemies who menaced the
 conquest and destruction of Rome.
There can be no need, however, to multiply arguments or examples
 on this head. A feeble Executive implies a feeble execution of the
 government. A feeble execution is but another phrase for a bad
 execution; and a government ill executed, whatever it may be in
 theory, must be, in practice, a bad government.
Taking it for granted, therefore, that all men of sense will
 agree in the necessity of an energetic Executive, it will only
 remain to inquire, what are the ingredients which constitute this
 energy? How far can they be combined with those other ingredients
 which constitute safety in the republican sense? And how far does
 this combination characterize the plan which has been reported by
 the convention?
The ingredients which constitute energy in the Executive are,
 first, unity; secondly, duration; thirdly, an adequate provision
 for its support; fourthly, competent powers.
The ingredients which constitute safety in the repub lican sense
 are, first, a due dependence on the people, secondly, a due
 responsibility.
Those politicians and statesmen who have been the most
 celebrated for the soundness of their principles and for the justice
 of their views, have declared in favor of a single Executive and a
 numerous legislature. They have with great propriety, considered
 energy as the most necessary qualification of the former, and have
 regarded this as most applicable to power in a single hand, while
 they have, with equal propriety, considered the latter as best
 adapted to deliberation and wisdom, and best calculated to
 conciliate the confidence of the people and to secure their
 privileges and interests.
That unity is conducive to energy will not be disputed.
 Decision, activity, secrecy, and despatch will generally
 characterize the proceedings of one man in a much more eminent
 degree than the proceedings of any greater number; and in
 proportion as the number is increased, these qualities will be
 diminished.
This unity may be destroyed in two ways: either by vesting the
 power in two or more magistrates of equal dignity and authority; or
 by vesting it ostensibly in one man, subject, in whole or in part,
 to the control and co-operation of others, in the capacity of
 counsellors to him. Of the first, the two Consuls of Rome may serve
 as an example; of the last, we shall find examples in the
 constitutions of several of the States. New York and New Jersey, if
 I recollect right, are the only States which have intrusted the
 executive authority wholly to single men.1 Both these methods
 of destroying the unity of the Executive have their partisans; but
 the votaries of an executive council are the most numerous. They
 are both liable, if not to equal, to similar objections, and may in
 most lights be examined in conjunction.
The experience of other nations will afford little instruction
 on this head. As far, however, as it teaches any thing, it teaches
 us not to be enamoured of plurality in the Executive. We have seen
 that the Achaeans, on an experiment of two Praetors, were induced to
 abolish one. The Roman history records many instances of mischiefs
 to the republic from the dissensions between the Consuls, and
 between the military Tribunes, who were at times substituted for the
 Consuls. But it gives us no specimens of any peculiar advantages
 derived to the state from the circumstance of the plurality of those
 magistrates. That the dissensions between them were not more
 frequent or more fatal, is a matter of astonishment, until we advert
 to the singular position in which the republic was almost
 continually placed, and to the prudent policy pointed out by the
 circumstances of the state, and pursued by the Consuls, of making a
 division of the government between them. The patricians engaged in
 a perpetual struggle with the plebeians for the preservation of
 their ancient authorities and dignities; the Consuls, who were
 generally chosen out of the former body, were commonly united by the
 personal interest they had in the defense of the privileges of their
 order. In addition to this motive of union, after the arms of the
 republic had considerably expanded the bounds of its empire, it
 became an established custom with the Consuls to divide the
 administration between themselves by lot one of them remaining at
 Rome to govern the city and its environs, the other taking the
 command in the more distant provinces. This expedient must, no
 doubt, have had great influence in preventing those collisions and
 rivalships which might otherwise have embroiled the peace of the
 republic.
But quitting the dim light of historical research, attaching
 ourselves purely to the dictates of reason and good se se, we shall
 discover much greater cause to reject than to approve the idea of
 plurality in the Executive, under any modification whatever.
Wherever two or more persons are engaged in any common
 enterprise or pursuit, there is always danger of difference of
 opinion. If it be a public trust or office, in which they are
 clothed with equal dignity and authority, there is peculiar danger
 of personal emulation and even animosity. From either, and
 especially from all these causes, the most bitter dissensions are
 apt to spring. Whenever these happen, they lessen the
 respectability, weaken the authority, and distract the plans and
 operation of those whom they divide. If they should unfortunately
 assail the supreme executive magistracy of a country, consisting of
 a plurality of persons, they might impede or frustrate the most
 important measures of the government, in the most critical
 emergencies of the state. And what is still worse, they might split
 the community into the most violent and irreconcilable factions,
 adhering differently to the different individuals who composed the
 magistracy.
Men often oppose a thing, merely because they have had no agency
 in planning it, or because it may have been planned by those whom
 they dislike. But if they have been consulted, and have happened to
 disapprove, opposition then becomes, in their estimation, an
 indispensable duty of self-love. They seem to think themselves
 bound in honor, and by all the motives of personal infallibility, to
 defeat the success of what has been resolved upon contrary to their
 sentiments. Men of upright, benevolent tempers have too many
 opportunities of remarking, with horror, to what desperate lengths
 this disposition is sometimes carried, and how often the great
 interests of society are sacrificed to the vanity, to the conceit,
 and to the obstinacy of individuals, who have credit enough to make
 their passions and their caprices interesting to mankind. Perhaps
 the question now before the public may, in its consequences, afford
 melancholy proofs of the effects of this despicable frailty, or
 rather detestable vice, in the human character.
Upon the principles of a free government, inconveniences from
 the source just mentioned must necessarily be submitted to in the
 formation of the legislature; but it is unnecessary, and therefore
 unwise, to introduce them into the constitution of the Executive.
 It is here too that they may be most pernicious. In the
 legislature, promptitude of decision is oftener an evil than a
 benefit. The differences of opinion, and the jarrings of parties in
 that department of the government, though they may sometimes
 obstruct salutary plans, yet often promote deliberation and
 circumspection, and serve to check excesses in the majority. When a
 resolution too is once taken, the opposition must be at an end.
 That resolution is a law, and resistance to it punishable. But no
 favorable circumstances palliate or atone for the disadvantages of
 dissension in the executive department. Here, they are pure and
 unmixed. There is no point at which they cease to operate. They
 serve to embarrass and weaken the execution of the plan or measure
 to which they relate, from the first step to the final conclusion of
 it. They constantly counteract those qualities in the Executive
 which are the most necessary ingredients in its composition, vigor
 and expedition, and this without anycounterbalancing good. In the
 conduct of war, in which the energy of the Executive is the bulwark
 of the national security, every thing would be to be apprehended
 from its plurality.
It must be confessed that these observations apply with
 principal weight to the first case supposed that is, to a plurality
 of magistrates of equal dignity and authority a scheme, the
 advocates for which are not likely to form a numerous sect; but
 they apply, though not with equal, yet with considerable weight to
 the project of a council, whose concurrence is made constitutionally
 necessary to the operations of the ostensible Executive. An artful
 cabal in that council would be able to distract and to enervate the
 whole system of administration. If no such cabal should exist, the
 mere diversity of views and opinions would alone be sufficient to
 tincture the exercise of the executive authority with a spirit of
 habitual feebleness and dilatoriness.
But one of the weightiest objections to a plurality in the
 Executive, and which lies as much against the last as the first
 plan, is, that it tends to conceal faults and destroy responsibility. 
 Responsibility is of two kinds to censure and to punishment. The
 first is the more important of the two, especially in an elective
 office. Man, in public trust, will much oftener act in such a
 manner as to render him unworthy of being any longer trusted, than
 in such a manner as to make him obnoxious to legal punishment. But
 the multiplication of the Executive adds to the difficulty of
 detection in either case. It often becomes impossible, amidst
 mutual accusations, to determine on whom the blame or the punishment
 of a pernicious measure, or series of pernicious measures, ought
 really to fall. It is shifted from one to another with so much
 dexterity, and under such plausible appearances, that the public
 opinion is left in suspense about the real author. The
 circumstances which may have led to any national miscarriage or
 misfortune are sometimes so complicated that, where there are a
 number of actors who may have had different degrees and kinds of
 agency, though we may clearly see upon the whole that there has been
 mismanagement, yet it may be impracticable to pronounce to whose
 account the evil which may have been incurred is truly chargeable.
``I was overruled by my council. The council were so divided in
 their opinions that it was impossible to obtain any better
 resolution on the point.'' These and similar pretexts are
 constantly at hand, whether true or false. And who is there that
 will either take the trouble or incur the odium, of a strict
 scrunity into the secret springs of the transaction? Should there
 be found a citizen zealous enough to undertake the unpromising task,
 if there happen to be collusion between the parties concerned, how
 easy it is to clothe the circumstances with so much ambiguity, as to
 render it uncertain what was the precise conduct of any of those
 parties?
In the single instance in which the governor of this State is
 coupled with a council that is, in the appointment to offices, we
 have seen the mischiefs of it in the view now under consideration.
 Scandalous appointments to important offices have been made. Some
 cases, indeed, have been so flagrant that ALL PARTIES have agreed in
 the impropriety of the thing. When inquiry has been made, the blame
 has been laid by the governor on the members of the council, who, on
 their part, have charged it upon his nomination; while the people
 remain altogether at a loss to determine, by whose influence their
 interests have been committed to hands so unqualified and so
 manifestly improper. In tenderness to individuals, I forbear to
 descend to particulars.
It is evident from these considerations, that the plurality of
 the Executive tends to deprive the people of the two greatest
 securities they can have for the faithful exercise of any delegated
 power, first, the restraints of public opinion, which lose their
 efficacy, as well on account of the division of the censure
 attendant on bad measures among a number, as on account of the
 uncertainty on whom it ought to fall; and, secondly, the
 opportunity of discovering with facility and clearness the
 misconduct of the persons they trust, in order either to their
 removal from office or to their actual punishment in cases which
 admit of it.
In England, the king is a perpetual magistrate; and it is a
 maxim which has obtained for the sake of the pub lic peace, that he
 is unaccountable for his administration, and his person sacred.
 Nothing, therefore, can be wiser in that kingdom, than to annex to
 the king a constitutional council, who may be responsible to the
 nation for the advice they give. Without this, there would be no
 responsibility whatever in the executive department an idea
 inadmissible in a free government. But even there the king is not
 bound by the resolutions of his council, though they are answerable
 for the advice they give. He is the absolute master of his own
 conduct in the exercise of his office, and may observe or disregard
 the counsel given to him at his sole discretion.
But in a republic, where every magistrate ought to be personally
 responsible for his behavior in office the reason which in the
 British Constitution dictates the propriety of a council, not only
 ceases to apply, but turns against the institution. In the monarchy
 of Great Britain, it furnishes a substitute for the prohibited
 responsibility of the chief magistrate, which serves in some degree
 as a hostage to the national justice for his good behavior. In the
 American republic, it would serve to destroy, or would greatly
 diminish, the intended and necessary responsibility of the Chief
 Magistrate himself.
The idea of a council to the Executive, which has so generally
 obtained in the State constitutions, has been derived from that
 maxim of republican jealousy which considers power as safer in the
 hands of a number of men than of a single man. If the maxim should
 be admitted to be applicable to the case, I should contend that the
 advantage on that side would not counterbalance the numerous
 disadvantages on the opposite side. But I do not think the rule at
 all applicable to the executive power. I clearly concur in opinion,
 in this particular, with a writer whom the celebrated Junius
 pronounces to be ``deep, solid, and ingenious,'' that ``the
 executive power is more easily confined when it is ONE'';2 that
 it is far more safe there should be a single object for the jealousy
 and watchfulness of the people; and, in a word, that all
 multiplication of the Executive is rather dangerous than friendly to
 liberty.
A little consideration will satisfy us, that the species of
 security sought for in the multiplication of the Executive, is
 unattainable. Numbers must be so great as to render combination
 difficult, or they are rather a source of danger than of security.
 The united credit and influence of several individuals must be more
 formidable to liberty, than the credit and influence of either of
 them separately. When power, therefore, is placed in the hands of
 so small a number of men, as to admit of their interests and views
 being easily combined in a common enterprise, by an artful leader,
 it becomes more liable to abuse, and more dangerous when abused,
 than if it be lodged in the hands of one man; who, from the very
 circumstance of his being alone, will be more narrowly watched and
 more readily suspected, and who cannot unite so great a mass of
 influence as when he is associated with others. The Decemvirs of
 Rome, whose name denotes their number,3 were more to be dreaded
 in their usurpation than any ONE of them would have been. No person
 would think of proposing an Executive much more numerous than that
 body; from six to a dozen have been suggested for the number of the
 council. The extreme of these numbers, is not too great for an easy
 combination; and from such a combination America would have more to
 fear, than from the ambition of any single individual. A council to
 a magistrate, who is himself responsible for what he does, are
 generally nothing better than a clog upon his good intentions, are
 often the instruments and accomplices of his bad and are almost
 always a cloak to his faults.
I forbear to dwell upon the subject of expense; though it be
 evident that if the council should be numerous enough to answer the
 principal end aimed at by the institution, the salaries of the
 members, who must be drawn from their homes to reside at the seat of
 government, would form an item in the catalogue of public
 expenditures too serious to be incurred for an object of equivocal
 utility. I will only add that, prior to the appearance of the
 Constitution, I rarely met with an intelligent man from any of the
 States, who did not admit, as the result of experience, that the
 UNITY of the executive of this State was one of the best of the
 distinguishing features of our constitution.

 appointing to offices; New Jersey has a council whom the governor
 may consult. But I think, from the terms of the constitution, their
 resolutions do not bind him.

 Magistrate himself.
The idea of a council to the Executive, which has so generally
 obtained in the State constitutions, has been derived from that
 maxim of republican jealousy which considers power as safer in the
 hands of a number of men than of a single man. If the maxim should
 be admitted to be applicable to the case, I should contend that the
 advantage on that side would not counterbalance the numerous
 disadvantages on the opposite side. But I do not think the rule at
 all applicable to the executive power. I clearly concur in opinion,
 in this particular, with a writer whom the celebrated Junius
 pronounces to be ``deep, solid, and ingenious,'' that ``the
 executive power is more easily confined when it is ONE'';2 that
 it is far more safe there should be a single object for the jealousy
 and watchfulness of the people; and, in a word, that all
 multiplication of the Executive is rather dangerous than friendly to
 liberty.
A little consideration will satisfy us, that the species of
 security sought for in the multiplication of the Executive, is
 nattainable. Numbers must be so great as to render combination
 difficult, or they are rather a source of danger than of security.
 The united credit and influence of several individuals must be more
 formidable to liberty, than the credit and influence of either of
 them separately. When power, therefore, is placed in the hands of
 so small a number of men, as to admit of their interests and views
 being easily combined in a common enterprise, by an artful leader,
 it becomes more liable to abuse, and more dangerous when abused,
 than if it be lodged in the hands of one man; who, from the very
 circumstance of his being alone, will be more narrowly watched and
 more readily suspected, and who cannot unite so great a mass of
 influence as when he is associated with others. The Decemvirs of
 Rome, whose name denotes their number,3 were more to be dreaded
 in their usurpation than any ONE of them would have been. No person
 would think of proposing an Executive much more numerous than that
 body; from six to a dozen have been suggested for the number of the
 council. The extreme of these numbers, is not too great for an easy
 combination; and from such a combination America would have more to
 fear, than from the ambition of any single individual. A council to
 a magistrate, who is himself responsible for what he does, are
 generally nothing better than a clog upon his good intentions, are
 often the instruments and accomplices of his bad and are almost
 always a cloak to his faults.
I forbear to dwell upon the subject of expense; though it be
 evident that if the council should be numerous enough to answer the
 principal end aimed at by the institution, the salaries of the
 members, who must be drawn from their homes to reside at the seat of
 government, would form an item in the catalogue of public
 expenditures too serious to be incurred for an object of equivocal
 utility. I will only add that, prior to the appearance of the
 Constitution, I rarely met with an intelligent man from any of the
 States, who did not admit, as the result of experience, that the
 UNITY of the executive of this State was one of the best of the
 distinguishing features of our constitution.

 appointing to offices; New Jersey has a council whom the governor
 may consult. But I think, from the terms of the constitution, their
 resolutions do not bind him.

FEDERALIST No. 71

The Duration in Office of the Executive
From the New York Packet.
Tuesday, March 18, 1788.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
DURATION in office has been mentioned as the second requisite to
 the energy of the Executive authority. This has relation to two
 objects: to the personal firmness of the executive magistrate, in
 the employment of his constitutional powers; and to the stability
 of the system of administration which may have been adopted under
 his auspices. With regard to the first, it must be evident, that
 the longer the duration in office, the greater will be the
 probability of obtaining so important an advantage. It is a general
 principle of human nature, that a man will be interested in whatever
 he possesses, in proportion to the firmness or precariousness of the
 tenure by which he holds it; will be less attached to what he holds
 by a momentary or uncertain title, than to what he enjoys by a
 durable or certain title; and, of course, will be willing to risk
 more for the sake of the one, than for the sake of the other. This
 remark is not less applicable to a political privilege, or honor, or
 trust, than to any article of ordinary property. The inference from
 it is, that a man acting in the capacity of chief magistrate, under
 a consciousness that in a very short time he MUST lay down his
 office, will be apt to feel himself too little interested in it to
 hazard any material censure or perplexity, from the independent
 exertion of his powers, or from encountering the ill-humors, however
 transient, which may happen to prevail, either in a considerable
 part of the society itself, or even in a predominant faction in the
 legislative body. If the case should only be, that he MIGHT lay it
 down, unless continued by a new choice, and if he should be desirous
 of being continued, his wishes, conspiring with his fears, would
 tend still more powerfully to corrupt his integrity, or debase his
 fortitude. In either case, feebleness and irresolution must be the
 characteristics of the station.
There are some who would be inclined to regard the servile
 pliancy of the Executive to a prevailing current, either in the
 community or in the legislature, as its best recommendation. But
 such men entertain very crude notions, as well of the purposes for
 which government was instituted, as of the true means by which the
 public happiness may be promoted. The republican principle demands
 that the deliberate sense of the community should govern the conduct
 of those to whom they intrust the management of their affairs; but
 it does not require an unqualified complaisance to every sudden
 breeze of passion, or to every transient impulse which the people
 may receive from the arts of men, who flatter their prejudices to
 betray their interests. It is a just observation, that the people
 commonly INTEND the PUBLIC GOOD. This often applies to their very
 errors. But their good sense would despise the adulator who should
 pretend that they always REASON RIGHT about the MEANS of promoting
 it. They know from experience that they sometimes err; and the
 wonder is that they so seldom err as they do, beset, as they
 continually are, by the wiles of parasites and sycophants, by the
 snares of the ambitious, the avaricious, the desperate, by the
 artifices of men who possess their confidence more than they deserve
 it, and of those who seek to possess rather than to deserve it.
 When occasions present themselves, in which the interests of the
 people are at variance with their inclinations, it is the duty of
 the persons whom they have appointed to be the guardians of those
 interests, to withstand the temporary delusion, in order to give
 them time and opportunity for more cool and sedate reflection.
 Instances might be cited in which a conduct of this kind has saved
 the people from very fatal consequences of their own mistakes, and
 has procured lasting monuments of their gratitude to the men who had
 courage and magnanimity enough to serve them at the peril of their
 displeasure.
But however inclined we might be to insist upon an unbounded
 complaisance in the Executive to the inclinations of the people, we
 can with no propriety contend for a like complaisance to the humors
 of the legislature. The latter may sometimes stand in opposition to
 the former, and at other times the people may be entirely neutral.
 In either supposition, it is certainly desirable that the Executive
 should be in a situation to dare to act his own opinion with vigor
 and decision.
The same rule which teaches the propriety of a partition between
 the various branches of power, teaches us likewise that this
 partition ought to be so contrived as to render the one independent
 of the other. To what purpose separate the executive or the
 judiciary from the legislative, if both the executive and the
 judiciary are so constituted as to be at the absolute devotion of
 the legislative? Such a separation must be merely nominal, and
 incapable of producing the ends for which it was established. It is
 one thing to be subordinate to the laws, and another to be dependent
 on the legislative body. The first comports with, the last
 violates, the fundamental principles of good government; and,
 whatever may be the forms of the Constitution, unites all power in
 the same hands. The tendency of the legislative authority to absorb
 every other, has been fully displayed and illustrated by examples in
 some preceding numbers. In governments purely republican, this
 tendency is almost irresistible. The representatives of the people,
 in a popular assembly, seem sometimes to fancy that they are the
 people themselves, and betray strong symptoms of impatience and
 disgust at the least sign of opposition from any other quarter; as
 if the exercise of its rights, by either the executive or judiciary,
 were a breach of their privilege and an outrage to their dignity.
 They often appear disposed to exert an imperious control over the
 other departments; and as they commonly have the people on their
 side, they always act with such momentum as to make it very
 difficult for the other members of the government to maintain the
 balance of the Constitution.
It may perhaps be asked, how the shortness of the duration in
 office can affect the independence of the Executive on the
 legislature, unless the one were possessed of the power of
 appointing or displacing the other. One answer to this inquiry may
 be drawn from the principle already remarked that is, from the
 slender interest a man is apt to take in a short-lived advantage,
 and the little inducement it affords him to expose himself, on
 account of it, to any considerable inconvenience or hazard. Another
 answer, perhaps more obvious, though not more conclusive, will
 result from the consideration of the influence of the legislative
 body over the people; which might be employed to prevent the
 re-election of a man who, by an upright resistance to any sinister
 project of that body, should have made himself obnoxious to its
 resentment.
It may be asked also, whether a duration of four years would
 answer the end proposed; and if it would not, whether a less
 period, which would at least be recommended by greater security
 against ambitious designs, would not, for that reason, be preferable
 to a longer period, which was, at the same time, too short for the
 purpose of inspiring the desired firmness and independence of the
 magistrate.
It cannot be affirmed, that a duration of four years, or any
 other limited duration, would completely answer the end proposed;
 but it would contribute towards it in a degree which would have a
 material influence upon the spirit and character of the government.
 Between the commencement and termination of such a period, there
 would always be a considerable interval, in which the prospect of
 annihilation would be sufficiently remote, not to have an improper
 effect upon the conduct of a man indued with a tolerable portion of
 fortitude; and in which he might reasonably promise himself, that
 there would be time enough before it arrived, to make the community
 sensible of the propriety of the measures he might incline to pursue. 
 Though it be probable that, as he approached the moment when the
 public were, by a new election, to signify their sense of his
 conduct, his confidence, and with it his firmness, would decline;
 yet both the one and the other would derive support from the
 opportunities which his previous continuance in the station had
 afforded him, of establishing himself in the esteem and good-will of
 his constituents. He might, then, hazard with safety, in proportion
 to the proofs he had given of his wisdom and integrity, and to the
 title he had acquired to the respect and attachment of his
 fellow-citizens. As, on the one hand, a duration of four years will
 contribute to the firmness of the Executive in a sufficient degree
 to render it a very valuable ingredient in the composition; so, on
 the other, it is not enough to justify any alarm for the public
 liberty. If a British House of Commons, from the most feeble
 beginnings, FROM THE MERE POWER OF ASSENTING OR DISAGREEING TO THE
 IMPOSITION OF A NEW TAX, have, by rapid strides, reduced the
 prerogatives of the crown and the privileges of the nobility within
 the limits they conceived to be compatible with the principles of a
 free government, while they raised themselves to the rank and
 consequence of a coequal branch of the legislature; if they have
 been able, in one instance, to abolish both the royalty and the
 aristocracy, and to overturn all the ancient establishments, as well
 in the Church as State; if they have been able, on a recent
 occasion, to make the monarch tremble at the prospect of an
 innovation1 attempted by them, what would be to be feared from
 an elective magistrate of four years' duration, with the confined
 authorities of a President of the United States? What, but that he
 might be unequal to the task which the Constitution assigns him? I
 shall only add, that if his duration be such as to leave a doubt of
 his firmness, that doubt is inconsistent with a jealousy of his
 encroachments.
PUBLIUS.
1 This was the case with respect to Mr. Fox's India bill, which
 was carried in the House of Commons, and rejected in the House of
 Lords, to the entire satisfaction, as it is said, of the people.


FEDERALIST No. 72

The Same Subject Continued, and Re-Eligibility of the Executive
 Considered
From the New York Packet.
Friday, March 21, 1788.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
THE administration of government, in its largest sense,
 comprehends all the operations of the body politic, whether
 legislative, executive, or judiciary; but in its most usual, and
 perhaps its most precise signification. it is limited to executive
 details, and falls peculiarly within the province of the executive
 department. The actual conduct of foreign negotiations, the
 preparatory plans of finance, the application and disbursement of
 the public moneys in conformity to the general appropriations of the
 legislature, the arrangement of the army and navy, the directions of
 the operations of war, these, and other matters of a like nature,
 constitute what seems to be most properly understood by the
 administration of government. The persons, therefore, to whose
 immediate management these different matters are committed, ought to
 be considered as the assistants or deputies of the chief magistrate,
 and on this account, they ought to derive their offices from his
 appointment, at least from his nomination, and ought to be subject
 to his superintendence. This view of the subject will at once
 suggest to us the intimate connection between the duration of the
 executive magistrate in office and the stability of the system of
 administration. To reverse and undo what has been done by a
 predecessor, is very often considered by a successor as the best
 proof he can give of his own capacity and desert; and in addition
 to this propensity, where the alteration has been the result of
 public choice, the person substituted is warranted in supposing that
 the dismission of his predecessor has proceeded from a dislike to
 his measures; and that the less he resembles him, the more he will
 recommend himself to the favor of his constituents. These
 considerations, and the influence of personal confidences and
 attachments, would be likely to induce every new President to
 promote a change of men to fill the subordinate stations; and these
 causes together could not fail to occasion a disgraceful and ruinous
 mutability in the administration of the government.
With a positive duration of considerable extent, I connect the
 circumstance of re-eligibility. The first is necessary to give to
 the officer himself the inclination and the resolution to act his
 part well, and to the community time and leisure to observe the
 tendency of his measures, and thence to form an experimental
 estimate of their merits. The last is necessary to enable the
 people, when they see reason to approve of his conduct, to continue
 him in his station, in order to prolong the utility of his talents
 and virtues, and to secure to the government the advantage of
 permanency in a wise system of administration.
Nothing appears more plausible at first sight, nor more
 ill-founded upon close inspection, than a scheme which in relation
 to the present point has had some respectable advocates, I mean that
 of continuing the chief magistrate in office for a certain time, and
 then excluding him from it, either for a limited period or forever
 after. This exclusion, whether temporary or perpetual, would have
 nearly the same effects, and these effects would be for the most
 part rather pernicious than salutary.
One ill effect of the exclusion would be a diminution of the
 inducements to good behavior. There are few men who would not feel
 much less zeal in the discharge of a duty when they were conscious
 that the advantages of the station with which it was connected must
 be relinquished at a determinate period, than when they were
 permitted to entertain a hope of OBTAINING, by MERITING, a
 continuance of them. This position will not be disputed so long as
 it is admitted that the desire of reward is one of the strongest
 incentives of human conduct; or that the best security for the
 fidelity of mankind is to make their interests coincide with their
 duty. Even the love of fame, the ruling passion of the noblest
 minds, which would prompt a man to plan and undertake extensive and
 arduous enterprises for the public benefit, requiring considerable
 time to mature and perfect them, if he could flatter himself with
 the prospect of being allowed to finish what he had begun, would, on
 the contrary, deter him from the undertaking, when he foresaw that
 he must quit the scene before he could accomplish the work, and must
 commit that, together with his own reputation, to hands which might
 be unequal or unfriendly to the task. The most to be expected from
 the generality of men, in such a situation, is the negative merit of
 not doing harm, instead of the positive merit of doing good.
Another ill effect of the exclusion would be the temptation to
 sordid views, to peculation, and, in some instances, to usurpation.
 An avaricious man, who might happen to fill the office, looking
 forward to a time when he must at all events yield up the emoluments
 he enjoyed, would feel a propensity, not easy to be resisted by such
 a man, to make the best use of the opportunity he enjoyed while it
 lasted, and might not scruple to have recourse to the most corrupt
 expedients to make the harvest as abundant as it was transitory;
 though the same man, probably, with a different prospect before
 him, might content himself with the regular perquisites of his
 situation, and might even be unwilling to risk the consequences of
 an abuse of his opportunities. His avarice might be a guard upon
 his avarice. Add to this that the same man might be vain or
 ambitious, as well as avaricious. And if he could expect to prolong
 his honors by his good conduct, he might hesitate to sacrifice his
 appetite for them to his appetite for gain. But with the prospect
 before him of approaching an inevitable annihilation, his avarice
 would be likely to get the victory over his caution, his vanity, or
 his ambition.
An ambitious man, too, when he found himself seated on the
 summit of his country's honors, when he looked forward to the time
 at which he must descend from the exalted eminence for ever, and
 reflected that no exertion of merit on his part could save him from
 the unwelcome reverse; such a man, in such a situation, would be
 much more violently tempted to embrace a favorable conjuncture for
 attempting the prolongation of his power, at every personal hazard,
 than if he had the probability of answering the same end by doing
 his duty.
Would it promote the peace of the community, or the stability of
 the government to have half a dozen men who had had credit enough to
 be raised to the seat of the supreme magistracy, wandering among the
 people like discontented ghosts, and sighing for a place which they
 were destined never more to possess?
A third ill effect of the exclusion would be, the depriving the
 community of the advantage of the experience gained by the chief
 magistrate in the exercise of his office. That experience is the
 parent of wisdom, is an adage the truth of which is recognized by
 the wisest as well as the simplest of mankind. What more desirable
 or more essential than this quality in the governors of nations?
 Where more desirable or more essential than in the first magistrate
 of a nation? Can it be wise to put this desirable and essential
 quality under the ban of the Constitution, and to declare that the
 moment it is acquired, its possessor shall be compelled to abandon
 the station in which it was acquired, and to which it is adapted?
 This, nevertheless, is the precise import of all those regulations
 which exclude men from serving their country, by the choice of their
 fellowcitizens, after they have by a course of service fitted
 themselves for doing it with a greater degree of utility.
A fourth ill effect of the exclusion would be the banishing men
 from stations in which, in certain emergencies of the state, their
 presence might be of the greatest moment to the public interest or
 safety. There is no nation which has not, at one period or another,
 experienced an absolute necessity of the services of particular men
 in particular situations; perhaps it would not be too strong to
 say, to the preservation of its political existence. How unwise,
 therefore, must be every such self-denying ordinance as serves to
 prohibit a nation from making use of its own citizens in the manner
 best suited to its exigencies and circumstances! Without supposing
 the personal essentiality of the man, it is evident that a change of
 the chief magistrate, at the breaking out of a war, or at any
 similar crisis, for another, even of equal merit, would at all times
 be detrimental to the community, inasmuch as it would substitute
 inexperience to experience, and would tend to unhinge and set afloat
 the already settled train of the administration.
A fifth ill effect of the exclusion would be, that it would
 operate as a constitutional interdiction of stability in the
 administration. By NECESSITATING a change of men, in the first
 office of the nation, it would necessitate a mutability of measures.
 It is not generally to be expected, that men will vary and measures
 remain uniform. The contrary is the usual course of things. And we
 need not be apprehensive that there will be too much stability,
 while there is even the option of changing; nor need we desire to
 prohibit the people from continuing their confidence where they
 think it may be safely placed, and where, by constancy on their
 part, they may obviate the fatal inconveniences of fluctuating
 councils and a variable policy.
These are some of the disadvantages which would flow from the
 principle of exclusion. They apply most forcibly to the scheme of a
 perpetual exclusion; but when we consider that even a partial
 exclusion would always render the readmission of the person a remote
 and precarious object, the observations which have been made will
 apply nearly as fully to one case as to the other.
What are the advantages promised to counterbalance these
 disadvantages? They are represented to be: 1st, greater
 independence in the magistrate; 2d, greater security to the people.
 Unless the exclusion be perpetual, there will be no pretense to
 infer the first advantage. But even in that case, may he have no
 object beyond his present station, to which he may sacrifice his
 independence? May he have no connections, no friends, for whom he
 may sacrifice it? May he not be less willing by a firm conduct, to
 make personal enemies, when he acts under the impression that a time
 is fast approaching, on the arrival of which he not only MAY, but
 MUST, be exposed to their resentments, upon an equal, perhaps upon
 an inferior, footing? It is not an easy point to determine whether
 his independence would be most promoted or impaired by such an
 arrangement.
As to the second supposed advantage, there is still greater
 reason to entertain doubts concerning it. If the exclusion were to
 be perpetual, a man of irregular ambition, of whom alone there could
 be reason in any case to entertain apprehension, would, with
 infinite reluctance, yield to the necessity of taking his leave
 forever of a post in which his passion for power and pre-eminence
 had acquired the force of habit. And if he had been fortunate or
 adroit enough to conciliate the good-will of the people, he might
 induce them to consider as a very odious and unjustifiable restraint
 upon themselves, a provision which was calculated to debar them of
 the right of giving a fresh proof of their attachment to a favorite.
 There may be conceived circumstances in which this disgust of the
 people, seconding the thwarted ambition of such a favorite, might
 occasion greater danger to liberty, than could ever reasonably be
 dreaded from the possibility of a perpetuation in office, by the
 voluntary suffrages of the community, exercising a constitutional
 privilege.
There is an excess of refinement in the idea of disabling the
 people to continue in office men who had entitled themselves, in
 their opinion, to approbation and confidence; the advantages of
 which are at best speculative and equivocal, and are overbalanced by
 disadvantages far more certain and decisive.
PUBLIUS.


FEDERALIST No. 73
The Provision For The Support of the Executive, and the Veto Power
From the New York Packet.
Friday, March 21, 1788.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
THE third ingredient towards constituting the vigor of the
 executive authority, is an adequate provision for its support. It
 is evident that, without proper attention to this article, the
 separation of the executive from the legislative department would be
 merely nominal and nugatory. The legislature, with a discretionary
 power over the salary and emoluments of the Chief Magistrate, could
 render him as obsequious to their will as they might think proper to
 make him. They might, in most cases, either reduce him by famine,
 or tempt him by largesses, to surrender at discretion his judgment
 to their inclinations. These expressions, taken in all the latitude
 of the terms, would no doubt convey more than is intended. There
 are men who could neither be distressed nor won into a sacrifice of
 their duty; but this stern virtue is the growth of few soils; and
 in the main it will be found that a power over a man's support is a
 power over his will. If it were necessary to confirm so plain a
 truth by facts, examples would not be wanting, even in this country,
 of the intimidation or seduction of the Executive by the terrors or
 allurements of the pecuniary arrangements of the legislative body.
It is not easy, therefore, to commend too highly the judicious
 attention which has been paid to this subject in the proposed
 Constitution. It is there provided that ``The President of the
 United States shall, at stated times, receive for his services a
 compensation WHICH SHALL NEITHER BE INCREASED NOR DIMINISHED DURING
 THE PERIOD FOR WHICH HE SHALL HAVE BEEN ELECTED; and he SHALL NOT
 RECEIVE WITHIN THAT PERIOD ANY OTHER EMOLUMENT from the United
 States, or any of them.'' It is impossible to imagine any provision
 which would have been more eligible than this. The legislature, on
 the appointment of a President, is once for all to declare what
 shall be the compensation for his services during the time for which
 he shall have been elected. This done, they will have no power to
 alter it, either by increase or diminution, till a new period of
 service by a new election commences. They can neither weaken his
 fortitude by operating on his necessities, nor corrupt his integrity
 by appealing to his avarice. Neither the Union, nor any of its
 members, will be at liberty to give, nor will he be at liberty to
 receive, any other emolument than that which may have been
 determined by the first act. He can, of course, have no pecuniary
 inducement to renounce or desert the independence intended for him
 by the Constitution.
The last of the requisites to energy, which have been
 enumerated, are competent powers. Let us proceed to consider those
 which are proposed to be vested in the President of the United
 States.
The first thing that offers itself to our observation, is the
 qualified negative of the President upon the acts or resolutions of
 the two houses of the legislature; or, in other words, his power of
 returning all bills with objections, to have the effect of
 preventing their becoming laws, unless they should afterwards be
 ratified by two thirds of each of the component members of the
 legislative body.
The propensity of the legislative department to intrude upon the
 rights, and to absorb the powers, of the other departments, has been
 already suggested and repeated; the insufficiency of a mere
 parchment delineation of the boundaries of each, has also been
 remarked upon; and the necessity of furnishing each with
 constitutional arms for its own defense, has been inferred and
 proved. From these clear and indubitable principles results the
 propriety of a negative, either absolute or qualified, in the
 Executive, upon the acts of the legislative branches. Without the
 one or the other, the former would be absolutely unable to defend
 himself against the depredations of the latter. He might gradually
 be stripped of his authorities by successive resolutions, or
 annihilated by a single vote. And in the one mode or the other, the
 legislative and executive powers might speedily come to be blended
 in the same hands. If even no propensity had ever discovered itself
 in the legislative body to invade the rights of the Executive, the
 rules of just reasoning and theoretic propriety would of themselves
 teach us, that the one ought not to be left to the mercy of the
 other, but ought to possess a constitutional and effectual power of
 selfdefense.
But the power in question has a further use. It not only serves
 as a shield to the Executive, but it furnishes an additional
 security against the enaction of improper laws. It establishes a
 salutary check upon the legislative body, calculated to guard the
 community against the effects of faction, precipitancy, or of any
 impulse unfriendly to the public good, which may happen to influence
 a majority of that body.
The propriety of a negative has, upon some occasions, been
 combated by an observation, that it was not to be presumed a single
 man would possess more virtue and wisdom than a number of men; and
 that unless this presumption should be entertained, it would be
 improper to give the executive magistrate any species of control
 over the legislative body.
But this observation, when examined, will appear rather specious
 than solid. The propriety of the thing does not turn upon the
 supposition of superior wisdom or virtue in the Executive, but upon
 the supposition that the legislature will not be infallible; that
 the love of power may sometimes betray it into a disposition to
 encroach upon the rights of other members of the government; that a
 spirit of faction may sometimes pervert its deliberations; that
 impressions of the moment may sometimes hurry it into measures which
 itself, on maturer reflexion, would condemn. The primary inducement
 to conferring the power in question upon the Executive is, to enable
 him to defend himself; the secondary one is to increase the chances
 in favor of the community against the passing of bad laws, through
 haste, inadvertence, or design. The oftener the measure is brought
 under examination, the greater the diversity in the situations of
 those who are to examine it, the less must be the danger of those
 errors which flow from want of due deliberation, or of those
 missteps which proceed from the contagion of some common passion or
 interest. It is far less probable, that culpable views of any kind
 should infect all the parts of the government at the same moment and
 in relation to the same object, than that they should by turns
 govern and mislead every one of them.
It may perhaps be said that the power of preventing bad laws
 includes that of preventing good ones; and may be used to the one
 purpose as well as to the other. But this objection will have
 little weight with those who can properly estimate the mischiefs of
 that inconstancy and mutability in the laws, which form the greatest
 blemish in the character and genius of our governments. They will
 consider every institution calculated to restrain the excess of
 law-making, and to keep things in the same state in which they
 happen to be at any given period, as much more likely to do good
 than harm; because it is favorable to greater stability in the
 system of legislation. The injury which may possibly be done by
 defeating a few good laws, will be amply compensated by the
 advantage of preventing a number of bad ones.
Nor is this all. The superior weight and influence of the
 legislative body in a free government, and the hazard to the
 Executive in a trial of strength with that body, afford a
 satisfactory security that the negative would generally be employed
 with great caution; and there would oftener be room for a charge of
 timidity than of rashness in the exercise of it. A king of Great
 Britain, with all his train of sovereign attributes, and with all
 the influence he draws from a thousand sources, would, at this day,
 hesitate to put a negative upon the joint resolutions of the two
 houses of Parliament. He would not fail to exert the utmost
 resources of that influence to strangle a measure disagreeable to
 him, in its progress to the throne, to avoid being reduced to the
 dilemma of permitting it to take effect, or of risking the
 displeasure of the nation by an opposition to the sense of the
 legislative body. Nor is it probable, that he would ultimately
 venture to exert his prerogatives, but in a case of manifest
 propriety, or extreme necessity. All well-informed men in that
 kingdom will accede to the justness of this remark. A very
 considerable period has elapsed since the negative of the crown has
 been exercised.
If a magistrate so powerful and so well fortified as a British
 monarch, would have scruples about the exercise of the power under
 consideration, how much greater caution may be reasonably expected
 in a President of the United States, clothed for the short period of
 four years with the executive authority of a government wholly and
 purely republican?
It is evident that there would be greater danger of his not
 using his power when necessary, than of his using it too often, or
 too much. An argument, indeed, against its expediency, has been
 drawn from this very source. It has been represented, on this
 account, as a power odious in appearance, useless in practice. But
 it will not follow, that because it might be rarely exercised, it
 would never be exercised. In the case for which it is chiefly
 designed, that of an immediate attack upon the constitutional rights
 of the Executive, or in a case in which the public good was
 evidently and palpably sacrificed, a man of tolerable firmness would
 avail himself of his constitutional means of defense, and would
 listen to the admonitions of duty and responsibility. In the former
 supposition, his fortitude would be stimulated by his immediate
 interest in the power of his office; in the latter, by the
 probability of the sanction of his constituents, who, though they
 would naturally incline to the legislative body in a doubtful case,
 would hardly suffer their partiality to delude them in a very plain
 case. I speak now with an eye to a magistrate possessing only a
 common share of firmness. There are men who, under any
 circumstances, will have the courage to do their duty at every
 hazard.
But the convention have pursued a mean in this business, which
 will both facilitate the exercise of the power vested in this
 respect in the executive magistrate, and make its efficacy to depend
 on the sense of a considerable part of the legislative body.
 Instead of an absolute negative, it is proposed to give the
 Executive the qualified negative already described. This is a power
 which would be much more readily exercised than the other. A man
 who might be afraid to defeat a law by his single VETO, might not
 scruple to return it for reconsideration; subject to being finally
 rejected only in the event of more than one third of each house
 concurring in the sufficiency of his objections. He would be
 encouraged by the reflection, that if his opposition should prevail,
 it would embark in it a very respectable proportion of the
 legislative body, whose influence would be united with his in
 supporting the propriety of his conduct in the public opinion. A
 direct and categorical negative has something in the appearance of
 it more harsh, and more apt to irritate, than the mere suggestion of
 argumentative objections to be approved or disapproved by those to
 whom they are addressed. In proportion as it would be less apt to
 offend, it would be more apt to be exercised; and for this very
 reason, it may in practice be found more effectual. It is to be
 hoped that it will not often happen that improper views will govern
 so large a proportion as two thirds of both branches of the
 legislature at the same time; and this, too, in spite of the
 counterposing weight of the Executive. It is at any rate far less
 probable that this should be the case, than that such views should
 taint the resolutions and conduct of a bare majority. A power of
 this nature in the Executive, will often have a silent and
 unperceived, though forcible, operation. When men, engaged in
 unjustifiable pursuits, are aware that obstructions may come from a
 quarter which they cannot control, they will often be restrained by
 the bare apprehension of opposition, from doing what they would with
 eagerness rush into, if no such external impediments were to be
 feared.
This qualified negative, as has been elsewhere remarked, is in
 this State vested in a council, consisting of the governor, with the
 chancellor and judges of the Supreme Court, or any two of them. It
 has been freely employed upon a variety of occasions, and frequently
 with success. And its utility has become so apparent, that persons
 who, in compiling the Constitution, were violent opposers of it,
 have from experience become its declared admirers.1
I have in another place remarked, that the convention, in the
 formation of this part of their plan, had departed from the model of
 the constitution of this State, in favor of that of Massachusetts.
 Two strong reasons may be imagined for this preference. One is
 that the judges, who are to be the interpreters of the law, might
 receive an improper bias, from having given a previous opinion in
 their revisionary capacities; the other is that by being often
 associated with the Executive, they might be induced to embark too
 far in the political views of that magistrate, and thus a dangerous
 combination might by degrees be cemented between the executive and
 judiciary departments. It is impossible to keep the judges too
 distinct from every other avocation than that of expounding the laws. 
 It is peculiarly dangerous to place them in a situation to be
 either corrupted or influenced by the Executive.
PUBLIUS.

 convention is of this number.


FEDERALIST No. 74

The Command of the Military and Naval Forces, and the Pardoning
 Power of the Executive
From the New York Packet.
Tuesday, March 25, 1788.

HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:
THE President of the United States is to be ``commander-in-chief
 of the army and navy of the United States, and of the militia of the
 several States WHEN CALLED INTO THE ACTUAL SERVICE of the United
 States.'' The propriety of this provision is so evident in itself,
 and it is, at the same time, so consonant to the precedents of the
 State constitutions in general, that little need be said to explain
 or enforce it. Even those of them which have, in other respects,
 coupled the chief magistrate with a council, have for the most part
 concentrated the military authority in him alone. Of all the cares
 or concerns of government, the direction of war most peculiarly
 demands those qualities which distinguish the exercise of power by a
 single hand. The direction of war implies the direction of the
 common strength; and the power of directing and employing the
 common strength, forms a usual and essential part in the definition
 of the executive authority.
``The President may require the opinion, in writing, of the
 principal officer in each of the executive departments, upon any
 subject relating to the duties of their respective officers.'' This
 I consider as a mere redundancy in the plan, as the right for which
 it provides would result of itself from the office.
He is also to be authorized to grant ``reprieves and pardons for
 offenses against the United States, EXCEPT IN CASES OF
 IMPEACHMENT.'' Humanity and good policy conspire to dictate, that
 the benign prerogative of pardoning should be as little as possible
 fettered or embarrassed. The criminal code of every country
 partakes so much of necessary severity, that without an easy access
 to exceptions in favor of unfortunate guilt, justice would wear a
 countenance too sanguinary and cruel. As the sense of
 responsibility is always strongest, in proportion as it is
 undivided, it may be inferred that a single man would be most ready
 to attend to the force of those motives which might plead for a
 mitigation of the rigor of the law, and least apt to yield to
 considerations which were calculated to shelter a fit object of its
 vengeance. The reflection that the fate of a fellow-creature
 depended on his sole fiat, would naturally inspire
 scrupulousness and caution; the dread of being accused of weakness
 or connivance, would beget equal circumspection, though of a
 different kind. On the other hand, as men generally derive
 confidence from their numbers, they might often encourage each other
 in an act of obduracy, and might be less sensible to the
 apprehension of suspicion or censure for an injudicious or affected
 clemency. On these accounts, one man appears to be a more eligible
 dispenser of the mercy of government, than a body of men.
The expediency of vesting the power of pardoning in the
 President has, if I mistake not, been only contested in relation to
 the crime of treason. This, it has been urged, ought to have
 depended upon the assent of one, or both, of the branches of the
 legislative body. I shall not deny that there are strong reasons to
 be assigned for requiring in this particular the concurrence of that
 body, or of a part of it. As treason is a crime levelled at the
 immediate being of the society, when the laws have once ascertained
 the guilt of the offender, there seems a fitness in referring the
 expediency of an act of mercy towards him to the judgment of the
 legislature. And this ought the rather to be the case, as the
 supposition of the connivance of the Chief Magistrate ought not to
 be entirely excluded. But there are also strong objections to such
 a plan. It is not to be doubted, that a single man of prudence and
 good sense is better fitted, in delicate conjunctures, to balance
 the motives which may plead for and against the remission of the
 punishment, than any numerous body whatever. It deserves particular
 attention, that treason will often be connected with seditions which
 embrace a large proportion of the community; as lately happened in
 Massachusetts. In every such case, we might expect to see the
 representation of the people tainted with the same spirit which had
 given birth to the offense. And when parties were pretty equally
 matched, the secret sympathy of the friends and favorers of the
 condemned person, availing itself of the good-nature and weakness of
 others, might frequently bestow impunity where the terror of an
 example was necessary. On the other hand, when the sedition had
 proceeded from causes which had inflamed the resentments of the
 major party, they might often be found obstinate and inexorable,
 when policy demanded a conduct of forbearance and clemency. But the
 principal argument for reposing the power of pardoning in this case
 to the Chief Magistrate is this: in seasons of insurrection or
 rebellion, there are often critical moments, when a welltimed offer
 of pardon to the insurgents or rebels may restore the tranquillity
 of the commonwealth; and which, if suffered to pass unimproved, it
 may never be possible afterwards to recall. The dilatory process of
 convening the legislature, or one of its branches, for the purpose
 of obtaining its sanction to the measure, would frequently be the
 occasion of letting slip the golden opportunity. The loss of a
 week, a day, an hour, may sometimes be fatal. If it should be
 observed, that a discretionary power, with a view to such
 contingencies, might be occasionally conferred upon the President,
 it may be answered in the first place, that it is questionable,
 whether, in a limited Constitution, that power could be</content>

THE CONSTITUTION OF THE IROQUOIS NATIONS:



           THE GREAT BINDING LAW, GAYANASHAGOWA


 1.  I am Dekanawidah and with the Five Nations' Confederate 
Lords I plant the Tree of Great Peace.  I plant it in your 
territory, Adodarhoh, and the Onondaga Nation, in the territory 
of you who are Firekeepers.
     I name the tree the Tree of the Great Long Leaves.  Under 
the shade of this Tree of the Great Peace we spread the soft 
white feathery down of the globe thistle as seats for you, 
Adodarhoh, and your cousin Lords.
     We place you upon those seats, spread soft with the 
feathery down of the globe thistle, there beneath the shade of 
the spreading branches of the Tree of Peace.  There shall you 
sit and watch the Council Fire of the Confederacy of the Five 
Nations, and all the affairs of the Five Nations shall be 
transacted at this place before you, Adodarhoh, and your cousin 
Lords, by the Confederate Lords of the Five Nations.

 2.  Roots have spread out from the Tree of the Great Peace, 
one to the north, one to the east, one to the south and one to 
the west.  The name of these roots is The Great White Roots and 
their nature is Peace and Strength.
     If any man or any nation outside the Five Nations shall 
obey the laws of the Great Peace and make known their 
disposition to the Lords of the Confederacy, they may trace the 
Roots to the Tree and if their minds are clean and they are 
obedient and promise to obey the wishes of the Confederate 
Council, they shall be welcomed to take shelter beneath the 
Tree of the Long Leaves.
     We place at the top of the Tree of the Long Leaves an 
Eagle who is able to see afar.  If he sees in the distance any 
evil approaching or any danger threatening he will at once warn 
the people of the Confederacy.

 3.  To you Adodarhoh, the Onondaga cousin Lords, I and the 
other Confederate Lords have entrusted the caretaking and the 
watching of the Five Nations Council Fire.
     When there is any business to be transacted and the 
Confederate Council is not in session, a messenger shall be 
dispatched either to Adodarhoh, Hononwirehtonh or Skanawatih, 
Fire Keepers, or to their War Chiefs with a full statement of 
the case desired to be considered.  Then shall Adodarhoh call 
his cousin (associate) Lords together and consider whether or 
not the case is of sufficient importance to demand the 
attention of the Confederate Council.  If so, Adodarhoh shall 
dispatch messengers to summon all the Confederate Lords to 
assemble beneath the Tree of the Long Leaves.
     When the Lords are assembled the Council Fire shall be 
kindled, but not with chestnut wood, and Adodarhoh shall 
formally open the Council.  
      
      [ ed note: chestnut wood throws out sparks in burning, 
           thereby creating a disturbance in the council ] 
     
     Then shall Adodarhoh and his cousin Lords, the Fire 
Keepers, announce the subject for discussion.
     The Smoke of the Confederate Council Fire shall ever 
ascend and pierce the sky so that other nations who may be 
allies may see the Council Fire of the Great Peace.
     Adodarhoh and his cousin Lords are entrusted with the 
Keeping of the Council Fire. 

 4.  You, Adodarhoh, and your thirteen cousin Lords, shall 
faithfully keep the space about the Council Fire clean and you 
shall allow neither dust nor dirt to accumulate.  I lay a Long 
Wing before you as a broom.  As a weapon against a crawling 
creature I lay a staff with you so that you may thrust it away 
from the Council Fire.  If you fail to cast it out then call 
the rest of the United Lords to your aid.

 5.  The Council of the Mohawk shall be divided into three 
parties as follows: Tekarihoken, Ayonhwhathah and Shadekariwade 
are the first party; Sharenhowaneh, Deyoenhegwenh and 
Oghrenghrehgowah are the second party, and Dehennakrineh, 
Aghstawenserenthah and Shoskoharowaneh are the third party.  
The third party is to listen only to the discussion of the 
first and second parties and if an error is made or the 
proceeding is irregular they are to call attention to it, and 
when the case is right and properly decided by the two parties 
they shall confirm the decision of the two parties and refer 
the case to the Seneca Lords for their decision.  When the 
Seneca Lords have decided in accord with the Mohawk Lords, the 
case or question shall be referred to the Cayuga and Oneida 
Lords on the opposite side of the house.

 6.  I, Dekanawidah, appoint the Mohawk Lords the heads and the 
leaders of the Five Nations Confederacy.  The Mohawk Lords are 
the foundation of the Great Peace and it shall, therefore, be 
against the Great Binding Law to pass measures in the 
Confederate Council after the Mohawk Lords have protested 
against them.
     No council of the Confederate Lords shall be legal unless 
all the Mohawk Lords are present.

 7.  Whenever the Confederate Lords shall assemble for the 
purpose of holding a council, the Onondaga Lords shall open it 
by expressing their gratitude to their cousin Lords and 
greeting them, and they shall make an address and offer thanks 
to the earth where men dwell, to the streams of water, the 
pools, the springs and the lakes, to the maize and the fruits, 
to the medicinal herbs and trees, to the forest trees for their 
usefulness, to the animals that serve as food and give their 
pelts for clothing, to the great winds and the lesser winds, to 
the Thunderers, to the Sun, the mighty warrior, to the moon, to 
the messengers of the Creator who reveal his wishes and to the 
Great Creator who dwells in the heavens above, who gives all 
the things useful to men, and who is the source and the ruler 
of health and life.
     Then shall the Onondaga Lords declare the council open.
     The council shall not sit after darkness has set in.

 8.  The Firekeepers shall formally open and close all councils 
of the Confederate Lords, and they shall pass upon all matters 
deliberated upon by the two sides and render their decision.
     Every Onondaga Lord (or his deputy) must be present at 
every Confederate Council and must agree with the majority 
without unwarrantable dissent, so that a unanimous decision may 
be rendered.
     If Adodarhoh or any of his cousin Lords are absent from a 
Confederate Council, any other Firekeeper may open and close 
the Council, but the Firekeepers present may not give any 
decisions, unless the matter is of small importance.

 9.  All the business of the Five Nations Confederate Council 
shall be conducted by the two combined bodies of Confederate 
Lords.  First the question shall be passed upon by the Mohawk 
and Seneca Lords, then it shall be discussed and passed by the 
Oneida and Cayuga Lords.  Their decisions shall then be 
referred to the Onondaga Lords, (Fire Keepers) for final 
judgement.
     The same process shall obtain when a question is brought 
before the council by an individual or a War Chief.

10. In all cases the procedure must be as follows: when the 
Mohawk and Seneca Lords have unanimously agreed upon a 
question, they shall report their decision to the Cayuga and 
Oneida Lords who shall deliberate upon the question and report 
a unanimous decision to the Mohawk Lords.  The Mohawk Lords 
will then report the standing of the case to the Firekeepers, 
who shall render a decision as they see fit in case of a 
disagreement by the two bodies, or confirm the decisions of the 
two bodies if they are identical.  The Fire Keepers shall then 
report their decision to the Mohawk Lords who shall announce it 
to the open council.

11.  If through any misunderstanding or obstinacy on the part 
of the Fire Keepers, they render a decision at variance with 
that of the Two Sides, the Two Sides shall reconsider the 
matter and if their decisions are jointly the same as before 
they shall report to the Fire Keepers who are then compelled to 
confirm their joint decision.

12.  When a case comes before the Onondaga Lords (Fire Keepers) 
for discussion and decsion, Adodarho shall introduce the matter 
to his comrade Lords who shall then discuss it in their two 
bodies.  Every Onondaga Lord except Hononwiretonh shall 
deliberate and he shall listen only.  When a unanimous decision 
shall have been reached by the two bodies of Fire Keepers, 
Adodarho shall notify Hononwiretonh of the fact when he shall 
confirm it.  He shall refuse to confirm a decision if it is not 
unanimously agreed upon by both sides of the Fire Keepers.

13.  No Lord shall ask a question of the body of Confederate 
Lords when they are discussing a case, question or 
proposition.  He may only deliberate in a low tone with the 
separate body of which he is a member.

14.  When the Council of the Five Nation Lords shall convene 
they shall appoint a speaker for the day.  He shall be a Lord 
of either the Mohawk, Onondaga or Seneca Nation.
     The next day the Council shall appoint another speaker, 
but the first speaker may be reappointed if there is no 
objection, but a speaker's term shall not be regarded more 
than for the day.

15.  No individual or foreign nation interested in a case, 
question or proposition shall have any voice in the Confederate 
Council except to answer a question put to him or them by the 
speaker for the Lords.

16.  If the conditions which shall arise at any future time 
call for an addition to or change of this law, the case shall 
be carefully considered and if a new beam seems necessary or 
beneficial, the proposed change shall be voted upon and if 
adopted it shall be called, "Added to the Rafters".


          Rights, Duties and Qualifications of Lords

17.  A bunch of a certain number of shell (wampum) strings 
each two spans in length shall be given to each of the female 
families in which the Lordship titles are vested.  The right 
of bestowing the title shall be hereditary in the family of 
the females legally possessing the bunch of shell strings and 
the strings shall be the token that the females of the family 
have the proprietary right to the Lordship title for all time 
to come, subject to certain restrictions hereinafter mentioned.

18.  If any Confederate Lord neglects or refuses to attend the 
Confederate Council, the other Lords of the Nation of which he 
is a member shall require their War Chief to request the female 
sponsors of the Lord so guilty of defection to demand his 
attendance of the Council.  If he refuses, the women holding 
the title shall immediately select another candidate for the 
title. 
     No Lord shall be asked more than once to attend the 
Confederate Council.

19.  If at any time it shall be manifest that a Confederate 
Lord has not in mind the welfare of the people or disobeys the 
rules of this Great Law, the men or women of the Confederacy, 
or both jointly, shall come to the Council and upbraid the 
erring Lord through his War Chief.  If the complaint of the 
people through the War Chief is not heeded the first time it 
shall be uttered again and then if no attention is given a 
third complaint and warning shall be given.  If the Lord is 
contumacious the matter shall go to the council of War Chiefs.  
The War Chiefs shall then divest the erring Lord of his title 
by order of the women in whom the titleship is vested.  When 
the Lord is deposed the women shall notify the Confederate 
Lords through their War Chief, and the Confederate Lords shall 
sanction the act.  The women will then select another of their 
sons as a candidate and the Lords shall elect him.  Then shall 
the chosen one be installed by the Installation Ceremony.
     When a Lord is to be deposed, his War Chief shall address 
him as follows:

     "So you, __________, disregard and set at naught the 
warnings of your women relatives.  So you fling the warnings 
over your shoulder to cast them behind you.
     "Behold the brightness of the Sun and in the brightness of 
the Sun's light I depose you of your title and remove the 
sacred emblem of your Lordship title.  I remove from your brow 
the deer's antlers, which was the emblem of your position and 
token of your nobility.  I now depose you and return the 
antlers to the women whose heritage they are."

     The War Chief shall now address the women of the deposed 
Lord and say:

     "Mothers, as I have now deposed your Lord, I now return to 
you the emblem and the title of Lordship, therefore repossess 
them."

     Again addressing himself to the deposed Lord he shall say:

     "As I have now deposed and discharged you so you are now 
no longer Lord.  You shall now go your way alone, the rest of 
the people of the Confederacy will not go with you, for we know 
not the kind of mind that possesses you.  As the Creator has 
nothing to do with wrong so he will not come to rescue you from 
the precipice of destruction in which you have cast yourself.  
You shall never be restored to the position which you once 
occupied."

     Then shall the War Chief address himself to the Lords of 
the Nation to which the deposed Lord belongs and say:

     "Know you, my Lords, that I have taken the deer's antlers 
from the brow of ___________, the emblem of his position and 
token of his greatness."

     The Lords of the Confederacy shall then have no other 
alternative than to sanction the discharge of the offending 
Lord.

20.  If a Lord of the Confederacy of the Five Nations should 
commit murder the other Lords of the Nation shall assemble at 
the place where the corpse lies and prepare to depose the 
criminal Lord.  If it is impossible to meet at the scene of the 
crime the Lords shall discuss the matter at the next Council of 
their Nation and request their War Chief to depose the Lord 
guilty of crime, to "bury" his women relatives and to transfer 
the Lordship title to a sister family. 
     The War Chief shall address the Lord guilty of murder and 
say:

     "So you, __________ (giving his name) did kill __________ 
(naming the slain man), with your own hands!  You have comitted 
a grave sin in the eyes of the Creator.  Behold the bright 
light of the Sun, and in the brightness of the Sun's light I 
depose you of your title and remove the horns, the sacred 
emblems of your Lordship title.  I remove from your brow the 
deer's antlers, which was the emblem of your position and token 
of your nobility.  I now depose you and expel you and you shall 
depart at once from the territory of the Five Nations 
Confederacy and nevermore return again.  We, the Five Nations 
Confederacy, moreover, bury your women relatives because the 
ancient Lordship title was never intended to have any union 
with bloodshed.  Henceforth it shall not be their heritage.  
By the evil deed that you have done they have forfeited it 
forever.."

     The War Chief shall then hand the title to a sister 
family and he shall address it and say:

     "Our mothers, ____________, listen attentively while I 
address you on a solemn and important subject.  I hereby 
transfer to you an ancient Lordship title for a great calamity 
has befallen it in the hands of the family of a former Lord.  
We trust that you, our mothers, will always guard it, and that 
you will warn your Lord always to be dutiful and to advise his 
people to ever live in love, poeace and harmony that a great 
calamity may never happen again."

21.  Certain physical defects in a Confederate Lord make him 
ineligible to sit in the Confederate Council.  Such defects are 
infancy, idiocy, blindness, deafness, dumbness and impotency.  
When a Confederate Lord is restricted by any of these 
condition, a deputy shall be appointed by his sponsors to act 
for him, but in case of extreme necessity the restricted Lord 
may exercise his rights.

22.  If a Confederate Lord desires to resign his title he shall 
notify the Lords of the Nation of which he is a member of his 
intention.  If his coactive Lords refuse to accept his 
resignation he may not resign his title.
     A Lord in proposing to resign may recommend any proper 
candidate which recommendation shall be received by the Lords, 
but unless confirmed and nominated by the women who hold the 
title the candidate so named shall not be considered.

23.  Any Lord of the Five Nations Confederacy may construct 
shell strings (or wampum belts) of any size or length as 
pledges or records of matters of national or international 
importance.
     When it is necessary to dispatch a shell string by a War 
Chief or other messenger as the token of a summons, the 
messenger shall recite the contents of the string to the party 
to whom it is sent.  That party shall repeat the message and 
return the shell string and if there has been a sumons he shall 
make ready for the journey.
     Any of the people of the Five Nations may use shells (or 
wampum) as the record of a pledge, contract or an agreement 
entered into and the same shall be binding as soon as shell 
strings shall have been exchanged by both parties.

24.  The Lords of the Confederacy of the Five Nations shall be 
mentors of the people for all time.  The thickness of their 
skin shall be seven spans -- which is to say that they shall 
be proof against anger, offensive actions and criticism.  Their 
hearts shall be full of peace and good will and their minds 
filled with a yearning for the welfare of the people of the 
Confederacy.  With endless patience they shall carry out their 
duty and their firmness shall be tempered with a tenderness for 
their people.  Neither anger nor fury shall find lodgement in 
their minds and all their words and actions shall be marked by 
calm deliberation. 

25.  If a Lord of the Confederacy should seek to establish any 
authority independent of the jurisdiction of the Confederacy of 
the Great Peace, which is the Five Nations, he shall be warned 
three times in open council, first by the women relatives, 
second by the men relatives and finally by the Lords of the 
Confederacy of the Nation to which he belongs.  If the 
offending Lord is still obdurate he shall be dismissed by the 
War Chief of his nation for refusing to conform to the laws of 
the Great Peace.  His nation shall then install the candidate 
nominated by the female name holders of his family.

26.  It shall be the duty of all of the Five Nations 
Confederate Lords, from time to time as occasion demands, to 
act as mentors and spiritual guides of their people and remind 
them of their Creator's will and words.  They shall say:

     "Hearken, that peace may continue unto future days!
     "Always listen to the words of the Great Creator, for he 
has spoken.
     "United people, let not evil find lodging in your minds.
     "For the Great Creator has spoken and the cause of Peace 
shall not become old.
     "The cause of peace shall not die if you remember the 
Great Creator."

     Every Confederate Lord shall speak words such as these to 
promote peace.

27.  All Lords of the Five Nations Confederacy must be honest 
in all things.  They must not idle or gossip, but be men 
possessing those honorable qualities that make true royaneh.  
It shall be a serious wrong for anyone to lead a Lord into 
trivial affairs, for the people must ever hold their Lords high 
in estimation out of respect to their honorable positions.

28.  When a candidate Lord is to be installed he shall furnish 
four strings of shells (or wampum) one span in length bound 
together at one end.  Such will constitute the evidence of his 
pledge to the Confederate Lords that he will live according to 
the constitution of the Great Peace and exercise justice in all 
affairs.
     When the pledge is furnished the Speaker of the Council 
must hold the shell strings in his hand and address the 
opposite side of the Council Fire and he shall commence his 
address saying: "Now behold him.  He has now become a 
Confederate Lord.  See how splendid he looks."  An address may 
then follow.  At the end of it he shall send the bunch of shell 
strings to the oposite side and they shall be received as 
evidence of the pledge.  Then shall the opposite side say:
     "We now do crown you with the sacred emblem of the deer's 
antlers, the emblem of your Lordship.  You shall now become a 
mentor of the people of the Five Nations.  The thickness of 
your skin shall be seven spans -- which is to say that you 
shall be proof against anger, offensive actions and criticism.  
Your heart shall be filled with peace and good will and your 
mind filled with a yearning for the welfare of the people of 
the Confederacy.  With endless patience you shall carry out 
your duty and your firmness shall be tempered with tenderness 
for your people.  Neither anger nor fury shall find lodgement 
in your mind and all your words and actions shall be marked 
with calm deliberation.  In all of your deliberations in the 
Confederate Council, in your efforts at law making, in all your 
official acts, self interest shall be cast into oblivion.  Cast 
not over your shoulder behind you the warnings of the nephews 
and nieces should they chide you for any error or wrong you may 
do, but return to the way of the Great Law which is just and 
right.  Look and listen for the welfare of the whole people and 
have always in view not only the present but also the coming 
generations, even those whose faces are yet beneath the surface 
of the ground -- the unborn of the future Nation."

29.  When a Lordship title is to be conferred, the candidate 
Lord shall furnish the cooked venison, the corn bread and the 
corn soup, together with other necessary things and the labor 
for the Conferring of Titles Festival.

30.  The Lords of the Confederacy may confer the Lordship title 
upon a candidate whenever the Great Law is recited, if there be 
a candidate, for the Great Law speaks all the rules.

31.  If a Lord of the Confederacy should become seriously ill 
and be thought near death, the women who are heirs of his title 
shall go to his house and lift his crown of deer antlers, the 
emblem of his Lordship, and place them at one side.  If the 
Creator spares him and he rises from his bed of sickness he may 
rise with the antlers on his brow.
     The following words shall be used to temporarily remove 
the antlers:

     "Now our comrade Lord (or our relative Lord) the time has 
come when we must approach you in your illness.  We remove for 
a time the deer's antlers from your brow, we remove the emblem 
of your Lordship title.  The Great Law has decreed that no Lord 
should end his life with the antlers on his brow.  We therefore 
lay them aside in the room.  If the Creator spares you and you 
recover from your illness you shall rise from your bed with the 
antlers on your brow as before and you shall resume your duties 
as Lord of the Confederacy and you may labor again for the 
Confederate people."

32.  If a Lord of the Confederacy should die while the Council 
of the Five Nations is in session the Council shall adjourn for 
ten days.  No Confederate Council shall sit within ten days of 
the death of a Lord of the Confederacy.
     If the Three Brothers (the Mohawk, the Onondaga and the 
Seneca) should lose one of their Lords by death, the Younger 
Brothers (the Oneida and the Cayuga) shall come to the 
surviving Lords of the Three Brothers on the tenth day and 
console them.  If the Younger Brothers lose one of their Lords 
then the Three Brothers shall come to them and console them.  
And the consolation shall be the reading of the contents of the 
thirteen shell (wampum) strings of Ayonhwhathah.  At the 
termination of this rite a successor shall be appointed, to be 
appointed by the women heirs of the Lordship title.  If the 
women are not yet ready to place their nominee before the Lords 
the Speaker shall say, "Come let us go out."  All shall leave 
the Council or the place of gathering.  The installation shall 
then wait until such a time as the women are ready.  The 
Speaker shall lead the way from the house by saying, "Let us 
depart to the edge of the woods and lie in waiting on our 
bellies."
     When the women title holders shall have chosen one of 
their sons the Confederate Lords will assemble in two places, 
the Younger Brothers in one place and the Three Older Brothers 
in another.  The Lords who are to console the mourning Lords 
shall choose one of their number to sing the Pacification Hymn 
as they journey to the sorrowing Lords.  The singer shall lead 
the way and the Lords and the people shall follow.  When they 
reach the sorrowing Lords they shall hail the candidate Lord 
and perform the rite of Conferring the Lordship Title.

33.  When a Confederate Lord dies, the surviving relatives 
shall immediately dispatch a messenger, a member of another 
clan, to the Lords in another locality.  When the runner comes 
within hailing distance of the locality he shall utter a sad 
wail, thus: "Kwa-ah, Kwa-ah, Kwa-ah!"  The sound shall be 
repeated three times and then again and again at intervals as 
many times as the distance may require.  When the runner 
arrives at the settlement the people shall assemble and one 
must ask him the nature of his sad message.  He shall then say, 
"Let us consider."  Then he shall tell them of the death of the 
Lord.  He shall deliver to them a string of shells (wampum) and 
say "Here is the testimony, you have heard the message."  He 
may then return home.
     It now becomes the duty of the Lords of the locality to 
send runners to other localities and each locality shall send 
other messengers until all Lords are notified.  Runners shall 
travel day and night.

34.  If a Lord dies and there is no candidate qualified for the 
office in the family of the women title holders, the Lords of 
the Nation shall give the title into the hands of a sister 
family in the clan until such a time as the original family 
produces a candidate, when the title shall be restored to the 
rightful owners.
     No Lordship title may be carried into the grave.  The 
Lords of the Confederacy may dispossess a dead Lord of his 
title even at the grave.


                  Election of Pine Tree Chiefs

35.  Should any man of the Nation assist with special ability 
or show great interest in the affairs of the Nation, if he 
proves himself wise, honest and worthy of confidence, the 
Confederate Lords may elect him to a seat with them and he may 
sit in the Confederate Council.  He shall be proclaimed a 'Pine 
Tree sprung up for the Nation' and shall be installed as such 
at the next assembly for the installation of Lords.  Should he 
ever do anything contrary to the rules of the Great Peace, he 
may not be deposed from office -- no one shall cut him down -- 
but thereafter everyone shall be deaf to his voice and his 
advice.  Should he resign his seat and title no one shall 
prevent him.  A Pine Tree chief has no authority to name a 
successor nor is his title hereditary.


              Names, Duties and Rights of War Chiefs

36.  The title names of the Chief Confederate Lords' War Chiefs 
shall be:

      Ayonwaehs, War Chief under Lord Takarihoken (Mohawk)
      Kahonwahdironh, War Chief under Lord Odatshedeh (Oneida)
      Ayendes, War Chief under Lord Adodarhoh (Onondaga)
      Wenenhs, War Chief under Lord Dekaenyonh (Cayuga)
      Shoneradowaneh, War Chief under Lord Skanyadariyo (Seneca)

     The women heirs of each head Lord's title shall be the 
heirs of the War Chief's title of their respective Lord.
     The War Chiefs shall be selected from the eligible sons of 
the female families holding the head Lordship titles.

37.  There shall be one War Chief for each Nation and their 
duties shall be to carry messages for their Lords and to take 
up the arms of war in case of emergency.  They shall not 
participate in the proceedings of the Confederate Council but 
shall watch its progress and in case of an erroneous action by 
a Lord they shall receive the complaints of the people and 
convey the warnings of the women to him.  The people who wish 
to convey messages to the Lords in the Confederate Council 
shall do so through the War Chief of their Nation.  It shall 
ever be his duty to lay the cases, questions and propositions 
of the people before the Confederate Council.

38.  When a War Chief dies another shall be installed by the 
same rite as that by which a Lord is installed.

39.  If a War Chief acts contrary to instructions or against 
the provisions of the Laws of the Great Peace, doing so in the 
capacity of his office, he shall be deposed by his women 
relatives and by his men relatives.  Either the women or the 
men alone or jointly may act in such a case.  The women title 
holders shall then choose another candidate.

40.  When the Lords of the Confederacy take occasion to 
dispatch a messenger in behalf of the Confederate Council, 
they shall wrap up any matter they may send and instruct the 
messenger to remember his errand, to turn not aside but to 
proceed faithfully to his destination and deliver his message 
according to every instruction.

41.  If a message borne by a runner is the warning of an 
invasion he shall whoop, "Kwa-ah, Kwa-ah," twice and repeat 
at short intervals; then again at a longer interval.
     If a human being is found dead, the finder shall not touch 
the body but return home immediately shouting at short 
intervals, "Koo-weh!"


                    Clans and Consanguinity

42.  Among the Five Nations and their posterity there shall be 
the following original clans: Great Name Bearer, Ancient Name 
Bearer, Great Bear, Ancient Bear, Turtle, Painted Turtle, 
Standing Rock, Large Plover, Deer, Pigeon Hawk, Eel, Ball, 
Opposite-Side-of-the-Hand, and Wild Potatoes.  These clans 
distributed through their respective Nations, shall be the sole 
owners and holders of the soil of the country and in them is it 
vested as a birthright.

43.  People of the Five Nations members of a certain clan shall 
recognize every other member of that clan, irrespective of the 
Nation, as relatives.  Men and women, therefore, members of the 
same clan are forbidden to marry.

44.  The lineal descent of the people of the Five Nations shall 
run in the female line.  Women shall be considered the 
progenitors of the Nation.  They shall own the land and the 
soil.  Men and women shall follow the status of the mother.

45.  The women heirs of the Confederated Lordship titles shall 
be called Royaneh (Noble) for all time to come.

46.  The women of the Forty Eight (now fifty) Royaneh families 
shall be the heirs of the Authorized Names for all time to come.
     When an infant of the Five Nations is given an Authorized 
Name at the Midwinter Festival or at the Ripe Corn Festival, 
one in the cousinhood of which the infant is a member shall be 
appointed a speaker.  He shall then announce to the opposite 
cousinhood the names of the father and the mother of the child 
together with the clan of the mother.  Then the speaker shall 
announce the child's name twice.  The uncle of the child shall 
then take the child in his arms and walking up and down the 
room shall sing: "My head is firm, I am of the Confederacy."  
As he sings the opposite cousinhood shall respond by chanting, 
"Hyenh, Hyenh, Hyenh, Hyenh," until the song is ended.

47.  If the female heirs of a Confederate Lord's title become 
extinct, the title right shall be given by the Lords of the 
Confederacy to the sister family whom they shall elect and that 
family shall hold the name and transmit it to their (female) 
heirs, but they shall not appoint any of their sons as a 
candidate for a title until all the eligible men of the former 
family shall have died or otherwise have become ineligible.

48.  If all the heirs of a Lordship title become extinct, and 
all the families in the clan, then the title shall be given by 
the Lords of the Confederacy to the family in a sister clan 
whom they shall elect.

49.  If any of the Royaneh women, heirs of a titleship, shall 
wilfully withhold a Lordship or other title and refuse to 
bestow it, or if such heirs abandon, forsake or despise their 
heritage, then shall such women be deemed buried and their 
family extinct.  The titleship shall then revert to a sister 
family or clan upon application and complaint.  The Lords of 
the Confederacy shall elect the family or clan which shall in 
future hold the title.

50.  The Royaneh women of the Confederacy heirs of the Lordship 
titles shall elect two women of their family as cooks for the 
Lord when the people shall assemble at his house for business 
or other purposes.
     It is not good nor honorable for a Confederate Lord to 
allow his people whom he has called to go hungry.

51.  When a Lord holds a conference in his home, his wife, if 
she wishes, may prepare the food for the Union Lords who 
assemble with him.  This is an honorable right which she may 
exercise and an expression of her esteem.

52.  The Royaneh women, heirs of the Lordship titles, shall, 
should it be necessary, correct and admonish the holders of 
their titles.  Those only who attend the Council may do this 
and those who do not shall not object to what has been said nor 
strive to undo the action.

53.  When the Royaneh women, holders of a Lordship title, 
select one of their sons as a candidate, they shall select one 
who is trustworthy, of good character, of honest disposition, 
one who manages his own affairs, supports his own family, if 
any, and who has proven a faithful man to his Nation.

54.  When a Lordship title becomes vacant through death or 
other cause, the Royaneh women of the clan in which the title 
is hereditary shall hold a council and shall choose one from 
among their sons to fill the office made vacant.  Such a 
candidate shall not be the father of any Confederate Lord.  
If the choice is unanimous the name is referred to the men 
relatives of the clan.  If they should disapprove it shall be 
their duty to select a candidate from among their own number.  
If then the men and women are unable to decide which of the two 
candidates shall be named, then the matter shall be referred to 
the Confederate Lords in the Clan.  They shall decide which 
candidate shall be named.  If the men and the women agree to a 
candidate his name shall be referred to the sister clans for 
confirmation.  If the sister clans confirm the choice, they 
shall refer their action to their Confederate Lords who shall 
ratify the choice and present it to their cousin Lords, and if 
the cousin Lords confirm the name then the candidate shall be 
installed by the proper ceremony for the conferring of Lordship 
titles.


                     Official Symbolism

55.  A large bunch of shell strings, in the making of which the 
Five Nations Confederate Lords have equally contributed, shall 
symbolize the completeness of the union and certify the pledge 
of the nations represented by the Confederate Lords of the 
Mohawk, the Oneida, the Onondaga, the Cayuga and the Senecca, 
that all are united and formed into one body or union called 
the Union of the Great Law, which they have established.
     A bunch of shell strings is to be the symbol of the 
council fire of the Five Nations Confederacy.  And the Lord 
whom the council of Fire Keepers shall appoint to speak for 
them in opening the council shall hold the strands of shells 
in his hands when speaking.  When he finishes speaking he shall 
deposit the strings on an elevated place (or pole) so that all 
the assembled Lords and the people may see it and know that the 
council is open and in progress.
     When the council adjourns the Lord who has been appointed 
by his comrade Lords to close it shall take the strands of 
shells in his hands and address the assembled Lords.  Thus will 
the council adjourn until such time and place as appointed by 
the council.  Then shall the shell strings be placed in a place 
for safekeeping.
     Every five years the Five Nations Confederate Lords and 
the people shall assemble together and shall ask one another if 
their minds are still in the same spirit of unity for the Great 
Binding Law and if any of the Five Nations shall not pledge 
continuance and steadfastness to the pledge of unity then the 
Great Binding Law shall dissolve.

56.  Five strings of shell tied together as one shall represent 
the Five Nations.  Each string shall represent one territory 
and the whole a completely united territory known as the Five 
Nations Confederate territory.

57.  Five arrows shall be bound together very strong and each 
arrow shall represent one nation.  As the five arrows are 
strongly bound this shall symbolize the complete union of the 
nations.  Thus are the Five Nations united completely and 
enfolded together, united into one head, one body and one 
mind.  Therefore they shall labor, legislate and council 
together  for the interest of future generations.
     The Lords of the Confederacy shall eat together from one 
bowl the feast of cooked beaver's tail.  While they are eating 
they are to use no sharp utensils for if they should they might 
accidentally cut one another and bloodshed would follow.  All 
measures must be taken to prevent the spilling of blood in any 
way.

58.  There are now the Five Nations Confederate Lords standing 
with joined hands in a circle.  This signifies and provides 
that should any one of the Confederate Lords leave the council 
and this Confederacy his crown of deer's horns, the emblem of 
his Lordship title, together with his birthright, shall lodge 
on the arms of the Union Lords whose hands are so joined.  He 
forfeits his title and the crown falls from his brow but it 
shall remain in the Confederacy.
     A further meaning of this is that if any time any one of 
the Confederate Lords choose to submit to the law of a foreign 
people he is no longer in but out of the Confederacy, and 
persons of this class shall be called "They have alienated 
themselves."  Likewise such persons who submit to laws of 
foreign nations shall forfeit all birthrights and claims on 
the Five Nations Confederacy and territory.
     You, the Five Nations Confederate Lords, be firm so that 
if a tree falls on your joined arms it shall not separate or 
weaken your hold.  So shall the strength of the union be 
preserved.

59.  A bunch of wampum shells on strings, three spans of the 
hand in length, the upper half of the bunch being white and the 
lower half black, and formed from equal contributions of the 
men of the Five Nations, shall be a token that the men have 
combined themselves into one head, one body and one thought, 
and it shall also symbolize their ratification of the peace 
pact of the Confederacy, whereby the Lords of the Five Nations 
have established the Great Peace.
     The white portion of the shell strings represent the women 
and the black portion the men.  The black portion, furthermore, 
is a token of power and authority vested in the men of the Five 
Nations.
     This string of wampum vests the people with the right to 
correct their erring Lords.  In case a part or all the Lords 
pursue a course not vouched for by the people and heed not the 
third warning of their women relatives, then the matter shall 
be taken to the General Council of the women of the Five 
Nations.  If the Lords notified and warned three times fail to 
heed, then the case falls into the hands of the men of the Five 
Nations.  The War Chiefs shall then, by right of such power and 
authority, enter the open concil to warn the Lord or Lords to 
return from the wrong course.  If the Lords heed the warning 
they shall say, "we will reply tomorrow."  If then an answer is 
returned in favor of justice and in accord with this Great Law, 
then the Lords shall individualy pledge themselves again by 
again furnishing the necessary shells for the pledge.  Then 
shall the War Chief or Chiefs exhort the Lords urging them to 
be just and true.
     Should it happen that the Lords refuse to heed the third 
warning, then two courses are open: either the men may decide 
in their council to depose the Lord or Lords or to club them to 
death with war clubs.  Should they in their council decide to 
take the first course the War Chief shall address the Lord or 
Lords, saying:  "Since you the Lords of the Five Nations have 
refused to return to the procedure of the Constitution, we now 
declare your seats vacant, we take off your horns, the token of 
your Lordship, and others shall be chosen and installed in your 
seats, therefore vacate your seats."
     Should the men in their council adopt the second course, 
the War Chief shall order his men to enter the council, to take 
positions beside the Lords, sitting bewteen them wherever 
possible.  When this is accomplished the War Chief holding in 
his outstretched hand a bunch of black wampum strings shall say 
to the erring Lords: "So now, Lords of the Five United Nations, 
harken to these last words from your men.  You have not heeded 
the warnings of the women relatives, you have not heeded the 
warnings of the General Council of women and you have not 
heeded the warnings of the men of the nations, all urging you 
to return to the right course of action.  Since you are 
determined to resist and to withhold justice from your people 
there is only one course for us to adopt."  At this point the 
War Chief shall let drop the bunch of black wampum and the men 
shall spring to their feet and club the erring Lords to death.  
Any erring Lord may submit before the War Chief lets fall the 
black wampum.  Then his execution is withheld.
     The black wampum here used symbolizes that the power to 
execute is buried but that it may be raised up again by the 
men.  It is buried but when occasion arises they may pull it 
up and derive their power and authority to act as here 
described.

60.  A broad dark belt of wampum of thirty-eight rows, having a 
white heart in the center, on either side of which are two 
white squares all connected with the heart by white rows of 
beads shall be the emblem of the unity of the Five Nations.
    [ ed note: This is the Hiawatha Belt, now in the
               Congressional Library. ] 
     The first of the squares on the left represents the Mohawk 
nation and its territory; the second square on the left and the 
one near the heart, represents the Oneida nation and its 
territory; the white heart in the middle represents the 
Onondaga nation and its territory, and it also means that the 
heart of the Five Nations is single in its loyalty to the Great 
Peace, that the Great Peace is lodged in the heart (meaning the 
Onondaga Lords), and that the Council Fire is to burn there for 
the Five Nations, and further, it means that the authority is 
given to advance the cause of peace whereby hostile nations out 
of the Confederacy shall cease warfare; the white square to the 
right of the heart represents the Cayuga nation and its 
territory and the fourth and last white square represents the 
Seneca nation and its territory.
     White shall here symbolize that no evil or jealous 
thoughts shall creep into the minds of the Lords while in 
Council under the Great Peace.  White, the emblem of peace, 
love, charity and equity surrounds and guards the Five Nations. 

61.  Should a great calamity threaten the generations rising 
and living of the Five United Nations, then he who is able to 
climb to the top of the Tree of the Great Long Leaves may do 
so.  When, then, he reaches the top of the tree he shall look 
about in all directions, and, should he see that evil things 
indeed are approaching, then he shall call to the people of the 
Five United Nations assembled beneath the Tree of the Great 
Long Leaves and say: "A calamity threatens your happiness."
     Then shall the Lords convene in council and discuss the 
impending evil.
     When all the truths relating to the trouble shall be 
fully known and found to be truths, then shall the people seek 
out a Tree of Ka-hon-ka-ah-go-nah, [ a great swamp Elm ], and 
when they shall find it they shall assemble their heads 
together and lodge for a time between its roots.  Then, their 
labors being finished, they may hope for happiness for many 
days after.

62.  When the Confederate Council of the Five Nations declares 
for a reading of the belts of shell calling to mind these laws, 
they shall provide for the reader a specially made mat woven of 
the fibers of wild hemp.  The mat shall not be used again, for 
such formality is called the honoring of the importance of the 
law.

63.  Should two sons of opposite sides of the council fire 
agree in a desire to hear the reciting of the laws of the 
Great Peace and so refresh their memories in the way ordained 
by the founder of the Confederacy, they shall notify Adodarho.  
He then shall consult with five of his coactive Lords and they 
in turn shall consult with their eight brethern.  Then should 
they decide to accede to the request of the two sons from 
opposite sides of the Council Fire, Adodarho shall send 
messengers to notify the Chief Lords of each of the Five 
Nations.  Then they shall despatch their War Chiefs to notify 
their brother and cousin Lords of the meeting and its time and 
place.
     When all have come and have assembled, Adodarhoh, in 
conjunction with his cousin Lords, shall appoint one Lord who 
shall repeat the laws of the Great Peace.  Then shall they 
announce who they have chosen to repeat the laws of the Great 
Peace to the two sons.  Then shall the chosen one repeat the 
laws of the Great Peace.

64.  At the ceremony of the installation of Lords if there is 
only one expert speaker and singer of the law and the 
Pacification Hymn to stand at the council fire, then when this 
speaker and singer has finished addressing one side of the fire 
he shall go to the oposite side and reply to his own speech and 
song.  He shall thus act for both sidesa of the fire until the 
entire ceremony has been completed.  Such a speaker and singer 
shall be termed the "Two Faced" because he speaks and sings for 
both sides of the fire.

65.  I, Dekanawida, and the Union Lords, now uproot the tallest 
pine tree and into the cavity thereby made we cast all weapons 
of war.  Into the depths of the earth, down into the deep 
underearth currents of water flowing to unknown regions we cast 
all the weapons of strife.  We bury them from sight and we 
plant again the tree.  Thus shall the Great Peace be 
established and hostilities shall no longer be known between 
the Five Nations but peace to the United People.


                   Laws of Adoption

66.  The father of a child of great comliness, learning, 
ability or specially loved because of some circumstance may, at 
the will of the child's clan, select a name from his own (the 
father's) clan and bestow it by ceremony, such as is provided.  
This naming shall be only temporary and shall be called, "A 
name hung about the neck."

67.  Should any person, a member of the Five Nations' 
Confederacy, specially esteem a man or woman of another clan or 
of a foreign nation, he may choose a name and bestow it upon 
that person so esteemed.  The naming shall be in accord with 
the ceremony of bestowing names.  Such a name is only a 
temporary one and shall be called "A name hung about the 
neck."  A short string of shells shall be delivered with the 
name as a record and a pledge.

68.  Should any member of the Five Nations, a family or person 
belonging to a foreign nation submit a proposal for adoption 
into a clan of one of the Five Nations, he or they shall 
furnish a string of shells, a span in length, as a pledge to 
the clan into which he or they wish to be adopted.  The Lords 
of the nation shall then consider the proposal and submit a 
decision.

69.  Any member of the Five Nations who through esteem or other 
feeling wishes to adopt an individual, a family or number of 
families may offer adoption to him or them and if accepted the 
matter shall be brought to the attention of the Lords for 
confirmation and the Lords must confirm adoption.

70.  When the adoption of anyone shall have been confirmed by 
the Lords of the Nation, the Lords shall address the people of 
their nation and say: "Now you of our nation, be informed that 
such a person, such a family or such families have ceased 
forever to bear their birth nation's name and have buried it in 
the depths of the earth.  Henceforth let no one of our nation 
ever mention the original name or nation of their birth.  To do 
so will be to hasten the end of our peace.


                      Laws of Emigration

71.  When any person or family belonging to the Five Nations 
desires to abandon their birth nation and the territory of the 
Five Nations, they shall inform the Lords of their nation and 
the Confederate Council of the Five Nations shall take 
cognizance of it.

72.  When any person or any of the people of the Five Nations 
emigrate and reside in a region distant from the territory of 
the Five Nations Confederacy, the Lords of the Five Nations at 
will may send a messenger carrying a broad belt of black shells 
and when the messenger arrives he shall call the people 
together or address them personally displaying the belt of 
shells and they shall know that this is an order for them to 
return to their original homes and to their council fires.


                  Rights of Foreign Nations

73.  The soil of the earth from one end of the land to the 
other is the property of the people who inhabit it.  By 
birthright the Ongwehonweh (Original beings) are the owners 
of the soil which they own and occupy and none other may hold 
it.  The same law has been held from the oldest times.
     The Great Creator has made us of the one blood and of the 
same soil he made us and as only different tongues constitute 
different nations he established different hunting grounds and 
territories and made boundary lines between them. 

74.  When any alien nation or individual is admitted into the 
Five Nations the admission shall be understood only to be a 
temporary one.  Should the person or nation create loss, do 
wrong or cause suffering of any kind to endanger the peace of 
the Confederacy, the Confederate Lords shall order one of their 
war chiefs to reprimand him or them and if a similar offence is 
again committed the offending party or parties shall be 
expelled from the territory of the Five United Nations.

75.  When a member of an alien nation comes to the territory 
of the Five Nations and seeks refuge and permanent residence, 
the Lords of the Nation to which he comes shall extend 
hospitality and make him a member of the nation.  Then shall he 
be accorded equal rights and privileges in all matters except 
as after mentioned.

76.  No body of alien people who have been adopted temporarily 
shall have a vote in the council of the Lords of the 
Confederacy, for only they who have been invested with Lordship 
titles may vote in the Council.  Aliens have nothing by blood 
to make claim to a vote and should they have it, not knowing 
all the traditions of the Confederacy, might go against its 
Great Peace.  In this manner the Great Peace would be 
endangered and perhaps be destroyed.

77.  When the Lords of the Confederacy decide to admit a 
foreign nation and an adoption is made, the Lords shall inform 
the adopted nation that its admission is only temporary.  They 
shall also say to the nation that it must never try to control, 
to interfere with or to injure the Five Nations nor disregard 
the Great Peace or any of its rules or customs.  That in no way 
should they cause disturbance or injury.  Then should the 
adopted nation disregard these injunctions, their adoption 
shall be annuled and they shall be expelled.
     The expulsion shall be in the following manner:  The 
council shall appoint one of their War Chiefs to convey the 
message of annulment and he shall say, "You (naming the nation) 
listen to me while I speak.  I am here to inform you again of 
the will of the Five Nations' Council.  It was clearly made 
known to you at a former time.  Now the Lords of the Five 
Nations have decided to expel you and cast you out.  We disown 
you now and annul your adoption.  Therefore you must look for a 
path in which to go and lead away all your people.  It was you, 
not we, who committed wrong and caused this sentence of 
annulment.  So then go your way and depart from the territory 
of the Five Nations and from the Confederacy."

78.  Whenever a foreign nation enters the Confederacy or 
accepts the Great Peace, the Five Nations and the foreign 
nation shall enter into an agreement and compact by which the 
foreign nation shall endeavor to pursuade other nations to 
accept the Great Peace.


                   Rights and Powers of War

79.  Skanawatih shall be vested with a double office, duty and 
with double authority.  One-half of his being shall hold the 
Lordship title and the other half shall hold the title of War 
Chief.  In the event of war he shall notify the five War Chiefs 
of the Confederacy and command them to prepare for war and have 
their men ready at the appointed time and place for engagement 
with the enemy of the Great Peace.

80.  When the Confederate Council of the Five Nations has for 
its object the establishment of the Great Peace among the 
people of an outside nation and that nation refuses to accept 
the Great Peace, then by such refusal they bring a declaration 
of war upon themselves from the Five Nations.  Then shall the 
Five Nations seek to establish the Great Peace by a conquest 
of the rebellious nation.

81.  When the men of the Five Nations, now called forth to 
become warriors, are ready for battle with an obstinate 
opposing nation that has refused to accept the Great Peace, 
then one of the five War Chiefs shall be chosen by the warriors 
of the Five Nations to lead the army into battle.  It shall be 
the duty of the War Chief so chosen to come before his warriors 
and address them.  His aim shall be to impress upon them the 
necessity of good behavior and strict obedience to all the 
commands of the War Chiefs.  He shall deliver an oration 
exhorting them with great zeal to be brave and courageous and 
never to be guilty of cowardice.  At the conclusion of his 
oration he shall march forward and commence the War Song and he 
shall sing:

        Now I am greatly surprised
     And, therefore I shall use it --
     The power of my War Song.
        I am of the Five Nations
     And I shall make supplication
     To the Almighty Creator.
     He has furnished this army.
     My warriors shall be mighty
     In the strength of the Creator.
     Between him and my song they are
     For it was he who gave the song
     This war song that I sing!

82.  When the warriors of the Five Nations are on an 
expedition against an enemy, the War Chief shall sing the War 
Song as he approaches the country of the enemy and not cease 
until his scouts have reported that the army is near the 
enemies' lines when the War Chief shall approach with great 
caution and prepare for the attack.

83.  When peace shall have been established by the termination 
of the war against a foreign nation, then the War Chief shall 
cause all the weapons of war to be taken from the nation.  Then 
shall the Great Peace be established and that nation shall 
observe all the rules of the Great Peace for all time to come.

84.  Whenever a foreign nation is conquered or has by their 
own will accepted the Great Peace their own system of internal 
government may continue, but they must cease all warfare 
against other nations.

85.  Whenever a war against a foreign nation is pushed until 
that nation is about exterminated because of its refusal to 
accept the Great Peace and if that nation shall by its obstinacy 
become exterminated, all their rights, property and territory 
shall become the property of the Five Nations.

86.  Whenever a foreign nation is conquered and the survivors 
are brought into the territory of the Five Nations' Confederacy 
and placed under the Great Peace the two shall be known as the 
Conqueror and the Conquered.  A symbolic relationship shall be 
devised and be placed in some symbolic position.  The conquered 
nation shall have no voice in the councils of the Confederacy 
in the body of the Lords.

87.  When the War of the Five Nations on a foreign rebellious 
nation is ended, peace shall be restored to that nation by a 
withdrawal of all their weapons of war by the War Chief of the 
Five Nations.  When all the terms of peace shall have been 
agreed upon a state of friendship shall be established.

88.  When the proposition to establish the Great Peace is 
made to a foreign nation it shall be done in mutual council.  
The foreign nation is to be persuaded by reason and urged to 
come into the Great Peace.  If the Five Nations fail to obtain 
the consent of the nation at the first council a second council 
shall be held and upon a second failure a third council shall 
be held and this third council shall end the peaceful methods 
of persuasion.  At the third council the War Chief of the Five 
nations shall address the Chief of the foreign nation and 
request him three times to accept the Great Peace.  If refusal 
steadfastly follows the War Chief shall let the bunch of white 
lake shells drop from his outstretched hand to the ground and 
shall bound quickly forward and club the offending chief to 
death.  War shall thereby be declared and the War Chief shall 
have his warriors at his back to meet any emergency.  War must 
continue until the contest is won by the Five Nations.

89.  When the Lords of the Five Nations propose to meet in 
conference with a foreign nation with proposals for an 
acceptance of the Great Peace, a large band of warriors shall 
conceal themselves in a secure place safe from the espionage 
of the foreign nation but as near at hand as possible.  Two 
warriors shall accompany the Union Lord who carries the 
proposals and these warriors shall be especially cunning.  
Should the Lord be attacked, these warriors shall hasten back 
to the army of warriors with the news of the calamity which 
fell through the treachery of the foreign nation.

90.  When the Five Nations' Council declares war any Lord of 
the Confederacy may enlist with the warriors by temporarily 
renouncing his sacred Lordship title which he holds through the 
election of his women relatives.  The title then reverts to 
them and they may bestow it upon another temporarily until the 
war is over when the Lord, if living, may resume his title and 
seat in the Council.

91.  A certain wampum belt of black beads shall be the emblem 
of the authority of the Five War Chiefs to take up the weapons 
of war and with their men to resist invasion.  This shall be 
called a war in defense of the territory.


                Treason or Secession of a Nation

92.  If a nation, part of a nation, or more than one nation 
within the Five Nations should in any way endeavor to destroy 
the Great Peace by neglect or violating its laws and resolve to 
dissolve the Confederacy, such a nation or such nations shall 
be deemed guilty of treason and called enemies of the 
Confederacy and the Great Peace.
     It shall then be the duty of the Lords of the Confederacy 
who remain faithful to resolve to warn the offending people.  
They shall be warned once and if a second warning is necessary 
they shall be driven from the territory of the Confederacy by 
the War Chiefs and his men.


            Rights of the People of the Five Nations

93.  Whenever a specially important matter or a great emergency 
is presented before the Confederate Council and the nature of 
the matter affects the entire body of the Five Nations, 
threatening their utter ruin, then the Lords of the Confederacy 
must submit the matter to the decision of their people and the 
decision of the people shall affect the decision of the 
Confederate Council.  This decision shall be a confirmation of 
the voice of the people.

94.  The men of every clan of the Five Nations shall have a 
Council Fire ever burning in readiness for a council of the 
clan.  When it seems necessary for a council to be held to 
discuss the welfare of the clans, then the men may gather 
about the fire.  This council shall have the same rights 
as the council of the women.

95.  The women of every clan of the Five Nations shall have 
a Council Fire ever burning in readiness for a council of the 
clan.  When in their opinion it seems necessary for the 
interest of the people they shall hold a council and their 
decisions and recommendations shall be introduced before the 
Council of the Lords by the War Chief for its consideration.

96.  All the Clan council fires of a nation or of the Five 
Nations may unite into one general council fire, or delegates 
from all the council fires may be appointeed to unite in a 
general council for discussing the interests of the people.  
The people shall have the right to make appointments and to 
delegate their power to others of their number.  When their 
council shall have come to a conclusion on any matter, their 
decision shall be reported to the Council of the Nation or to 
the Confederate Council (as the case may require) by the War 
Chief or the War Chiefs.

97.  Before the real people united their nations, each nation 
had its council fires.  Before the Great Peace their councils 
were held.  The five Council Fires shall continue to burn as 
before and they are not quenched.  The Lords of each nation in 
future shall settle their nation's affairs at this council fire 
governed always by the laws and rules of the council of the 
Confederacy and by the Great Peace.

98.  If either a nephew or a niece see an irregularity in the 
performance of the functions of the Great Peace and its laws, 
in the Confederate Council or in the conferring of Lordship 
titles in an improper way, through their War Chief they may 
demand that such actions become subject to correction and that 
the matter conform to the ways prescribed by the laws of the 
Great Peace.


                Religious Ceremonies Protected

99.  The rites and festivals of each nation shall remain 
undisturbed and shall continue as before because they were 
given by the people of old times as useful and necessary 
for the good of men.

100.  It shall be the duty of the Lords of each brotherhood 
to confer at the approach of the time of the Midwinter 
Thanksgiving and to notify their people of the approaching 
festival.  They shall hold a council over the matter and 
arrange its details and begin the Thanksgiving five days 
after the moon of Dis-ko-nah is new.  The people shall 
assemble at the appointed place and the nephews shall notify 
the people of the time and place.  From the beginning to 
the end the Lords shall preside over the Thanksgiving and 
address the people from time to time.

101.  It shall be the duty of the appointed managers of the 
Thanksgiving festivals to do all that is needed for carrying 
out the duties of the occasions.
      The recognized festivals of Thanksgiving shall be the 
Midwinter Thanksgiving, the Maple or Sugar-making Thanksgiving, 
the Raspberry Thanksgiving, the Strawberry Thanksgiving, the 
Cornplanting Thanksgiving, the Corn Hoeing Thanksgiving, the 
Little Festival of Green Corn, the Great Festival of Ripe Corn 
and the complete Thanksgiving for the Harvest.
      Each nation's festivals shall be held in their Long 
Houses.

102.  When the Thansgiving for the Green Corn comes the 
special managers, both the men and women, shall give it 
careful attention and do their duties properly.

103.  When the Ripe Corn Thanksgiving is celebrated the Lords 
of the Nation must give it the same attention as they give 
to the Midwinter Thanksgiving.

104.  Whenever any man proves himself by his good life and his 
knowledge of good things, naturally fitted as a teacher of good 
things, he shall be recognized by the Lords as a teacher of 
peace and religion and the people shall hear him.


                  The Installation Song

105.  The song used in installing the new Lord of the 
Confederacy shall be sung by Adodarhoh and it shall be:

      "Haii, haii Agwah wi-yoh
        "     "   A-kon-he-watha
        "     "   Ska-we-ye-se-go-wah
        "     "   Yon-gwa-wih
        "     "   Ya-kon-he-wa-tha

       Haii, haii It is good indeed
        "     "   (That) a broom, --
        "     "   A great wing,
        "     "   It is given me
        "     "   For a sweeping instrument."

106.  Whenever a person properly entitled desires to learn the 
Pacification Song he is privileged to do so but he must prepare 
a feast at which his teachers may sit with him and sing.  The 
feast is provided that no misfortune may befall them for 
singing the song on an occasion when no chief is installed.


                   Protection of the House

107.  A certain sign shall be known to all the people of the 
Five Nations which shall denote that the owner or occupant of 
a house is absent.  A stick or pole in a slanting or leaning 
position shall indicate this and be the sign.  Every person not 
entitled to enter the house by right of living within it upon 
seeing such a sign shall not approach the house either by day 
or by night but shall keep as far away as his business will 
permit.


                      Funeral Addresses

108.  At the funeral of a Lord of the Confederacy, say:  Now we 
become reconciled as you start away.  You were once a Lord of 
the Five Nations' Confederacy and the United People trusted 
you. Now we release you for it is true that it is no longer 
possible for us to walk about together on the earth.  Now, 
therefore, we lay it (the body) here.  Here we lay it away.  
Now then we say to you, 'Persevere onward to the place where 
the Creator dwells in peace.  Let not the things of the earth 
hinder you.  Let nothing that transpired while yet you lived 
hinder you.  In hunting you once took delight; in the game of 
Lacrosse you once took delight and in the feasts and pleasant 
occasions your mind was amused, but now do not allow thoughts 
of these things to give you trouble.  Let not your relatives 
hinder you and also let not your friends and associates trouble 
your mind.  Regard none of these things.'
      "Now then, in turn, you here present who were related to 
this man and you who were his friends and associates, behold 
the path that is yours also!  Soon we ourselves will be left 
in that place.  For this reason hold yourselves in restraint 
as you go from place to place.  In your actions and in your 
conversation do no idle thing.  Speak not idle talk neither 
gossip.  Be careful of this and speak not and do not give way 
to evil behavior.  One year is the time that you must abstain 
from unseemly levity but if you can not do this for ceremony, 
ten days is the time to regard these things for respect."

109.  At the funeral of a War Chief, say:
      "Now we become reconciled as you start away.  You were 
once a War Chief of the Five Nations' Confederacy and the 
United People trusted you as their guard from the enemy."  
(The remainder is the same as the address at the funeral 
of a Lord).

110.  At the funeral of a Warrior, say:
      "Now we become reconciled as you start away.  Once you 
were a devoted provider and protector of your family and you 
were ever ready to take part in battles for the Five Nations' 
Confederacy.  The United People trusted you."  (The remainder
is the same as the address at the funeral of a Lord).

111.  At the funeral of a young man, say:
      "Now we become reconciled as you start away.  In the 
beginning of your career you are taken away and the flower of 
your life is withered away."  (The remainder is the same as the 
address at the funeral of a Lord).

112.  At the funeral of a chief woman, say:
      "Now we become reconciled as you start away.  You were 
once a chief woman in the Five Nations' Confederacy.  You once 
were a mother of the nations.  Now we release you for it is 
true that it is no longer possible for us to walk about 
together on the earth.  Now, therefore, we lay it (the body) 
here.  Here we lay it away.  Now then we say to you, 'Persevere 
onward to the place where the Creator dwells in peace.  Let not 
the things of the earth hinder you.  Let nothing that 
transpired while you lived hinder you.  Looking after your 
family was a sacred duty and you were faithful.  You were one 
of the many joint heirs of the Lordship titles.  Feastings were 
yours and you had pleasant occasions. . ."  (The remainder is 
the same as the address at the funeral of a Lord).

113.  At the funeral of a woman of the people, say:
      "Now we become reconciled as you start away.  You were 
once a woman in the flower of life and the bloom is now 
withered away.  You once held a sacred position as a mother 
of the nation. (Etc.)  Looking after your family was a sacred 
duty and you were faithful.  Feastings . . . (etc.)"  (The 
remainder is the same as the address at the funeral of a Lord).

114.  At the funeral of an infant or young woman, say:
      "Now we become reconciled as you start away.  You were a 
tender bud and gladdened our hearts for only a few days.  Now 
the bloom has withered away . . . (etc.)  Let none of the 
things that transpired on earth hinder you.  Let nothing that 
happened while you lived hinder you."  (The remainder is the 
same as the address at the funeral of a Lord).

[ Editors note:  the above ellipses and 'etc.' remarks are 
transcribed directly from the text I copied. ]

115.  When an infant dies within three days, mourning shall 
continue only five days.  Then shall you gather the little boys 
and girls at the house of mourning and at the funeral feast a 
speaker shall address the children and bid them be happy once 
more, though by a death, gloom has been cast over them.  Then 
shall the black clouds roll away and the sky shall show blue 
once more.  Then shall the children be again in sunshine.

116.  When a dead person is brought to the burial place, the 
speaker on the opposite side of the Council Fire shall bid the 
bereaved family cheer their minds once again and rekindle their 
hearth fires in peace, to put their house in order and once 
again be in brightness for darkness has covered them.  He shall 
say that the black clouds shall roll away and that the bright 
blue sky is visible once more.  Therefore shall they be in 
peace in the sunshine again.

117.  Three strings of shell one span in length shall be 
employed in addressing the assemblage at the burial of the 
dead.  The speaker shall say:
      "Hearken you who are here, this body is to be covered.  
Assemble in this place again ten days hence for it is the 
decree of the Creator that mourning shall cease when ten days 
have expired.  Then shall a feast be made."
       Then at the expiration of ten days the speaker shall say:
"Continue to listen you who are here.  The ten days of mourning 
have expired and your minds must now be freed of sorrow as 
before the loss of a relative.  The relatives have decided to 
make a little compensation to those who have assisted at the 
funeral.  It is a mere expression of thanks.  This is to the 
one who did the cooking while the body was lying in the house.  
Let her come forward and receive this gift and be dismissed 
from the task."  In substance this shall be repeated for every 
one who assisted in any way until all have been remembered.

(The Great Charter)





Preamble:



John, by the grace of God, king of England, lord of Ireland, duke of

Normandy and Aquitaine, and count of Anjou, to the archbishop, bishops,

abbots, earls, barons, justiciaries, foresters, sheriffs, stewards,

servants, and to all his bailiffs and liege subjects, greetings. Know

that, having regard to God and for the salvation of our soul, and those

of all our ancestors and heirs, and unto the honor of God and the

advancement of his holy Church and for the rectifying of our realm, we

have granted as underwritten by advice of our venerable fathers,

Stephen, archbishop of Canterbury, primate of all England and cardinal

of the holy Roman Church, Henry, archbishop of Dublin, William of

London, Peter of Winchester, Jocelyn of Bath and Glastonbury, Hugh of

Lincoln, Walter of Worcester, William of Coventry, Benedict of

Rochester, bishops; of Master Pandulf, subdeacon and member of the

household of our lord the Pope, of brother Aymeric (master of the

Knights of the Temple in England), and of the illustrious men William

Marshal, earl of Pembroke, William, earl of Salisbury, William, earl of

Warenne, William, earl of Arundel, Alan of Galloway (constable of

Scotland), Waren Fitz Gerold, Peter Fitz Herbert, Hubert De Burgh

(seneschal of Poitou), Hugh de Neville, Matthew Fitz Herbert, Thomas

Basset, Alan Basset, Philip d'Aubigny, Robert of Roppesley, John

Marshal, John Fitz Hugh, and others, our liegemen.



1. In the first place we have granted to God, and by this our present

charter confirmed for us and our heirs forever that the English Church

shall be free, and shall have her rights entire, and her liberties

inviolate; and we will that it be thus observed; which is apparent from

this that the freedom of elections, which is reckoned most important and

very essential to the English Church, we, of our pure and unconstrained

will, did grant, and did by our charter confirm and did obtain the

ratification of the same from our lord, Pope Innocent III, before the

quarrel arose between us and our barons: and this we will observe, and

our will is that it be observed in good faith by our heirs forever. We

have also granted to all freemen of our kingdom, for us and our heirs

forever, all the underwritten liberties, to be had and held by them and

their heirs, of us and our heirs forever.



2. If any of our earls or barons, or others holding of us in chief by

military service shall have died, and at the time of his death his heir

shall be full of age and owe "relief", he shall have his inheritance by

the old relief, to wit, the heir or heirs of an earl, for the whole

baroncy of an earl by L100; the heir or heirs of a baron, L100 for a

whole barony; the heir or heirs of a knight, 100s, at most, and whoever

owes less let him give less, according to the ancient custom of fees.



3. If, however, the heir of any one of the aforesaid has been under age

and in wardship, let him have his inheritance without relief and without

fine when he comes of age.



4. The guardian of the land of an heir who is thus under age, shall take

from the land of the heir nothing but reasonable produce, reasonable

customs, and reasonable services, and that without destruction or waste

of men or goods; and if we have committed the wardship of the lands of

any such minor to the sheriff, or to any other who is responsible to us

for its issues, and he has made destruction or waster of what he holds

in wardship, we will take of him amends, and the land shall be committed

to two lawful and discreet men of that fee, who shall be responsible for

the issues to us or to him to whom we shall assign them; and if we have

given or sold the wardship of any such land to anyone and he has therein

made destruction or waste, he shall lose that wardship, and it shall be

transferred to two lawful and discreet men of that fief, who shall be

responsible to us in like manner as aforesaid.



5. The guardian, moreover, so long as he has the wardship of the land,

shall keep up the houses, parks, fishponds, stanks, mills, and other

things pertaining to the land, out of the issues of the same land; and

he shall restore to the heir, when he has come to full age, all his

land, stocked with ploughs and wainage, according as the season of

husbandry shall require, and the issues of the land can reasonable bear.



6. Heirs shall be married without disparagement, yet so that before the

marriage takes place the nearest in blood to that heir shall have

notice.



7. A widow, after the death of her husband, shall forthwith and without

difficulty have her marriage portion and inheritance; nor shall she give

anything for her dower, or for her marriage portion, or for the

inheritance which her husband and she held on the day of the death of

that husband; and she may remain in the house of her husband for forty

days after his death, within which time her dower shall be assigned to

her.



8. No widow shall be compelled to marry, so long as she prefers to live

without a husband; provided always that she gives security not to marry

without our consent, if she holds of us, or without the consent of the

lord of whom she holds, if she holds of another.



9. Neither we nor our bailiffs will seize any land or rent for any debt,

as long as the chattels of the debtor are sufficient to repay the debt;

nor shall the sureties of the debtor be distrained so long as the

principal debtor is able to satisfy the debt; and if the principal

debtor shall fail to pay the debt, having nothing wherewith to pay it,

then the sureties shall answer for the debt; and let them have the lands

and rents of the debtor, if they desire them, until they are indemnified

for the debt which they have paid for him, unless the principal debtor

can show proof that he is discharged thereof as against the said

sureties.



10. If one who has borrowed from the Jews any sum, great or small, die

before that loan be repaid, the debt shall not bear interest while the

heir is under age, of whomsoever he may hold; and if the debt fall into

our hands, we will not take anything except the principal sum contained

in the bond.



11. And if anyone die indebted to the Jews, his wife shall have her

dower and pay nothing of that debt; and if any children of the deceased

are left under age, necessaries shall be provided for them in keeping

with the holding of the deceased; and out of the residue the debt shall

be paid, reserving, however, service due to feudal lords; in like manner

let it be done touching debts due to others than Jews.



12. No scutage not aid shall be imposed on our kingdom, unless by common

counsel of our kingdom, except for ransoming our person, for making our

eldest son a knight, and for once marrying our eldest daughter; and for

these there shall not be levied more than a reasonable aid. In like

manner it shall be done concerning aids from the city of London.



13. And the city of London shall have all it ancient liberties and free

customs, as well by land as by water; furthermore, we decree and grant

that all other cities, boroughs, towns, and ports shall have all their

liberties and free customs.



14. And for obtaining the common counsel of the kingdom anent the

assessing of an aid (except in the three cases aforesaid) or of a

scutage, we will cause to be summoned the archbishops, bishops, abbots,

earls, and greater barons, severally by our letters; and we will

moveover cause to be summoned generally, through our sheriffs and

bailiffs, and others who hold of us in chief, for a fixed date, namely,

after the expiry of at least forty days, and at a fixed place; and in

all letters of such summons we will specify the reason of the summons.

And when the summons has thus been made, the business shall proceed on

the day appointed, according to the counsel of such as are present,

although not all who were summoned have come.



15. We will not for the future grant to anyone license to take an aid

from his own free tenants, except to ransom his person, to make his

eldest son a knight, and once to marry his eldest daughter; and on each

of these occasions there shall be levied only a reasonable aid.



16. No one shall be distrained for performance of greater service for a

knight's fee, or for any other free tenement, than is due therefrom.



17. Common pleas shall not follow our court, but shall be held in some

fixed place.



18. Inquests of novel disseisin, of mort d'ancestor, and of darrein

presentment shall not be held elsewhere than in their own county courts,

and that in manner following; We, or, if we should be out of the realm,

our chief justiciar, will send two justiciaries through every county

four times a year, who shall alone with four knights of the county

chosen by the county, hold the said assizes in the county court, on the

day and in the place of meeting of that court.



19. And if any of the said assizes cannot be taken on the day of the

county court, let there remain of the knights and freeholders, who were

present at the county court on that day, as many as may be required for

the efficient making of judgments, according as the business be more or

less.



20. A freeman shall not be amerced for a slight offense, except in

accordance with the degree of the offense; and for a grave offense he

shall be amerced in accordance with the gravity of the offense, yet

saving always his "contentment"; and a merchant in the same way, saving

his "merchandise"; and a villein shall be amerced in the same way,

saving his "wainage" if they have fallen into our mercy: and none of the

aforesaid amercements shall be imposed except by the oath of honest men

of the neighborhood.



21. Earls and barons shall not be amerced except through their peers,

and only in accordance with the degree of the offense.



22. A clerk shall not be amerced in respect of his lay holding except

after the manner of the others aforesaid; further, he shall not be

amerced in accordance with the extent of his ecclesiastical benefice.



23. No village or individual shall be compelled to make bridges at river

banks, except those who from of old were legally bound to do so.



24. No sheriff, constable, coroners, or others of our bailiffs, shall

hold pleas of our Crown.



25. All counties, hundred, wapentakes, and trithings (except our demesne

manors) shall remain at the old rents, and without any additional

payment.



26. If anyone holding of us a lay fief shall die, and our sheriff or

bailiff shall exhibit our letters patent of summons for a debt which the

deceased owed us, it shall be lawful for our sheriff or bailiff to

attach and enroll the chattels of the deceased, found upon the lay fief,

to the value of that debt, at the sight of law worthy men, provided

always that nothing whatever be thence removed until the debt which is

evident shall be fully paid to us; and the residue shall be left to the

executors to fulfill the will of the deceased; and if there be nothing

due from him to us, all the chattels shall go to the deceased, saving to

his wife and children their reasonable shares.



27. If any freeman shall die intestate, his chattels shall be

distributed by the hands of his nearest kinsfolk and friends, under

supervision of the Church, saving to every one the debts which the

deceased owed to him.



28. No constable or other bailiff of ours shall take corn or other

provisions from anyone without immediately tendering money therefor,

unless he can have postponement thereof by permission of the seller.



29. No constable shall compel any knight to give money in lieu of

castle-guard, when he is willing to perform it in his own person, or (if

he himself cannot do it from any reasonable cause) then by another

responsible man. Further, if we have led or sent him upon military

service, he shall be relieved from guard in proportion to the time

during which he has been on service because of us.



30. No sheriff or bailiff of ours, or other person, shall take the

horses or carts of any freeman for transport duty, against the will of

the said freeman.



31. Neither we nor our bailiffs shall take, for our castles or for any

other work of ours, wood which is not ours, against the will of the

owner of that wood.



32. We will not retain beyond one year and one day, the lands those who

have been convicted of felony, and the lands shall thereafter be handed

over to the lords of the fiefs.



33. All kydells for the future shall be removed altogether from Thames

and Medway, and throughout all England, except upon the seashore.



34. The writ which is called praecipe shall not for the future be issued

to anyone, regarding any tenement whereby a freeman may lose his court.



35. Let there be one measure of wine throughout our whole realm; and one

measure of ale; and one measure of corn, to wit, "the London quarter";

and one width of cloth (whether dyed, or russet, or "halberget"), to

wit, two ells within the selvedges; of weights also let it be as of

measures.



36. Nothing in future shall be given or taken for a writ of inquisition

of life or limbs, but freely it shall be granted, and never denied.



37. If anyone holds of us by fee-farm, either by socage or by burage, or

of any other land by knight's service, we will not (by reason of that

fee-farm, socage, or burgage), have the wardship of the heir, or of such

land of his as if of the fief of that other; nor shall we have wardship

of that fee-farm, socage, or burgage, unless such fee-farm owes knight's

service. We will not by reason of any small serjeancy which anyone may

hold of us by the service of rendering to us knives, arrows, or the

like, have wardship of his heir or of the land which he holds of another

lord by knight's service.



38. No bailiff for the future shall, upon his own unsupported complaint,

put anyone to his "law", without credible witnesses brought for this

purposes.



39. No freemen shall be taken or imprisoned or disseised or exiled or in

any way destroyed, nor will we go upon him nor send upon him, except by

the lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land.



40. To no one will we sell, to no one will we refuse or delay, right or

justice.



41. All merchants shall have safe and secure exit from England, and

entry to England, with the right to tarry there and to move about as

well by land as by water, for buying and selling by the ancient and

right customs, quit from all evil tolls, except (in time of war) such

merchants as are of the land at war with us. And if such are found in

our land at the beginning of the war, they shall be detained, without

injury to their bodies or goods, until information be received by us, or

by our chief justiciar, how the merchants of our land found in the land

at war with us are treated; and if our men are safe there, the others

shall be safe in our land.



42. It shall be lawful in future for anyone (excepting always those

imprisoned or outlawed in accordance with the law of the kingdom, and

natives of any country at war with us, and merchants, who shall be

treated as if above provided) to leave our kingdom and to return, safe

and secure by land and water, except for a short period in time of war,

on grounds of public policy -- reserving always the allegiance due to

us.



43. If anyone holding of some escheat (such as the honor of Wallingford,

Nottingham, Boulogne, Lancaster, or of other escheats which are in our

hands and are baronies) shall die, his heir shall give no other relief,

and perform no other service to us than he would have done to the baron

if that barony had been in the baron's hand; and we shall hold it in the

same manner in which the baron held it.



44. Men who dwell without the forest need not henceforth come before our

justiciaries of the forest upon a general summons, unless they are in

plea, or sureties of one or more, who are attached for the forest.



45. We will appoint as justices, constables, sheriffs, or bailiffs only

such as know the law of the realm and mean to observe it well.



46. All barons who have founded abbeys, concerning which they hold

charters from the kings of England, or of which they have long continued

possession, shall have the wardship of them, when vacant, as they ought

to have.



47. All forests that have been made such in our time shall forthwith be

disafforsted; and a similar course shall be followed with regard to

river banks that have been placed "in defense" by us in our time.



48. All evil customs connected with forests and warrens, foresters and

warreners, sheriffs and their officers, river banks and their wardens,

shall immediately by inquired into in each county by twelve sworn

knights of the same county chosen by the honest men of the same county,

and shall, within forty days of the said inquest, be utterly abolished,

so as never to be restored, provided always that we previously have

intimation thereof, or our justiciar, if we should not be in England.



49. We will immediately restore all hostages and charters delivered to

us by Englishmen, as sureties of the peace of faithful service.



50. We will entirely remove from their bailiwicks, the relations of

Gerard of Athee (so that in future they shall have no bailiwick in

England); namely, Engelard of Cigogne, Peter, Guy, and Andrew of

Chanceaux, Guy of Cigogne, Geoffrey of Martigny with his brothers,

Philip Mark with his brothers and his nephew Geoffrey, and the whole

brood of the same.



51. As soon as peace is restored, we will banish from the kingdom all

foreign born knights, crossbowmen, serjeants, and mercenary soldiers who

have come with horses and arms to the kingdom's hurt.



52. If anyone has been dispossessed or removed by us, without the legal

judgment of his peers, from his lands, castles, franchises, or from his

right, we will immediately restore them to him; and if a dispute arise

over this, then let it be decided by the five and twenty barons of whom

mention is made below in the clause for securing the peace. Moreover,

for all those possessions, from which anyone has, without the lawful

judgment of his peers, been disseised or removed, by our father, King

Henry, or by our brother, King Richard, and which we retain in our hand

(or which as possessed by others, to whom we are bound to warrant them)

we shall have respite until the usual term of crusaders; excepting those

things about which a plea has been raised, or an inquest made by our

order, before our taking of the cross; but as soon as we return from the

expedition, we will immediately grant full justice therein.



53. We shall have, moreover, the same respite and in the same manner in

rendering justice concerning the disafforestation or retention of those

forests which Henry our father and Richard our brother afforested, and

concerning the wardship of lands which are of the fief of another

(namely, such wardships as we have hitherto had by reason of a fief

which anyone held of us by knight's service), and concerning abbeys

founded on other fiefs than our own, in which the lord of the fee claims

to have right; and when we have returned, or if we desist from our

expedition, we will immediately grant full justice to all who complain

of such things.



54. No one shall be arrested or imprisoned upon the appeal of a woman,

for the death of any other than her husband.



55. All fines made with us unjustly and against the law of the land, and

all amercements, imposed unjustly and against the law of the land, shall

be entirely remitted, or else it shall be done concerning them according

to the decision of the five and twenty barons whom mention is made below

in the clause for securing the pease, or according to the judgment of

the majority of the same, along with the aforesaid Stephen, archbishop

of Canterbury, if he can be present, and such others as he may wish to

bring with him for this purpose, and if he cannot be present the

business shall nevertheless proceed without him, provided always that if

any one or more of the aforesaid five and twenty barons are in a similar

suit, they shall be removed as far as concerns this particular judgment,

others being substituted in their places after having been selected by

the rest of the same five and twenty for this purpose only, and after

having been sworn.



56. If we have disseised or removed Welshmen from lands or liberties, or

other things, without the legal judgment of their peers in England or in

Wales, they shall be immediately restored to them; and if a dispute

arise over this, then let it be decided in the marches by the judgment

of their peers; for the tenements in England according to the law of

England, for tenements in Wales according to the law of Wales, and for

tenements in the marches according to the law of the marches. Welshmen

shall do the same to us and ours.



57. Further, for all those possessions from which any Welshman has,

without the lawful judgment of his peers, been disseised or removed by

King Henry our father, or King Richard our brother, and which we retain

in our hand (or which are possessed by others, and which we ought to

warrant), we will have respite until the usual term of crusaders;

excepting those things about which a plea has been raised or an inquest

made by our order before we took the cross; but as soon as we return (or

if perchance we desist from our expedition), we will immediately grant

full justice in accordance with the laws of the Welsh and in relation to

the foresaid regions.



58. We will immediately give up the son of Llywelyn and all the hostages

of Wales, and the charters delivered to us as security for the peace.



59. We will do towards Alexander, king of Scots, concerning the return

of his sisters and his hostages, and concerning his franchises, and his

right, in the same manner as we shall do towards our owher barons of

England, unless it ought to be otherwise according to the charters which

we hold from William his father, formerly king of Scots; and this shall

be according to the judgment of his peers in our court.



60. Moreover, all these aforesaid customs and liberties, the observances

of which we have granted in our kingdom as far as pertains to us towards

our men, shall be observed b all of our kingdom, as well clergy as

laymen, as far as pertains to them towards their men.



61. Since, moveover, for God and the amendment of our kingdom and for

the better allaying of the quarrel that has arisen between us and our

barons, we have granted all these concessions, desirous that they should

enjoy them in complete and firm endurance forever, we give and grant to

them the underwritten security, namely, that the barons choose five and

twenty barons of the kingdom, whomsoever they will, who shall be bound

with all their might, to observe and hold, and cause to be observed, the

peace and liberties we have granted and confirmed to them by this our

present Charter, so that if we, or our justiciar, or our bailiffs or any

one of our officers, shall in anything be at fault towards anyone, or

shall have broken any one of the articles of this peace or of this

security, and the offense be notified to four barons of the foresaid

five and twenty, the said four barons shall repair to us (or our

justiciar, if we are out of the realm) and, laying the transgression

before us, petition to have that transgression redressed without delay.

And if we shall not have corrected the transgression (or, in the event

of our being out of the realm, if our justiciar shall not have corrected

it) within forty days, reckoning from the time it has been intimated to

us (or to our justiciar, if we should be out of the realm), the four

barons aforesaid shall refer that matter to the rest of the five and

twenty barons, and those five and twenty barons shall, together with the

community of the whole realm, distrain and distress us in all possible

ways, namely, by seizing our castles, lands, possessions, and in any

other way they can, until redress has been obtained as they deem fit,

saving harmless our own person, and the persons of our queen and

children; and when redress has been obtained, they shall resume their

old relations towards us. And let whoever in the country desires it,

swear to obey the orders of the said five and twenty barons for the

execution of all the aforesaid matters, and along with them, to molest

us to the utmost of his power; and we publicly and freely grant leave to

everyone who wishes to swear, and we shall never forbid anyone to swear.

All those, moveover, in the land who of themselves and of their own

accord are unwilling to swear to the twenty five to help them in

constraining and molesting us, we shall by our command compel the same

to swear to the effect foresaid. And if any one of the five and twenty

barons shall have died or departed from the land, or be incapacitated in

any other manner which would prevent the foresaid provisions being

carried out, those of the said twenty five barons who are left shall

choose another in his place according to their own judgment, and he

shall be sworn in the same way as the others. Further, in all matters,

the execution of which is entrusted,to these twenty five barons, if

perchance these twenty five are present and disagree about anything, or

if some of them, after being summoned, are unwilling or unable to be

present, that which the majority of those present ordain or command

shall be held as fixed and established, exactly as if the whole twenty

five had concurred in this; and the said twenty five shall swear that

they will faithfully observe all that is aforesaid, and cause it to be

observed with all their might. And we shall procure nothing from anyone,

directly or indirectly, whereby any part of these concessions and

liberties might be revoked or diminished; and if any such things has

been procured, let it be void and null, and we shall never use it

personally or by another.



62. And all the will, hatreds, and bitterness that have arisen between

us and our men, clergy and lay, from the date of the quarrel, we have

completely remitted and pardoned to everyone. Moreover, all trespasses

occasioned by the said quarrel, from Easter in the sixteenth year of our

reign till the restoration of peace, we have fully remitted to all, both

clergy and laymen, and completely forgiven, as far as pertains to us.

And on this head, we have caused to be made for them letters testimonial

patent of the lord Stephen, archbishop of Canterbury, of the lord Henry,

archbishop of Dublin, of the bishops aforesaid, and of Master Pandulf as

touching this security and the concessions aforesaid.



63. Wherefore we will and firmly order that the English Church be free,

and that the men in our kingdom have and hold all the aforesaid

liberties, rights, and concessions, well and peaceably, freely and

quietly, fully and wholly, for themselves and their heirs, of us and our

heirs, in all respects and in all places forever, as is aforesaid. An

oath, moreover, has been taken, as well on our part as on the art of the

barons, that all these conditions aforesaid shall be kept in good faith

and without evil intent. Given under our hand - the above named and many

others being witnesses - in the meadow which is called Runnymede,

between Windsor and Staines, on the fifteenth day of June, in the

seventeenth year of our reign.





------------------------------------



This is but one of three different translations I found

of the Magna Carta; it was originally done in Latin,

probably by the Archbishop, Stephen Langton.  It was in 

force for only a few months, when it was violated by the

king.  Just over a year later, with no resolution to the

war, the king died, being succeeded by his 9-year old son,

Henry III.  The Charter (Carta) was reissued again, with

some revisions, in 1216, 1217 and 1225.  As near as I can

tell, the version presented here is the one that preceeded

all of the others; nearly all of it's provisions were soon

superceded by other laws, and none of it is effective today.

The two other versions I found each professed to be the 

original, as well.  The basic intent of each is the same.

Candidly, this wouldn't have been my approach  (posh location, closed format, odd group, seemingly self-serving agenda).  
 
I read the article below  as unsympatheticand almost  mocking in its tonetoward Enron.  It's  noteworthy theBeverly Hills meeting was not covered in the Los Angeles  papers.  Instead, this article comes fromthe front page of the Bay Area's San Francisco Chronicle (Democratic bastion and  home to both of California's United States Senators, power broker Willie Brown,  Attorney General Bill Lockyer and the state's public utility commission).  
 
Consistent with myconcern about a "coast-to-coast  firestorm"engulfing Enron, the New York  Times ran two articles today that were  unsupportiveof the  company.

Senator  Dianne Feinstein called for hearings into possible improprieties between members  of the F.E.R.C. and private energy interests.
 
q        Enron's  Dispute With Utility in India Grows More Tangled
By SARITHA RAI
The  dispute between the Enron Corporation and Indian federal and state government  officials keeps getting messier.
 
These follow the Times'  tough piece on Ken Lay yesterday.   Undoubtedly, the Washington Post will have to get into fray  soon.
 
My feeling is that just as  with the "business" side, Enron's public policy strategy needs be well informed,  sophisticated and comprehensive.  I  fear that anything less will fuel the potential of undesirable outcomes for  Enron's reputation, leadership and shareholdervalue.

Enron's secret bid to save deregulation 
PRIVATE  MEETING: Chairman pitches his plan to prominent Californians  Christian Berthelsen, Scott Winokur,  Chronicle Staff Writers 
Saturday, May 26, 2001  ?2001 San Francisco Chronicle   
URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2001/05/26/MN209410.DTL   
Energy executive Kenneth Lay, head of powerful Enron Corp., quietly courted  Arnold Schwarzenegger, Richard Riordan, Michael Milken and other luminaries  this week in Beverly Hills to drum up support for his solution to California's  energy crisis.  
His prescription called for more rate increases, an end to state and  federal investigations and less rather than more regulation.  
Lay, a close friend of President Bush and one of his largest campaign  contributors, hosted a private 90-minute meeting in a conference room at the  Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills on Thursday.  
Among the participants were Milken, the former head of the Drexel Burnham  Lambert investment banking firm who pleaded guilty to fraud charges in 1990  and who now runs a think tank based in Santa Monica; movie star  Schwarzenegger;  
and Riordan, the mayor of Los Angeles. Schwarzenegger and Riordan have been  courted recently as GOP gubernatorial candidates.  
One participant, who agreed to speak on the condition he not be identified,  said the meeting appeared to be geared toward getting participants to support  Lay's vision and then champion it to officials who are trying to solve the  state's energy mess.  
PLAN TO RESCUE DEREGULATION
The source said the timing and tone of the meeting suggested Lay is  concerned that California will abandon its disastrous experiment with power  markets by either re-regulating the system or creating a government authority  to provide electricity. Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation last week to create  and fund a state power authority that would build, buy and run power plants in  California.  
"They're trying to rescue deregulation," the source said of Enron  executives. "They think the whole state power authority is a bad idea."  
At the meeting, Enron representatives circulated a four-page position paper  titled "Comprehensive Solution for California," which was obtained by The  Chronicle. It said ratepayers should bear responsibility for the billions in  debt incurred by the state's public utilities and that investigations of power  price manipulation and political rhetoric are making matters worse.  
The paper made no mention of the possibility that much of the runaway  electricity costs in California is due to market manipulation by power  generators and traders -- a possibility given credibility in studies by  regulators and economists.  
One of the talking points read: "Get deregulation right this time --  California needs a real electricity market, not government takeovers." Another  point suggested giving consumers monetary rebates for conserving electricity.  
INVOLVED IN EARLY DAYS
Lay has been an aggressive champion of deregulated electricity markets and  was an early advocate in persuading California to begin its experiment with a  competitive power market system.  
Lay has created a new kind of company in the process, one that essentially  produces nothing but makes money as a middle-man, buying electricity from  generators and selling it to consumers. During the first quarter of this year,  Enron's revenues increased 281 percent to $50.1 billion.  
Asked about the purpose of the meeting, Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for  Enron, said she would "look into that" and then did not return repeated  telephone calls seeking comment. One participant said Denne was present at the  meeting.  
D.C. CONNECTIONS
Meanwhile, Lay's power in Washington is reported to have reached  unprecedented heights. According to a story in yesterday's New York Times, Lay  supplied the Bush administration with a list of candidates for jobs regulating  the power industry and even interviewed one of them. The story also said Lay  essentially threatened to seek the removal of the chairman of the Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission, Curt Hebert, if he does not support Lay's desire  to further deregulate the nation's electricity system. Lay denied the  allegation.  
Also in attendance at this week's meeting were Bruce Karatz, chief  executive of home builder Kaufman &amp; Broad; Ray Irani, chief executive of  Occidental Petroleum; and Kevin Sharer, chief executive of biotech giant  Amgen.  
Among those who were invited but did not attend were former Los Angeles  Lakers star Earvin "Magic" Johnson; supermarket magnate and Bill Clinton  supporter Ron Burkle; and Dennis Tito, recently returned from the world's  first civilian space trip.  
Milken, through a spokesman, confirmed that he attended the meeting, but  declined to be interviewed. Schwarzenegger could not be reached for comment  through a publicist, and Sharer did not return a call yesterday afternoon.  
A spokesman for Riordan, Peter Hidalgo, said the Los Angeles mayor  attended,  
but was "not intending to formulate any kind of policy position on this  issue.  
His intent is to listen to all sides."  
Attached to the Enron handout was a two-page open letter, addressed to  Davis and the state Legislature, apparently prepared for those who support  Lay's position and would be willing to sign their names to it. The source who  participated in the meeting said those assembled appeared noncommittal and  asked a number of questions of Lay, but did not agree to champion his agenda.

Enron's Power Crisis

"Bizarre" is how everyone describes it. On Aug. 14, Enron CEO Jeff Skilling--a self-described "brilliant" 47-year-old who says he's never suffered any kind of failure--announced he was relinquishing his title and leaving the company after a mere six months in the top job. Skilling insisted that the parting was voluntary, laying the blame on unspecified personal, non-health-related reasons. But by leaving when and how he did, Skilling forfeited a roughly $20 million severance package and gained the responsibility of repaying a $2 million loan that Enron would have forgiven had he stuck around until the end of the year. 
More bizarre than his timing is how quickly Enron's once tight relationship with Wall Street deteriorated during Skilling's reign. The ex-CEO was famously boastful--insisting that Enron's nascent broadband trading business was worth $35 billion--and thin-skinned, declaring on a conference call that a money manager who dared ask for a balance sheet was an "asshole."
The task of restoring Enron's glory falls to Ken Lay, the company's chairman and former CEO, who has replaced Skilling. He's got his work cut out. Enron's "overall quality of earnings has deteriorated, its level of behind-the-scenes financial engineering has increased, and its overall standing with the Street has plunged," wrote UBS Warburg analyst Ron Barone in a recent report--and Barone is one of the bulls. Despite Lay's insistence that there aren't any "accounting issues, trading issues, or reserve issues" at Enron, investors are hesitant to bid the company back up. Indeed, Enron now trades at around $38, down some 60% from its 52-week high. 
One reason Lay's job is so tough is that, as FORTUNE pointed out in March (see "Is Enron Overpriced?" on fortune.com), Enron's financials are on the dim side of opaque. While Wall Street was once willing to take the company's word on financial performance, it no longer is. And because Enron gives analysts so little to work with, building independent models is next to impossible. Enron's major business, the trading and marketing of energy, is relatively new and extremely complicated. Seemingly basic questions--like the effects of lower natural gas prices and less volatility in the energy markets on Enron's profits--are still unanswered. And there's confusion about the relationship between Enron's reported earnings, which reflect changes in the value of its energy-trading portfolio, and the actual cash coming in. In the first half of the year, Enron reported net income of $810 million and cash flow from operations of negative $1.3 billion. 
Then there's the challenge of convincing investors that Enron itself believes it has a rosy future. High-level executives besides Skilling have recently left, and analysts like Jeff Dietert at Simmons say insider selling has been "aggressive" recently. While Enron executives still hold big chunks of stock, according to Thomson Financial/Lancer Analytics, insiders have sold 1.75 million shares in 2001--and they've sold as the stock has fallen, which is generally regarded as a bad sign. Among the biggest sellers: Lay, who has sold 408,000 shares at prices ranging from $81 last winter to $43 in July. Other sellers have included two executives who have since resigned: new business unit head Lou Pai and broadband chief Kenneth Rice. Enron says that sales are related to the pending expiration of options. 
Lay is moving swiftly to address those concerns. He's promised the Street more disclosure about Enron's operations, and to combat criticism about Enron's weak bench he recently announced a new office of the chairman, anointing veterans Greg Whalley and Mark Frevert to help him run the company. No word yet on whether he plans to start buying Enron stock. 
Quote: Wall Street will no longer take the company's word on financial performance.

Enron Offers to Complete Indian Power Plant If Govt Backs Sale

Enron Offers to Complete Indian Power Plant If Govt Backs Sale

     Mumbai, Sept. 6 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. said it will
finish building a $3 billion power plant in India if the
government backs a plan by the biggest energy trader to sell its
majority stake in the unprofitable venture to local banks.

     Work stopped in June on the second construction phase of the
power station in Maharashtra state because the plant's sole
customer, the state electricity board, owes $64 million in unpaid
bills and ceased buying power in May. The expansion, which is 95
percent complete, would add 1,444 megawatts of capacity.

     Enron offered to sell its 65 percent stake in Dabhol Power
Co., the plant's owner, in three tranches to local banks that
helped finance the project, Business Standard reported, citing a
letter to India's Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee from Enron.

     ``We are willing to complete the project at cost should they
(government) proceed with our plan,'' said Jimmy Mogal, a
spokesman for Dabhol Power Co., Enron's local unit.

     Enron would sell 40 percent of its shares in Dabhol once
negotiations with construction operators to finish the work begin.
It would sell a further 50 percent of its stake once construction
restarts in April 2002. The rest would be sold when the project is
completed by January 2003, the paper said.

     Contractors stopped work on the expansion in June because
they hadn't been paid since April.

    Indian banks loaned $1.4 billion to Dabhol without government
guarantees on the loans. The $600 million lent by ABN Amro, Bank
of America Corp. and other overseas banks is covered by government
guarantees.

     Indian lenders would have to disburse about $320 million for
completion of project, which includes construction of a 5 million-
ton liquefied natural gas import and storage facility.



INDIA PRESS: Enron Proposes 3-Stage Sale Of Dabhol Stake

09/06/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) is proposing to sell the foreign equity in India's Dabhol Power Co. to Indian financial institutions through a three-part payment structure extending until Jan. 1, 2003, reports the Business Standard. 
Enron holds a 65.86% stake in DPC, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, or MSEB, holds 14.14%, and Bechtel Corp. (X.BTL) and General Electric Co. (GE) each hold 10%.
Dabhol is a 2,184-megawatt power project in the western Indian state of Mahrashtra. 
Enron wants to sell its equity in DPC following payment disputes with its sole buyer, MSEB, and the federal government's failure to honor its counterguarantee. 
DPC's 1,444-megawatt phase II is about 95% complete. Its construction was abandoned by the contractor because of DPC's inability to pay. 
Under the structure, Enron has asked for initial payment of 40% of the purchase price of the entire foreign equity at the start of renegotiations between potential buyers and construction operators. 
The second installment of 50% has to be paid at the resumption of construction of the second phase of the project, or by April 1, 2002, whichever is earlier. The third and final installment of 10% has to be paid at the time of mechanical completion of the 2,144-MW power plant and regassification facility, or by Jan. 1, 2003, whichever is earlier, the report says. 
In a proposal submitted to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Enron has said in the event the federal government doesn't directly purchase the foreign equity, it should guarantee the payment obligation in full. 
The $2.9 billion Dabhol project has an equity component of $1 billion, with foreign players, including Enron, contributing $858.6 million. India's financial institutions have a total exposure of over 60 billion rupees ($1=INR47.16), the report says. 
The Indian financial institutions, currently preparing a plan for the project's early revival, are considering Enron's proposal, the report said.

More companies looking to hedge their exposure to volatile energy prices
By BRAD FOSS
AP Business Writer

Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - Harrah's Entertainment Inc. is willing to bet on many things. The cost of energy isn't one of them. 
Stung by high electricity and natural gas prices last year, Harrah's is not taking any more chances when it comes to buying the power to keep its casino on the New Jersey shore as bright and noisy as the nearby boardwalk and as cool as an Atlantic breeze.
The company has since locked in long-term supply contracts at fixed prices with Houston-based Enron Corp., joining the growing legion of hotels, manufacturers, retailers and technology firms behaving more like utilities in terms of hedging their exposure to volatile energy prices. 
In January, Harrah's Atlantic City - 86,000 square feet of casino space and more than 1,100 hotel rooms - rang up a natural gas bill that topped $220,000, nearly quadruple what it normally pays during a winter month. 
Under the 7-year deal with Enron, Harrah's agreed to pay roughly $5 per 1,000 cubic feet for a certain amount of natural gas. 
"We wanted to put ourselves in a position where we could even the playing field and not worry about those price spikes," said Stuart Thomas, who oversees energy procurement at Harrah's. 
Last winter, the retail price soared above $10 per 1,000 cubic feet in many parts of the country, and as high as $19 per 1,000 cubic feet in New Jersey. 
At $5 per 1,000 cubic feet, Harrah's natural gas bill last January would have been closer to $60,000. 
While Harrah's will be buffered from the worst-case scenario next January, the company could miss out on some savings if natural gas prices dip below what they've agreed to pay Enron. Harrah's executives said that is a tradeoff they will accept. 
"We didn't do it to save money," said Thomas, emphasizing that Harrah's $40 million-a-year energy bill is a tiny fraction of its overall costs. "We did it to manage risk." 
Harrah's is not alone. Eli Lilly & Co., IBM Corp., Kraft Foods Inc., Saks Inc. and Solvay Polymers Inc. are just some of the companies that have energy management deals with Enron, Duke Energy Corp. and Reliant Resources Inc. 
Enron's energy services unit is head and shoulders above its closest rival in this emerging field, signing $40 billion in contracts since it was created in 1997. After $200 million in losses since 1998, it recorded its first profits of $100 million in profit in the first half of 2001. 
Jeremy Blachman, the division's chief operating officer, attributes the success to the breadth of its portfolio, which includes deals with food and beverage giant Quaker Oats Co. and the Archdiocese of Chicago, which signed a seven-year agreement worth nearly $250 million. 
"Over the last couple of years, and particularly the last 6 to 9 months, we have seen our business go across markets," Blachman said. 
A.G. Edwards & Sons analyst Mike Heim said Enron's energy services unit, which is essentially a seller of electricity and natural gas at retail prices, remains but "a blip" within Enron, which gets 80 percent of its profit from wholesale marketing and trading. 
But if power and natural gas prices remain volatile, "it has the potential to become 10 to 20 percent of their business down the line," Heim said. 
Makers of chemicals, fertilizer, glass and steel - some of the most energy-intensive industries in the United States - were hit the hardest in the past 18 months as natural gas and electricity soared to prices never seen before. 
Companies that were not protected with long-term contracts took it in the neck, said P.J. Juvekar, a senior chemicals analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. 
After Dow Chemical Co., which was protected, completed its purchase of Union Carbide Corp., which wasn't, Dow was hit with a first-quarter loss of $685 million, compared with a profit of $512 million a year earlier. 
"Most of the disappointment came from the Carbide side, where they were fully exposed to $10 (per 1,000 cubic feet) natural gas prices without any hedges," Juvekar said. 
Companies that were protected from last year's energy spikes recognized earlier on that "we didn't feel as comfortable as the market deregulated," said Michael Thaman, chief financial officer of fiberglass giant Owens Corning, which needs massive quantities of natural gas and electricity to melt billions of pounds of glass each year. 
"We certainly don't have any illusions about our ability to beat the market," said Thaman, whose company signed a 10-year contract with Enron worth $1 billion. 
In the case of Harrah's, the most important thing was to rein in energy costs without skimping on amenities at the casino or hotel, said Bill Simpson, facilities manager at the Atlantic City property. 
Shutting down unused slot machines - 3,500 are on at all times - or adjusting the casino floor thermostat - set at a constant 70 degrees - were never considered last winter even as natural gas and electricity prices soared to record levels. Neither was passing along the costs to hotel guests by adding an energy surcharge on their bills, a strategy pursued by many hotel companies.

Enron still plans sale of Portland General
NEW YORK -- Enron Corp. said Wednesday it still plans to sell its Portland General utility in Oregon. 
Enron has been trying to sell the utility for more than a year. A $3.1 billion sale to Sierra Pacific Resources collapsed in April because the California power crisis made it too difficult to win approval, the companies had said. 
Enron is "getting close to another transaction" involving Portland General, Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said at a Lehman Bros. energy conference in New York. 


Power regulators still debating decisions on key energy issues

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - State power regulators were poised Thursday to suspend direct access, the option that allows Californians to choose their electricity provider. 
Though a mere 200,000 Californians switched from their local utility to companies such as Green Mountain Energy or Enron, the Legislature has ordered the Public Utilities Commission to temporarily end consumer choice to keep three struggling utilities from losing more customers.
Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison Co. and San Diego Gas and Electric Co. are each are on the hook for the more than $9.5 billion the state spent buying electricity on their customers' behalf this year. 
The PUC is expected to suspend direct access retroactively to July 1. Energy service providers, such as solar and wind-powered electricity seller Green Mountain Energy, say it's unconstitutional, and have vowed to fight the PUC in court. 
Likely to be missing from Thursday's meeting are several key issues that would affect Californians' electric bills: 
- A proposal to grant the state's power-buying agency the authority to raise electric rates on its own without PUC review to ensure such rates are justified. 
- A proposal to raise rates for San Diego Gas and Electric Co. residential customers by an average of 12 percent. 
- A proposal that bills Pacific Gas and Electric Co. $6.5 billion, Southern California Edison Co. $4 billion and SDG&E $1.5 billion to help the state recoup its power-buying costs. 
PUC President Loretta Lynch said the commission needs more time to review a flood of comments from utilities, consumer advocates and other parties to those decisions. 
The state plans to recover some of the money it has spent buying power by collecting a portion of ratepayer money. 
The more ratepayers each utility has, the lighter the blow to each customer's electric bill. But it would come at the expense of consumer choice, which lawmakers had promoted as the method by which deregulation would foster competition and lead to lower electric rates. 
Rick Counihan, vice president and general manager of Green Mountain Energy, said if the PUC suspends consumer choice until the state stops buying power for the utilities - potentially a decade down the road - consumer choice is dead. 
"(Direct access) was one of the few good things that came out of the restructuring," Counihan said. 
Just as some environmentally conscious customers buy organic produce or recycled paper products, the option to leave their utility and buy power largely generated by the wind or sun was another way they could make a difference, he said. 
Under the PUC plan, customers who signed up with an energy provider before July 1 could keep their contracts until they expire. Deals signed after that date would be nullified, and the customer would be forced to return to a local utility. 
PUC Commissioner Richard Bilas, a vocal proponent of direct access, is hopeful it could resume after the finances of PG&E, Edison and SDG&E improve. 
"When the utilities get back in the business - if they ever get back in the business of going out and buying electricity on behalf of themselves - that could open up direct access again," Bilas said. He predicted that could happen 18 months from now. 
Counihan was less optimistic. 
"I'm very skeptical that we, or other providers, will come back to California," Counihan said. "We'll very likely take our marketing activities and reallocate to other states that are more friendly." 
Counihan also worried a temporary suspension would give the big three utilities no incentive to retain an infrastructure of computers and other technology put into place to process customers who switched to the alternative energy firms.

The attached  "Rough &amp; Tumble" is an electronic clipping service targeted at California  politicos and policy wonks.  It carried the LA Times version of the Lockyer  comments a couple days ago.  Today, it has the NY Times article on Ken  Lay.  It's pretty clear that in the near-term, Enron and it's  leadership are at risk of being engulfed in a political firestorm  which bounces from coast to coast, gaining strength each step of the  way.  
 
However, it  is the long-term challenge that draws my attention.  From my research  to date, I am left with the strong impression that the Enron's capacity  for acquiring, distilling and assessing business information is much  stronger than it's abilities with public policy information.  
 
Ken Lay,  you and your team have shaped a innovative and entrepreneurial  company rooted in agile arbitrage of business knowledge.  Like  Goldman Sachs, it is hard for the "man on the street" to understand  precisely what Enron does.  However, because of your presence in  businesses that play out daily in homes, schools and small  businesses, Enron will be scrutinized in a way the Goldman couldn't imagine  in it's worst nightmares.
 
From my  perspective, the success of Enron's business model demands a sure  footing in both business and public policy.  Going  forward, these two areas of expertise need  become intertwined to assure the success of the highly  sophisticated, ethical, innovative and insightful global corporation  known as Enron.
 
I would like  to help you succeed with this challenge.  I look forward to our  discussions.

Companies pushed up price of power -- After months of investigation,  state regulators say they have evidence suggesting that power companies have  deliberately driven up wholesale electricity prices. Now they must decide  whether those companies have done anything illegal. State Attorney General Bill  Lockyer said Thursday he believes the evidence ``strongly suggests'' power  companies acted illegally to drive up prices. He has said that he would love to  put top energy executives in jail. Brandon  Bailey and Chris O'Brien in the San Jose  Mercury  -- 5/25/01 
Davis blackout warnings -- a significant policy change aimed  at minimizing business and consumer disruptions, Gov. Gray Davis ordered state  officials Thursday to enact a three-tier blackout warning system. Forecasts of  blackouts will be issued 48 hours beforehand, Davis said. General areas will be  identified in warnings issued 24 hours before likely outages. Precise locations  will be announced an hour before the power is cut, he said. Dan Morain and Nancy  Vogel in the Los Angeles  Times  Greg Lucas and Lynda Gledhill in the San  Francisco Chronicle  Noam Levey and  Dion Nissenbaum in the San Jose  Mercury  John Hill in the Sacramento  Bee  Ed Mendel in the San  Diego Union  Robert Garrett in the Riverside  Press  Michael Coit in the Santa Rosa Press   -- 5/25/01 
Davis' popularity plunges in poll -- With California's energy crisis  mounting, Democratic Gov. Gray Davis has suffered a precipitous fall in his job  approval rating and image among state residents, according to a Field Poll  released yesterday. For the first time since his November 1998 election, more  Californians have an unfavorable view of Davis' performance than favorable.  Carla Marinucci in the San  Francisco Chronicle  Hallye Jordan in the  San Jose  Mercury  John Marelius in the San  Diego Union  -- 5/25/01 
Poll puts Riordan, Davis in tight race -- Californians' assessment of Gov.  Gray Davis has plummeted drastically as he has struggled to handle the state  energy crisis, placing outgoing Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan in a virtual  dead heat with him for the 2002 governor's race, according to a Field Poll  released Thursday. Though Riordan has given no clear indication that he intends  to run for governor, 42 percent of registered voters said they would support the  Republican mayor should he challenge Davis, the Democratic incumbent.  Forty-three percent said they would vote for Davis. Emily  Bazar in the Sacramento  Bee  -- 5/25/01 
California to gain from GOP's loss -- A single party switch in the Senate  on Thursday handed California's Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara  Boxer new clout with key leadership roles likely on issues ranging from military  base closings to environmental cleanups. Vermont Sen. James Jeffords'  announcement that he was quitting the Republican Party to be an independent  affiliated with Democrats set up a takeover in which the Democrats, with a de  facto 51-49 majority, will assume all Senate leadership posts and committee  chairs. Bill Hillburg in the Los Angeles  Daily News  -- 5/25/01 
PUC and 'baseline' rates -- Nine days after structuring the  largest electricity rate increase in California history, state regulators on  Thursday launched a reexamination of the unpopular baselines used to determine  how much each residential customer will pay. If the indicators are revised  upward, as most expect, that would grant some customers relief from the rate  hike but could necessitate future ones to generate enough revenue for power  purchases. Tim Reiterman in the Los Angeles  Times  Michael Bazeley in the San Jose  Mercury  Carrie Peyton in the Sacramento  Bee  -- 5/25/01 
Enron Bush  -- Curtis H?bert Jr., Washington's top electricity regulator, said he had barely  settled into his new job this year when he had an unsettling telephone  conversation with Kenneth L. Lay, the head of the nation's largest electricity  trader, the Enron Corporation. Mr. H?bert, chairman of the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission, said that Mr. Lay, a close friend of President Bush's,  offered him a deal: If he changed his views on electricity deregulation, Enron  would continue to support him in his new job. Lowell  Bergman and Jeff Gerth in the New York Times   -- 5/25/01 
Lockyer comes out swinging at oilman Davis has plenty of company in  depths of poll --  The reaction from Gov. Gray Davis' camp to yesterday's poll showing him in the  dumper was quick and blunt. "Tell me something I don't already know," adviser  Paul Maslin said after being hit with the news that the latest Field Poll showed  Davis' job rating down 18 points since January. "None of this is news to us,"  Maslin said. Matier &amp; Ross in the San  Francisco Chronicle  -- 5/25/01 
Water and power -- The California Public Utilities Commission authorized an increase in  American States Water Co.'s rates at the Bear Valley Electric customer service  area of its Southern California Water Co. unit to recover $2.4 million in  deferred electric power costs. The amount will be recovered from customers over  a five-year period. Sam Favate; Dow  Jones Newswires  -- 5/25/01 
Muni power  -- Gov. Davis said he received a pledge Thursday from municipal utility  officials that their agencies will sell excess power to the state at prices much  lower than in the past. Despite simmering resentment at subjecting their  customers to rolling blackouts, the muni officials promised Davis they will keep  cooperating with the state. Municipal utility customers, including those in the  Modesto, Turlock and Merced irrigation districts, will continue to face power  blackouts, officials said afterward. Jim  Miller in the Modesto Bee   -- 5/25/01 
Edison merit raises -- Southern California Edison, which  is struggling to stay out of bankruptcy, will hand out $19 million in merit  raises to its 12,000 employees today, but top executives will forgo the raises  because of the company's financial woes. Edison has doled out hefty merit raises  in the past. But this year, the company will pay the minimum under its variable  compensation program, which rewards employees for meeting certain company goals.  Kate Berry in the Orange County  Register  -- 5/25/01
Cities with own utilities ask FERC to bar blackouts -- More than 15 California cities  that have municipal utilities, including Anaheim, are asking federal regulators  to exempt them from electricity blackouts ordered by the state's Independent  System Operator. The city of Vernon was first to ask the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission to rule that the ISO cannot force it to participate in  California's rolling blackouts to serve demand in other areas. Vernon's utility  argued that it was ridiculous to subject its customers to blackouts when it had  enough power to keep the lights on. Amy Strahan  Butler in the Orange County  Register  -- 5/25/01 
Utility tax windfall -- As electricity rates rise,  consumers will get hit with a double whammy because of an obscure utility bill  tax that many California cities have quietly been collecting for years. A member  of the state Board of Equalization charges that some cities will reap windfalls  from the utility user tax, and he is backing a grass-roots movement to slash or  repeal it. Few local governments are hurrying to forfeit the money, saying that  they need it to pay their own higher energy bills. Wendy  Thermos in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
An air of discontent over diesel backups -- Gov. Gray Davis said yesterday  that he may ask companies to run their emergency generators during Stage 3  electricity alerts as a way to stave off blackouts. And when blackouts do occur,  thousands of tractor-trailer-size generators will whir to life, powering  elevators and lights, hospital equipment, even assembly lines. But that prospect  has created major concerns. Most of those industrial- strength generators run on  diesel oil, a highly polluting fuel. Because they were intended for emergency  use, generators have escaped most environmental regulations. What's more, they  are likely to be called into service on the hottest, smoggiest days of the year.  Carolyn Said in the San  Francisco Chronicle  -- 5/25/01 
Power price controls -- The House Energy and Commerce  Committee delayed consideration of a major energy bill Thursday as Republicans  and Democrats met privately to explore a possible compromise placing price  controls on soaring wholesale electric rates on the West Coast. The negotiations  hinted at a possible watershed change in the Republicans' staunch opposition to  price controls. An earlier effort to include such controls in the bill turned  contentious and was defeated on a mostly partisan vote in subcommittee. Les Blumenthal in the Sacramento  Bee  -- 5/25/01 
For seniors, the heat can kill, doctors warn -- As summer slouches toward  Sacramento amid a drumbeat of calls to conserve electricity, doctors and  advocates for the elderly are sounding a counter-theme. Heat can kill. And most  often, it kills seniors. Year after year, heat waves around the United States  are deadlier than hurricanes or floods, tornadoes or earthquakes, according to  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Carrie Peyton and Nancy Weaver  Teichert in the Sacramento  Bee  -- 5/25/01 
Outages could be fatal for disabled -- Around the clock, an electric  pump supplies supplementary oxygen to 66-year-old Benny Pritchett's diseased  lungs. Pritchett worries that a rolling blackout might kill him. "The  electricity goes out, I'm a dead man," said the San Bernardino apartment dweller  and former chain-smoker. "I've got a (back-up) oxygen tank. It lasts two hours.  When it runs out, I'm dead." Rolling blackouts aren't expected to last much more  than an hour, say Southern California Edison officials, but their Web site  recommends that any customer dependent on electrically operated life-support  equipment buy an emergency generator. Richard  Brooks in the Riverside  Press  -- 5/25/01 
Gasoline prices -- Average gasoline prices statewide are nearly $2 a gallon, and the Los  Angeles region has once again been dubbed the nation's hub of traffic  congestion. So, what's a good Southern Californian to do? Plan a road trip.  Hugo Martin in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
Offshore drilling -- A federal advisory panel Thursday urged the Bush administration to  identify the five most promising areas to drill for natural gas in coastal  waters off California and other states, which have been off limits to drilling  for nearly 20 years. Citing the nation's unmet energy needs, the advisory group  to Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton suggested that locating the top reservoirs  of natural gas would help determine if there "are grounds and support for a  limited lifting of" moratoriums on offshore drilling. The ban now covers 610  million acres of ocean off the Pacific, Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Kenneth Weiss in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
Judge demands straight answers from El Paso Corp. -- An irate judge threatened  yesterday to subpoena the president of a Texas energy firm accused of  manipulating California natural gas prices, saying he couldn't get straight  answers out of another high-ranking company executive. The eruption by Curtis  Wagner Jr., the administrative law judge presiding over a federal probe of  alleged market manipulation by El Paso Corp., prompted the company to schedule  voluntary testimony by President William Wise today in Washington, D.C. Bernadette Tansey in the San  Francisco Chronicle  -- 5/25/01 
El Paso executive and collusion -- The head of a Texas energy  conglomerate personally endorsed a deal between two subsidiaries accused of  manipulating the natural gas market in Southern California to drive up prices, a  senior official of the firm testified Thursday. The testimony in a trial-like  hearing before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission raised questions about  whether top officials of Houston-based El Paso Corp. violated FERC rules  requiring arm's-length dealings within a corporate family. The admission by El  Paso executive Ralph Eads marked a shift from his previous testimony and was  elicited through sharp questioning by an angry judge who threatened to subpoena  Eads' boss. Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
Riverside no blackouts -- Southern California Edison won't  immediately challenge Riverside's decision against using rolling blackouts to  save energy this summer, a spokesman said Thursday. Edison doesn't care how the  city of Riverside curtails its energy use as long as the city makes the required  cuts during a statewide power shortage, Edison spokesman Steve Hansen said.  Dan Lee in the Riverside  Press  -- 5/25/01 
Energy crisis hits muni bonds -- Investors fled the California  municipal bond market last month, taking with them a net $3.5 billion, their  departure prompted in part by the state's energy crisis and taxes, a fund  analysis firm said Thursday. The withdrawals in April marked the worst such  outflow in years, and it comes as the state is preparing this August to issue a  record $13.4 billion in bonds to bail out utilities. Loretta Kalb in the Sacramento Bee   -- 5/25/01 
With a perfectly negative crisis record, Davis desperate for a  win -- So far, Gov. Gray Davis has amassed an unblemished record in  his handling of the energy crisis. Not one major aspect of the situation has  moved in the positive direction Davis said -- and clearly hoped -- it would, to  wit: Dan Walters in the Sacramento  Bee  -- 5/25/01 
Hot days don't cut the power -- A combination of factors kept the  state's beleaguered system out of the red this time. The heat wave didn't hit  all areas of the state at the same time, and cooler weather in the Pacific  Northwest got power flowing from that region to California again. Also, there  have been no new power-plant malfunctions, and many of the smaller generating  facilities that were AWOL a few weeks ago, when the last blackouts hit, are  operating again. A huge potential contributor to blackout avoidance -- but one  that's difficult to quantify -- is conservation. Jack  Katzanek in the Riverside  Press  -- 5/25/01 
Long Beach Boeing layoffs -- Reflecting a sagging market for  100-seat jetliners, the Boeing Co. will lay off about 600 employees this year at  its commercial factory in Long Beach, the company confirmed Thursday. That  decision followed an internal study by Boeing that was completed earlier this  year, said spokesman Warren Lamb, who did not elaborate. Ian Hanigan in the Long Beach Press  --  5/25/01 
Hahn --  His job is to both prosecute and defend. And with that tricky mandate, Los  Angeles City Atty. James Kenneth Hahn for 16 years has led a law office that, in  sheer numbers, would rank among the biggest in the country. With some 450  attorneys, responsibility for both criminal and civil cases, and an annual  budget of $70 million, the office, like the city it serves, is big, diverse,  complex. But a review of Hahn's record suggests that his performance has been  mixed--deliberate and plodding, pragmatic and obstinate. Greg Krikorian and Patrick  McGreevey in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
Villaraigosa and Hahn and housing -- It doesn't fire up voters like a  stump speech on crime, schools or traffic congestion. But the sheer magnitude of  the city's housing shortage has placed it squarely--albeit quietly--on the  agendas of both candidates running for mayor of Los Angeles. Eight years of a  widely criticized lack of mayoral attention to the housing problem combined with  a high concentration of low-wage workers has earned Los Angeles a reputation as  one of the most unaffordable, overcrowded metropolitan centers in the country,  plagued by low home ownership rates and slum conditions. Lee Romney in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
Villaraigosa and Hahn annd crime and gangs -- Mayoral candidates Antonio  Villaraigosa and City Attorney James Hahn continued Thursday to compare their  plans to deal with crime as they near the June 5 runoff election. Hahn, filing  papers in court to seek injunctions against two Wilmington gangs, touted his  efforts over the past several years to control gang activity throughout the  city. "The root of the violence is drugs and ... for turf and control," Hahn  said of the two gangs -- but which, he added, applies to most gangs in the city.  Rick Orlov in the Los Angeles  Daily News  -- 5/25/01 
Dean Andal  -- State Board of Equalization member Dean Andal is expected to announce today  that he plans to run for state controller next year. The 41-year-old Republican  from Stockton said he will run on a platform that includes lowering utility  taxes paid by residents and businesses in Los Angeles, which are 10% and 12.5%,  respectively. The story is in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
Jim Rogan  -- President Bush on Thursday nominated former Congressman James Rogan to be  undersecretary of commerce for intellectual property and director of the U.S.  Trademark Office. The job pays $130,200 a year. Bush's selection of Rogan, which  will require confirmation by the Senate, could be a positive sign for Hollywood,  which has been lobbying for increased enforcement of copyright laws, including a  crackdown on Internet piracy. Bill Hillburg in  the Los  Angeles Daily News  -- 5/25/01 
Living wage -- While attorneys speculated on the constitutionality of Santa Monica's  newly approved living wage law, hotel housekeeper Blanca Mendez was just hoping  Thursday that she can benefit if a raise to $10.50 an hour goes into effect next  summer at large downtown and beach-side businesses. "It would be fantastic,"  said Mendez, who now earns $8.50 an hour after seven years at the Streamline  Moderne-style Shangri-La Hotel near the ocean. "The economy is very difficult;  everything is getting expensive, like gas, like energy." Oscar Johnson and Ofelia  Casillas in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
9 tribes' casino plans put on hold -- Gov. Gray Davis won't approve any  more agreements with Indian tribes to allow casinos until the federal courts  resolve a legal challenge to California's Indian gaming law. So far, the  governor's moratorium on new Indian gaming compacts, announced in a letter to  nine California tribes, doesn't appear to affect three Sonoma County tribes that  have announced plans for casinos. But it could delay the progress of the nine  other tribes that have asked the governor to negotiate gaming agreements,  including the Round Valley tribe in Mendocino County. Steve Hart in the Santa Rosa Press   -- 5/25/01 
Charity foundations growth -- California's charitable  foundation assets--which were relatively modest as recently as two decades  ago--are now growing at a rate faster than those in the rest of the country,  according to a study by the new USC Center on Philanthropy and Public Policy. In  1978, California held 8% of national foundation assets; in 1998 it accounted for  14%, the study said. During the same period, the state's share of foundation  grants grew from 7% to 11% of total giving nationwide, it said. "California is  catching up and jumping forward," said Marcia K. Sharp, a research fellow at the  USC Center on Philanthropy and Public Policy, and a co-author of the study.  Anne-Marie O'Connor in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
Documents seized in S.F. minority contract probe are  inadmissible -- In a  potential blow to prosecutors, a U.S. judge said that federal investigators  violated a San Francisco city official's privacy rights when they searched her  office looking for evidence of fraud in a city minority contracting program. The  FBI seized hundreds of pages of records from the San Francisco Human Rights  Commission office of chief contract compliance officer Zula Jones in August  1999. Chuck Finnie and Lance Williams in the San  Francisco Chronicle  -- 5/25/01 
Feinstein fast-tracks water storage plans -- California can't forestall a  water crisis without building more storage facilities, Sen. Dianne Feinstein  said yesterday in responding to environmental critics of her bill to reauthorize  the CalFed ecosystem restoration program. Eric Brazil in the San  Francisco Chronicle  Michael Gardner in the  San  Diego Union  -- 5/25/01 
Californians' recycling efforts hit skids -- Californians are recycling a  lower percentage of redeemable plastic, glass and aluminum beverage containers  than they have in more than a decade, the state Department of Conservation  reported Thursday. While officials note the recycling drop is partially due to  an increasing number of products available for redemption, they also point to  research suggesting consumers' habits may be slipping. Ed  Fletcher in the Sacramento  Bee  -- 5/25/01 
UC admissions policy -- A UC Berkeley request to be  exempted from a University of California admissions policy is creating concern  among administrators and faculty who object to looking at one campus in  isolation. Instead, they said, the Berkeley request probably should be folded  into a systemwide review of admissions already under way. Tanya Schevitz in the San  Francisco Chronicle  -- 5/25/01 
Irvine cash crop: business -- Irvine One of the largest  commercial developments in the county could be built in the next five to seven  years, replacing checkered fields of strawberries and other crops. The 670 acres  of fields and a scattering of industrial buildings just outside Irvine's  northeastern border is large enough to host 12 Disneylands, but The Irvine Co.  has other plans. Laura Corbin, Jennifer Hieger  and Elizabeth Aguilera in the Orange County  Register  -- 5/25/01 
Like a Rolling Tone -- It looked like a scene from the  hotel karaoke lounge, where the microphone-hogging guy won't stop belting Tom  Jones tunes and a few cocktail-sipping patrons keep their eyes glued to their  drinks in embarrassment. But it was official state business at the state Capitol  on Thursday when members of the Assembly attempted to pay tribute to Bob Dylan  on his 60th birthday by feebly singing along with his 1973 recording of "Forever  Young." Lesli A. Maxwell in the Fresno  Bee  -- 5/25/01 
Joe Lockhart -- Barely six months after joining Oracle Corp. as a communications  consultant to chief executive Larry Ellison, former White House press secretary  Joe Lockhart has left the database software firm. Both sides yesterday denied a  rift between the two men and blamed Lockhart's frequent trips from his home in  Washington, D.C., to Oracle's Redwood Shores headquarters for the departure.  Kelly Zito in the San  Francisco Chronicle  -- 5/25/01 More..

  <content type="text" name="message">POWER POINTS: Skilling Moves On To Charities, Family
   By Mark Golden
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Jeff Skilling will be spending the next few years
working with charities in Houston and spending time with family, the former
chief executive of Enron Corp. (ENE) said in an interview.
  The 47-year-old Skilling, who resigned abruptly from Enron after the
company's
board meeting Aug. 14, repeatedly said he had left - as stated - for
personal
reasons. Wall Street has been skeptical of the explanation, and several
analysts
have said they're waiting for "the other shoe to drop." The company's stock
price fell 14% in response to the announcement last week - a loss of about
$4.5
billion in shareholder value - and hasn't recovered this week.
  But the former chief executive said the stock price will recover once
investors see that his departure isn't a precursor to more bad news for the
company.
  "I've spent the last 34 years working really hard," said Skilling, who
requested the interview with Dow Jones Newswires. "There are a lot of things
that I haven't been doing - personal interests, spending time with family.
There
are a number of charitable things that I haven't spent the time on that I
believe I should. I don't mean fundraising, but hands on, getting out and
doing
things, building houses, helping individuals."
  Skilling, who has been involved with a multiple sclerosis charity for
years,
said he plans to get involved in promoting the City of Houston.
  "It's massively underrated as a place to work and live," he said. "It's a
great city, and I think I can do a lot to get that across."
  Though insistent that there is nothing more to his departure than personal
reasons, Skilling said little to reveal why a talented executive would
surrender
the top spot of the country's largest energy trading company just six months
after taking the job. Skilling had been Enron's No. 2 executive from 1997
until
this year, and he's generally credited with the success of Enron's wholesale
trading operations, which comprise about 80% of the parent's earnings.
  He confirmed there's no crisis in his family, and his health is fine.
Skilling, who assumed the chief executive title on Feb. 12, also denied that
he
was suffering under the strain of the job.
  Late last week, Chairman Kenneth Lay and other Enron executives in New
York
told Wall Street analysts that Skilling had been going "kind of nuts" under
the
pressure of being chief executive, one analyst said.
  "It's not true that I was cracking up," he said. "Do I sound like someone
who
is cracking up? The representation of me as thick-skinned is a reasonable
representation."
  When asked if his departure could have been handled more smoothly so as
not to
alarm investors, Skilling said that perhaps the mechanics could have been
better, but said that is hindsight.
  "We thought it through and thought we were going about it in the right
way,"
he said. "I don't know what we could have done differently. It will turn
out, in
retrospect, fine, as soon as people see that there's nothing else."

   About One Week's Notice

  The former chief executive totally disagreed with speculation in this
column
last week that Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay, who immediately resumed the role
of
chief executive, may have wanted to regain day-to-day control of the company
and
pushed Skilling out.
  "I think the world of Ken. You can't find a bigger fan of his than me," he
said. "I was not forced out. Personal and family reasons are 100% of the
story.
I guess it's kind of mundane, and I'm sorry it doesn't have as much drama
and
suspense as a lot of people would like it to have, but that's what the deal
is."
  Skilling said he spoke with Lay about wanting to do other things many
times
over the years. The first serious discussion of his imminent departure came
about a week before the announcement, said Skilling, whose recollection of
his
giving notice to Lay was somewhat cloudy.
  "The board knew what was going on, and that was the point (the Aug. 14
board
meeting) where the decisions were going to be made," he said.
  The decisions?
  "I guess to accept my resignation," Skilling said.
  Enron refused to release a copy of the minutes of the Aug. 14 board
meeting,
which was regularly scheduled. The company doesn't generally release
board-meeting minutes, spokeswoman Karen Denne said.
  The former chief executive continues to work as a paid adviser to Enron. A
clause in his contract prevents him from competing with the company through
the
end of 2003, and he has no plans to work outside the energy industry.
  That might sound like a big comedown from running the country's most
aggressive energy company, but Skilling said the move fits.
  "Some people say 'Well, you were working and aspiring so long to become
CEO of
Enron.' That's not true. I was working to build a business, and we did,"
said
Skilling, who is credited with transforming the company into a trading
powerhouse.
  "The company I built is doing great. My life is moving on."
  He also said the company will do fine without him. Some analysts have
expressed concern about Enron's ability to retain its top talent. Skilling's
predecessor as Enron's No. 2 executive, Richard Kinder, for example, left
the
company in 1996 after Lay announced that he would be retaining the chief
executive spot for another five years. Kinder went on to buy Enron's small
liquids pipeline business and turned that company into Kinder-Morgan Inc.
(KMI).
  Enron's current management, Skilling said, has a "very deep bench." For
example, he described Enron Energy Services Chief Executive Dave Delaney as
"awesome."
  "Dave created the Canadian business in Enron," Skilling said.

The Court has considered the record evidence submitted by the parties, made determinations as to its relevancy and materiality, assessed the credibility of the testimony of the witnesses, both written and oral, and ascertained for its purposes the probative significance of the documentary and visual evidence presented.  Upon the record before the Court as of July 28, 1999, at the close of the admission of evidence, pursuant to </span><span>Fed. R. Civ. P.</span><span> 52(a), the Court finds the following facts to have been proved by a preponderance of the evidence.  The Court shall state the conclusions of law to be drawn therefrom in a separate Memorandum and Order to be filed in due course.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>I.BACKGROUND</span></p><p><span>1.A “personal computer” (“PC”) is a digital information processing device designed for use by one person at a time.  A typical PC consists of central processing components (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, a microprocessor and main memory) and mass data storage (such as a hard disk).  A typical PC system consists of a PC, certain peripheral input/output devices (including a monitor, a keyboard, a mouse, and a printer), and an operating system.  PC systems, which include desktop and laptop models, can be distinguished from more powerful, more expensive computer systems known as “servers,” which are designed to provide data, services, and functionality through a digital network to multiple users.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>2.An “operating system” is a software program that controls the allocation and use of computer resources (such as central processing unit time, main memory space, disk space, and input/output channels).  The operating system also supports the functions of software programs, called “applications,” that perform specific user-oriented tasks.  The operating system supports the functions of applications by exposing interfaces, called “application programming interfaces,” or “APIs.”  These are synapses at which the developer of an application can connect to invoke pre-fabricated blocks of code in the operating system.  These blocks of code in turn </span></p><p><span>perform crucial tasks, such as displaying text on the computer screen.  Because it supports applications while interacting more closely with the PC system’s hardware, the operating system is said to serve as a “platform.”</span></p><p><span>3.An Intel-compatible PC is one designed to function with Intel’s 80x86/Pentium families of microprocessors or with compatible microprocessors manufactured by Intel or by other firms.</span></p><p><span>4.An operating system designed to run on an Intel-compatible PC will not function on a non-Intel-compatible PC, nor will an operating system designed for a non-Intel-compatible PC function on an Intel-compatible one.  Similarly, an application that relies on APIs specific to one operating system will not, generally speaking, function on another operating system unless it is first adapted, or “ported,” to the APIs of the other operating system.</span></p><p><span>5.Defendant Microsoft Corporation is organized under the laws of the State of Washington, and its headquarters are situated in Redmond, Washington.  Since its inception, Microsoft has focused primarily on developing software and licensing it to various purchasers.</span></p><p><span>6.In 1981, Microsoft released the first version of its Microsoft Disk Operating System, commonly known as “MS-DOS.”  The system had a character-based user interface that required the user to type specific instructions at a command prompt in order to perform tasks such as launching applications and copying files.  When the International Business Machines Corporation (“IBM”) selected MS-DOS for pre-installation on its first generation of PCs, Microsoft’s product became the predominant operating system sold for Intel-compatible PCs.</span></p><p><span>7.In 1985, Microsoft began shipping a software package called Windows.  The product included a graphical user interface, which enabled users to perform tasks by selecting icons and words on the screen using a mouse.  Although originally just a user-interface, or “shell,” sitting on top of MS-DOS, Windows took on more operating-system functionality over time.</span></p><p><span>8.In 1995, Microsoft introduced a software package called Windows 95, which announced itself as the first operating system for Intel-compatible PCs that exhibited the same sort of integrated features as the Mac OS running PCs manufactured by Apple Computer, Inc. (“Apple”).  Windows 95 enjoyed unprecedented popularity with consumers, and in June 1998, Microsoft released its successor, Windows 98.</span></p><p><span>9.Microsoft is the leading supplier of operating systems for PCs.  The company transacts business in all fifty of the United States and in most countries around the world. </span></p><p><span>10.Microsoft licenses copies of its software programs directly to consumers.  The largest part of its MS-DOS and Windows sales, however, consists of licensing the products to manufacturers of PCs (known as “original equipment manufacturers” or “OEMs”), such as the IBM PC Company and the Compaq Computer Corporation (“Compaq”).  An OEM typically installs a copy of Windows onto one of its PCs before selling the package to a consumer under a single price.</span></p><p><span>11.The Internet is a global electronic network, consisting of smaller, interconnected networks, which allows millions of computers to exchange information over telephone wires, dedicated data cables, and wireless links.  The Internet links PCs by means of servers, which run specialized operating systems and applications designed for servicing a network environment.</span></p><p><span>12.The World Wide Web (“the Web”) is a massive collection of digital information resources stored on servers throughout the Internet.  These resources are typically provided in the form of hypertext documents, commonly referred to as “Web pages,” that may incorporate any combination of text, graphics, audio and video content, software programs, and other data.  A user of a computer connected to the Internet can publish a page on the Web simply by copying it into a specially designated, publicly accessible directory on a Web server.  Some Web resources are in the form of applications that provide functionality through a user’s PC system but actually execute on a server.</span></p><p><span>13.Internet content providers (“ICPs”) are the individuals and organizations that have established a presence, or “site,” on the Web by publishing a collection of Web pages.  Most Web pages are in the form of “hypertext”; that is, they contain annotated references, or “hyperlinks,” to other Web pages.  Hyperlinks can be used as cross-references within a single document, between documents on the same site, or between documents on different sites.</span></p><p><span>14.Typically, one page on each Web site is the “home page,” or the first access point to the site.  The home page is usually a hypertext document that presents an overview of the site and hyperlinks to the other pages comprising the site.</span></p><p><span>15.PCs typically connect to the Internet through the services of Internet access providers (“IAPs”), which generally charge subscription fees to their customers in the United States.  There are two types of IAPs.  Online services (“OLSs”) such as America Online (“AOL”), Prodigy, and the Microsoft Network (“MSN”) offer, in addition to Internet access, various services and an array of proprietary content.  Internet service providers (“ISPs”) such as MindSpring and Netcom, on the other hand, offer few services apart from Internet access and relatively little of their own content.</span></p><p><span>16.A “Web client” is software that, when running on a computer connected to the Internet, sends information to and receives information from Web servers throughout the Internet.  Web clients and servers transfer data using a standard known as the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (“HTTP”).  A “Web browser” is a type of Web client that enables a user to select, retrieve, and perceive resources on the Web.  In particular, Web browsers provide a way for a user to view hypertext documents and follow the hyperlinks that connect them, typically by moving the cursor over a link and depressing the mouse button.</span></p><p><span>17.Although certain Web browsers provided graphical user interfaces as far back as 1993, the first widely-popular graphical browser distributed for profit, called Navigator, was brought to market by the Netscape Communications Corporation in December 1994.  Microsoft introduced its browser, called Internet Explorer, in July 1995.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>II.THE RELEVANT MARKET</span></p><p><span>18.Currently there are no products, nor are there likely to be any in the near future, that a significant percentage of consumers world-wide could substitute for Intel-compatible PC operating systems without incurring substantial costs.  Furthermore, no firm that does not currently market Intel-compatible PC operating systems could start doing so in a way that would, within a reasonably short period of time, present a significant percentage of consumers with a viable alternative to existing Intel-compatible PC operating systems.  It follows that, if one firm controlled the licensing of all Intel-compatible PC operating systems world-wide, it could set the price of a license substantially above that which would be charged in a competitive market and leave the price there for a significant period of time without losing so many customers as to make the action unprofitable.  Therefore, in determining the level of Microsoft’s market power, the relevant market is the licensing of all Intel-compatible PC operating systems world-wide.</span></p><p><span>A.Demand Substitutability</span></p><p><span>1.Server Operating Systems</span></p><p><span>19.Consumers could not turn from Intel-compatible PC operating systems to Intel-</span></p><p><span>compatible server operating systems without incurring substantial costs, since the latter type of system is sold at a significantly higher price than the former.  A consumer intent on acquiring a server operating system would also have to buy a computer of substantially greater power and price than an Intel-compatible PC, because server operating systems generally cannot function properly on PC hardware.  The price of an Intel-compatible PC operating system accounts for only a very small percentage of the price of an Intel-compatible PC system.  Thus, even a substantial increase in the price of an Intel-compatible PC operating system above the competitive level would result in only a trivial increase in the price of an Intel-compatible PC system.  Very few consumers would purchase expensive servers in response to a trivial increase in the price of an Intel-compatible PC system.  Furthermore, a consumer would not obtain a satisfactory substitute for an Intel-compatible PC operating system even if he purchased a server, since server operating systems lack the features — and support for the breadth of applications — that induce users to purchase Intel-compatible PC operating systems.</span></p><p><span>2.Non-Intel-Compatible PC Operating Systems</span></p><p><span>20.Since only Intel-compatible PC operating systems will work with Intel-compatible PCs, a consumer cannot opt for a non-Intel-compatible PC operating system without obtaining a non-Intel-compatible PC.  Thus, for consumers who already own an Intel-compatible PC system, the cost of switching to a non-Intel compatible PC operating system includes the price of not only a new operating system, but also a new PC and new peripheral devices.  It also includes the effort of learning to use the new system, the cost of acquiring a new set of compatible applications, and the work of replacing files and documents that were associated with the old applications.  Very few consumers would incur these costs in response to the trivial increase in the price of an Intel-</span></p><p><span>compatible PC system that would result from even a substantial increase in the price of an Intel-</span></p><p><span>compatible PC operating system.  For example, users of Intel-compatible PC operating systems would not switch in large numbers to the Mac OS in response to even a substantial, sustained increase in the price of an Intel-compatible PC operating system.</span></p><p><span>21.The response to a price increase would be somewhat greater among consumers buying their first PC system, because they would not have already invested time and money in an Intel-compatible PC system and a set of compatible applications.  Apple does not license the Mac OS separately from its PC hardware, however, and the package of hardware and software comprising an Apple PC system is priced substantially higher than the average price of an Intel-</span></p><p><span>compatible PC system.  Furthermore, consumer demand for Apple PC systems suffers on account of the relative dearth of applications written to run on the Mac OS.  It is unlikely, then, that a firm controlling the licensing of all Intel-compatible PC operating systems would lose so many new PC users to Apple as the result of a substantial, enduring price increase as to make the action unprofitable.  It is therefore proper to define a relevant market that excludes the Mac OS.  In any event, as Section III of these findings demonstrates, including the Mac OS in the relevant market would not alter the Court’s conclusion as to the level of Microsoft’s market power.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>3.Information Appliances</span></p><p><span>22.No operating system designed for a hand-held computer, a “smart” wireless telephone, a television set-top box, or a game console is capable of performing as an adequate operating system for an Intel-compatible PC.  Therefore, in order to adopt a substitute for the Intel-compatible PC operating system from the realm of “information appliances,” a consumer must acquire one or more of these devices in lieu of an Intel-compatible PC system.</span></p><p><span>23.It is possible that, within the next few years, those consumers who otherwise would use an Intel-compatible PC system solely for storing addresses and schedules, for sending and receiving E-mail, for browsing the Web, and for playing video games might be able to choose a complementary set of information appliances over an Intel-compatible PC system without incurring substantial costs.  To the extent this substitution occurs, though, it will be the result of innovation by the producers of information appliances, and it will occur even if Intel-compatible PC operating systems are priced at the same level that they would be in a competitive market.  More importantly, while some consumers may decide to make do with one or more information appliances in place of an Intel-compatible PC system, the number of these consumers will, for the foreseeable future, remain small in comparison to the number of consumers deciding that they still need an Intel-compatible PC system.  One reason for this is the fact that no single type of information appliance, nor even all types in the aggregate, provides all of the features that most consumers have come to rely on in their PC systems and in the applications that run on them.  Thus, most of those who buy information appliances will do so in addition to, rather than instead of, buying an Intel-compatible PC system.  Not surprisingly, then, sales of PC systems are not expected to suffer on account of the growing consumer interest in information appliances.  It follows that, for the foreseeable future, a firm controlling the licensing of all Intel-compatible PC operating systems could set prices substantially above competitive levels without losing an unacceptable amount of business to information appliances.</span></p><p><span>4.Network Computers</span></p><p><span>24.A network computer system (sometimes called a “thin client”) typically contains central processing components with basic capabilities, certain key peripheral devices (such as a monitor, a keyboard, and a mouse), an operating system, and a browser.  The system contains no mass storage, however, and it processes little if any data locally.  Instead, the system receives processed data and software as needed from a server across a network.  A network computer system lacks the hardware resources to support an Intel-compatible PC operating system.  It follows that software applications written to run on a specific Intel-compatible PC operating system will not run on a network computer.  Network computers can run applications residing on a designated server, however.  Moreover, a network computer system typically can run applications residing on other servers, so long as those applications are accessible through Web sites.  The ability to run server-based applications is not exclusive to network computer systems, however.  Generally speaking, any PC system equipped with a browser and an Internet connection is capable of accessing applications hosted through Web sites. </span></p><p><span>25.Since the network computing model relies heavily on the processing power and memory of servers, the requirements for the user’s hardware (and thus the price of that hardware) are low relative to those of an Intel-compatible PC system.  Still, a user who already owns a relatively expensive Intel-compatible PC system is not likely to abandon the investment and acquire less powerful hardware just because one of the least expensive components of his PC system — the operating system — is substantially more expensive than it would be under competitive conditions.  Just as does the Mac OS, the network computing model presents a somewhat more attractive alternative to the first-time computer buyer.  But as in the case where a prospective purchaser is considering acquiring the Apple alternative, a new buyer considering the network computing model must choose between types of computer systems.  If the consumer opts for the less expensive hardware of the network computer, that hardware will not support an Intel-compatible PC operating system; and if the new buyer opts for the more expensive hardware of an Intel-compatible PC, an Intel-compatible PC operating system will almost certainly come pre-installed (and in any event represent very little additional cost relative to the price of the hardware).</span></p><p><span>26.Only a few firms currently market network computer systems, and the systems have yet to attract substantial consumer demand.  In part, this is because PC systems, which can store and process data locally as well as communicate with a server, have decreased so much in price as to call into question the value proposition of buying a network computer system.  This fact would not change if the price of an Intel-compatible PC operating system rose significantly, because the resulting change in the price of an Intel-compatible PC system would be very minor.  Another reason for the limited demand for network computer systems is the fact that few consumers are in a position to turn from PC systems to network computer systems without making substantial sacrifices; for the network computing option exhibits significant shortcomings for current PC owners and first-time buyers alike.  The problems of latency, congestion, asynchrony, and insecurity across a communications network, and contention for limited processing and memory resources at the remote server, can all result in a substantial derogation of computing performance.  Moreover, the owner of a network computer is required to enter into long-term dependency upon the owner of a remote server in order to obtain functionality that would reside within his control if he owned a PC system.  If network computing becomes a viable alternative to PC-based computing, it will be because innovation by the proponents of the network computing model overcomes these problems, and it will happen even if Intel-compatible PC operating systems are priced at competitive levels.  In any case, that day has not arrived, nor does it appear imminent.</span></p><p><span>5.Server-Based Computing Generally</span></p><p><span>27.As the bandwidth available to the average user increases, “portal” Web sites, which aggregate Web content and provide services such as search engines, E-mail, and travel reservation systems, could begin to host full lines of the server-based, personal-productivity applications that have begun to appear in small numbers on the Web.  If so, increasing numbers of computer users equipped with Web browsers and IAP connections could begin to conduct a significant portion of their computing through these portals.  To the extent they might do so, users probably would not regard the Mac OS’s limited stock of compatible applications as the major drawback to using an Apple PC system that it is today, and they might be increasingly drawn to network computer systems and information appliances.  The variety and ease of use of server-based applications accessible through browsers would have to increase a great deal from today’s levels, however, before the total costs of dispensing with an Intel-compatible PC operating system would decline sufficiently to impose a significant constraint on the pricing of those systems.  Again, that day is not imminent; for at least the next few years, the overwhelming majority of consumers accessing server-based applications will do so using an Intel-compatible PC system and a browser.</span></p><p><span>6.Middleware</span></p><p><span>28.Operating systems are not the only software programs that expose APIs to application developers.  The Netscape Web browser and Sun Microsystems, Inc.’s Java class libraries are examples of non-operating system software that do likewise.  Such software is often called “middleware” because it relies on the interfaces provided by the underlying operating system while simultaneously exposing its own APIs to developers.  Currently no middleware product exposes enough APIs to allow independent software vendors (“ISVs”) profitably to write full-featured personal productivity applications that rely solely on those APIs.  </span></p><p><span>29.Even if middleware deployed enough APIs to support full-featured applications, it would not function on a computer without an operating system to perform tasks such as managing hardware resources and controlling peripheral devices.  But to the extent the array of applications relying solely on middleware comes to satisfy all of a user’s needs, the user will not care whether there exists a large number of other applications that are directly compatible with the underlying operating system.  Thus, the growth of middleware-based applications could lower the costs to users of choosing a non-Intel-compatible PC operating system like the Mac OS.  It remains to be seen, though, whether there will ever be a sustained stream of full-featured applications written solely to middleware APIs.   In any event, it would take several years for middlware and the applications it supports to evolve from the status quo to a point at which the cost to the average consumer of choosing a non-Intel compatible PC operating system over an Intel-compatible one falls so low as to constrain the pricing of the latter systems.</span></p><p><span>B.The Possibility of Supply Responses</span></p><p><span>30.Firms that do not currently produce Intel-compatible PC operating systems could do so.  What is more, once a firm had written the necessary software code, it could produce millions of copies of its operating system at relatively low cost.  The ability to meet a large demand is useless, however, if the demand for the product is small, and signs do not indicate large demand for a new Intel-compatible PC operating system.  To the contrary, they indicate that the demand for a new Intel-compatible PC operating system would be severely constrained by an intractable “chicken-and-egg” problem:  The overwhelming majority of consumers will only use a PC operating system for which there already exists a large and varied set of high-quality, full-</span></p><p><span>featured applications, and for which it seems relatively certain that new types of applications and new versions of existing applications will continue to be marketed at pace with those written for other operating systems.  Unfortunately for firms whose products do not fit that bill, the porting of applications from one operating system to another is a costly process.  Consequently, software developers generally write applications first, and often exclusively, for the operating system that is already used by a dominant share of all PC users.  Users do not want to invest in an operating system until it is clear that the system will support generations of applications that will meet their needs, and developers do not want to invest in writing or quickly porting applications for an operating system until it is clear that there will be a sizeable and stable market for it.  What is more, consumers who already use one Intel-compatible PC operating system are even less likely than first-time buyers to choose a newcomer to the field, for switching to a new system would require these users to scrap the investment they have made in applications, training, and certain hardware.</span></p><p><span>31.The chicken-and-egg problem notwithstanding, a firm might reasonably expect to make a profit by introducing an Intel-compatible PC operating system designed to support a type of application that satisfies the special interests of a particular subset of users.  For example, Be, Inc. (‘Be”) markets an Intel-compatible PC operating system called BeOS that offers superior support for multimedia applications, and the operating system enjoys a certain amount of success with the segment of the consumer population that has a special interest in creating and playing multimedia content with a PC system.  Still, while a niche operating system might turn a profit, the chicken-and-egg problem (hereinafter referred to as the “applications barrier to entry”) would make it prohibitively expensive for a new Intel-compatible operating system to attract enough developers and consumers to become a viable alternative to a dominant incumbent in less than a few years.</span></p><p><span>32.To the extent that developers begin writing attractive applications that rely solely on servers or middleware instead of PC operating systems, the applications barrier to entry could erode.  As the Court finds above, however, it remains to be seen whether server- or middleware-</span></p><p><span>based development will flourish at all.  Even if such development were already flourishing, it would be several years before the applications barrier eroded enough to clear the way for the relatively rapid emergence of a viable alternative to incumbent Intel-compatible PC operating systems.  It is highly unlikely, then, that a firm not already marketing an Intel-compatible PC operating system could begin marketing one that would, in less than a few years, present a significant percentage of consumers with a viable alternative to incumbents.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span/></p><p><span>III.MICROSOFT’S POWER IN THE RELEVANT MARKET</span></p><p><span>33.Microsoft enjoys so much power in the market for Intel-compatible PC operating systems that if it wished to exercise this power solely in terms of price, it could charge a price for Windows substantially above that which could be charged in a competitive market.  Moreover, it could do so for a significant period of time without losing an unacceptable amount of business to competitors.  In other words, Microsoft enjoys monopoly power in the relevant market.</span></p><p><span>34.Viewed together, three main facts indicate that Microsoft enjoys monopoly power.  First, Microsoft’s share of the market for Intel-compatible PC operating systems is extremely large and stable.  Second, Microsoft’s dominant market share is protected by a high barrier to entry.  Third, and largely as a result of that barrier, Microsoft’s customers lack a commercially viable alternative to Windows.</span></p><p><span>A.Market Share</span></p><p><span>35.Microsoft possesses a dominant, persistent, and increasing share of the world-wide market for Intel-compatible PC operating systems.  Every year for the last decade, Microsoft’s share of the market for Intel-compatible PC operating systems has stood above ninety percent.  For the last couple of years the figure has been at least ninety-five percent, and analysts project that the share will climb even higher over the next few years.  Even if Apple’s Mac OS were included in the relevant market, Microsoft’s share would still stand well above eighty percent.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span/></p><p><span/></p><p><span>B.The Applications Barrier to Entry</span></p><p><span>1.Description</span><span/><span>of the Applications Barrier to Entry</span></p><p><span>36.Microsoft’s dominant market share is protected by the same barrier that helps define the market for Intel-compatible PC operating systems.  As explained above, the applications barrier would prevent an aspiring entrant into the relevant market from drawing a significant number of customers away from a dominant incumbent even if the incumbent priced its products substantially above competitive levels for a significant period of time.  Because Microsoft’s market share is so dominant, the barrier has a similar effect within the market:  It prevents Intel-compatible PC operating systems other than Windows from attracting significant consumer demand, and it would continue to do so even if Microsoft held its prices substantially above the competitive level.</span></p><p><span>37.Consumer interest in a PC operating system derives primarily from the ability of that system to run applications.  The consumer wants an operating system that runs not only types of applications that he knows he will want to use, but also those types in which he might develop an interest later.  Also, the consumer knows that if he chooses an operating system with enough demand to support multiple applications in each product category, he will be less likely to find himself straitened later by having to use an application whose features disappoint him.  Finally, the average user knows that, generally speaking, applications improve through successive versions.  He thus wants an operating system for which successive generations of his favorite applications will be released — promptly at that.  The fact that a vastly larger number of applications are written for Windows than for other PC operating systems attracts consumers to Windows, because it reassures them that their interests will be met as long as they use Microsoft’s product.</span></p><p><span>38.Software development is characterized by substantial economies of scale.  The fixed costs of producing software, including applications, is very high.  By contrast, marginal costs are very low.  Moreover, the costs of developing software are “sunk” — once expended to develop software, resources so devoted cannot be used for another purpose.  The result of economies of scale and sunk costs is that application developers seek to sell as many copies of their applications as possible.  An application that is written for one PC operating system will operate on another PC operating system only if it is ported to that system, and porting applications is both time-consuming and expensive.  Therefore, application developers tend to write first to the operating system with the most users — Windows.  Developers might then port their applications to other operating systems, but only to the extent that the marginal added sales justify the cost of porting.  In order to recover that cost, ISVs that do go to the effort of porting frequently set the price of ported applications considerably higher than that of the original versions written for Windows.</span></p><p><span>39.Consumer demand for Windows enjoys positive network effects.  A positive network effect is a phenomenon by which the attractiveness of a product increases with the number of people using it.  The fact that there is a multitude of people using Windows makes the product more attractive to consumers.  The large installed base attracts corporate customers who want to use an operating system that new employees are already likely to know how to use, and it attracts academic consumers who want to use software that will allow them to share files easily with colleagues at other institutions.  The main reason that demand for Windows experiences positive network effects, however, is that the size of Windows’ installed base impels ISVs to write applications first and foremost to Windows, thereby ensuring a large body of applications from which consumers can choose.  The large body of applications thus reinforces demand for Windows, augmenting Microsoft’s dominant position and thereby perpetuating ISV incentives to write applications principally for Windows.  This self-reinforcing cycle is often referred to as a “positive feedback loop.”</span></p><p><span>40.What for Microsoft is a positive feedback loop is for would-be competitors a vicious cycle.  For just as Microsoft’s large market share creates incentives for ISVs to develop applications first and foremost for Windows, the small or non-existent market share of an aspiring competitor makes it prohibitively expensive for the aspirant to develop its PC operating system into an acceptable substitute for Windows.  To provide a viable substitute for Windows, another PC operating system would need a large and varied enough base of compatible applications to reassure consumers that their interests in variety, choice, and currency would be met to more-or-</span></p><p><span>less the same extent as if they chose Windows.  Even if the contender attracted several thousand compatible applications, it would still look like a gamble from the consumer’s perspective next to Windows, which supports over 70,000 applications.  The amount it would cost an operating system vendor to create that many applications is prohibitively large.  Therefore, in order to ensure the availability of a set of applications comparable to that available for Windows, a potential rival would need to induce a very large number of ISVs to write to its operating system.  </span></p><p><span>41.In deciding whether to develop an application for a new operating system, an ISV’s first consideration is the number of users it expects the operating system to attract.  Out of this focus arises a collective-action problem:  Each ISV realizes that the new operating system could attract a significant number of users if enough ISVs developed applications for it; but few ISVs want to sink resources into developing for the system until it becomes established.  Since everyone is waiting for everyone else to bear the risk of early adoption, the new operating system has difficulty attracting enough applications to generate a positive feedback loop.  The vendor of a new operating system cannot effectively solve this problem by paying the necessary number of ISVs to write for its operating system, because the cost of doing so would dwarf the expected return.</span></p><p><span>42.Counteracting the collective-action phenomenon is another known as the “first-</span></p><p><span>mover incentive.”  For an ISV interested in attracting users, there may be an advantage to offering the first and, for a while, only application in its category that runs on a new PC operating system.  The user base of the new system may be small, but every user of that system who wants such an application will be compelled to use the ISV’s offering.  Moreover, if demand for the new operating system suddenly explodes, the first mover will reap large sales before any competitors arrive.  An ISV thus might be drawn to a new PC operating system as a “protected harbor.”  Once first-movers stake claims to the major categories of applications, however, there is a strong chance that the new operating system could stall; it would not support the most familiar applications, nor the variety and number of applications, that attract large numbers of consumers, and there would no longer exist a first-mover incentive to attract additional ISVs to the important application categories.  Although the upstart operating system might find itself with enough applications support to hold a fraction of the market, the collective-action phenomenon would still prevent the system from gaining the kind of positive feedback momentum that can turn a fringe entrant into a rival that would put competitive pressure on Windows.</span></p><p><span>43.The cost to a would-be entrant of inducing ISVs to write applications for its operating system exceeds the cost that Microsoft itself has faced in inducing ISVs to write applications for its operating system products, for Microsoft never confronted a highly penetrated market dominated by a single competitor.  Of course, the fact that it is extremely difficult for an efficient would-be rival to accumulate enough applications support to compete with Windows does not mean that sustaining its own applications support is effortless for Microsoft.  In fact, if Microsoft stopped investing the hundreds of millions of dollars it spends each year inducing ISVs to write applications for Windows, it might become easier than it currently is for a competitor to develop its own positive feedback loop.  But given that Windows today enjoys overwhelmingly more applications support than any other PC operating system, it would still take that competitor years to develop the necessary momentum.  Plus, while Microsoft may spend more on platform “evangelization,” even in relative terms, than any other PC operating-system vendor, it is not difficult to understand why it is worthwhile for the principal beneficiary of the applications barrier to devote more resources to augmenting it than aspiring rivals are willing to expend in speculative efforts to erode it.</span></p><p><span>44.Microsoft continually releases “new and improved” versions of its PC operating system.  Each time it does, Microsoft must convince ISVs to write applications that take advantage of new APIs, so that existing Windows users will have incentive to buy an upgrade.  Since ISVs are usually still earning substantial revenue from applications written for the last version of Windows, Microsoft must convince them to write for the new version.  Even if ISVs are slow to take advantage of the new APIs, though, no applications barrier stands in the way of consumers adopting the new system, for Microsoft ensures that successive versions of Windows retain the ability to run applications developed for earlier versions.  In fact, since ISVs know that consumers do not feel locked into their old versions of Windows and that new versions have historically attracted substantial consumer demand, ISVs will generally write to new APIs as long as the interfaces enable attractive, innovative features.  Microsoft supplements developers’ incentives by extending various ‘seals of approval’ — visible to consumers, investors, and industry analysts — to those ISVs that promptly develop new versions of their applications adapted to the newest version of Windows.  In addition, Microsoft works closely with ISVs to help them adapt their applications to the newest version of the operating system — a process that is in any event far easier than porting an application from one vendor’s PC operating system to another’s.  In sum, despite the substantial resources Microsoft expends inducing ISVs to develop applications for new versions of Windows, the company does not face any obstacles nearly as imposing as the barrier to entry that vendors and would-be vendors of other PC operating systems must overcome.</span></p><p><span>2.Empirical Evidence</span><span/><span>of the Applications Barrier to Entry</span></p><p><span>45.The experiences of IBM and Apple, Microsoft’s most significant operating system rivals in the mid- and late 1990s, confirm the strength of the applications barrier to entry.</span></p><p><span>a.OS/2 Warp</span></p><p><span>46.IBM’s inability to gain widespread developer support for its OS/2 Warp operating system illustrates how the massive Windows installed base makes it prohibitively costly for a rival operating system to attract enough developer support to challenge Windows.  In late 1994, IBM introduced its Intel-compatible OS/2 Warp operating system and spent tens of millions of dollars in an effort to attract ISVs to develop applications for OS/2 and in an attempt to reverse-engineer, or “clone,” part of the Windows API set.  Despite these efforts, IBM could obtain neither significant market share nor ISV support for OS/2 Warp.  Thus, although at its peak OS/2 ran approximately 2,500 applications and had 10% of the market for Intel-compatible PC operating systems, IBM ultimately determined that the applications barrier prevented effective competition against Windows 95.  For that reason, in 1996 IBM stopped trying to convince ISVs to write for OS/2 Warp.  IBM now targets the product at a market niche, namely enterprise customers (mainly banks) that are interested in particular types of application that run on OS/2 Warp.  The fact that IBM no longer tries to compete with Windows is evidenced by the fact that it prices OS/2 Warp at about two-and-one-half times the price of Windows 98.</span></p><p><span>b.The Mac OS</span></p><p><span>47.The inability of Apple to compete effectively with Windows provides another example of the applications barrier to entry in operation.  Although Apple’s Mac OS supports more than 12,000 applications, even an inventory of that magnitude is not sufficient to enable Apple to present a significant percentage of users with a viable substitute for Windows.  The absence of a large installed base, in turn, reinforces the disparity between the applications made available for the Mac OS and those made available for Windows, further inhibiting Apple’s sales.  The applications barrier thus prevents the Mac OS from hindering Microsoft’s ability to control price, regardless of whether the Mac OS is regarded as being in the relevant market or not.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>c.Fringe Operating Systems</span></p><p><span>48.The applications barrier to entry does not prevent non-Microsoft, Intel-compatible PC operating systems from attracting enough consumer demand and ISV support to survive.  It does not even prevent vendors of those products from making a profit.  The barrier does, however, prevent the products from drawing a significant percentage of consumers away from Windows. </span></p><p><span>49.As discussed above, Be markets an Intel-compatible PC operating system, called BeOS, that is specially suited to support multimedia functions.  The operating system survives on a relatively minuscule number of applications (approximately 1,000) and a user base which, at around 750,000, is trivial compared to the number of Windows users.  One of the reasons the BeOS can even attract that many users despite its small base of applications is that it advertises itself as a complement to, rather than as a substitute for, Windows.  Although the BeOS could run an Intel-compatible PC system without Windows, it is almost always loaded on a system along with Windows.  What is more, when these dual-loaded PC systems are turned on, Windows automatically boots; the user must then take affirmative steps to invoke the BeOS.  While this scheme allows the BeOS to occupy a niche in the market, it does not place the product on a trajectory to replace Windows on a significant number of PCs.  The special multimedia support provided by the BeOS may, for a small number of users, outweigh the disadvantages of maintaining two large, complex operating systems on one PC.  Of that group, however, it is likely that only a tiny number of users will find that support so attractive that they would be willing to forego Windows, and its huge base of compatible applications, altogether.  </span></p><p><span>50.The experience of the Linux operating system, a version of which runs on Intel-</span></p><p><span>compatible PCs, similarly fails to refute the existence of an applications barrier to entry.  Linux is an “open source” operating system that was created, and is continuously updated, by a global network of software developers who contribute their labor for free.  Although Linux has between ten and fifteen million users, the majority of them use the operating system to run servers, not PCs.  Several ISVs have announced their development of (or plans to develop) Linux versions of their applications.  To date, though, legions of ISVs have not followed the lead of these first movers.  Similarly, consumers have by and large shown little inclination to abandon Windows, with its reliable developer support, in favor of an operating system whose future in the PC realm is unclear.  By itself, Linux’s open-source development model shows no signs of liberating that operating system from the cycle of consumer preferences and developer incentives that, when fueled by Windows’ enormous reservoir of applications, prevents non-Microsoft operating systems from competing. </span></p><p><span>3.Open-Source Applications Development</span></p><p><span>51.Since application developers working under an open-source model are not looking to recoup their investment and make a profit by selling copies of their finished products, they are free from the imperative that compels proprietary developers to concentrate their efforts on Windows.  In theory, then, open-source developers are at least as likely to develop applications for a non-Microsoft operating system as they are to write Windows-compatible applications.  In fact, they may be disposed ideologically to focus their efforts on open-source platforms like Linux.  Fortunately for Microsoft, however, there are only so many developers in the world willing to devote their talents to writing, testing, and debugging software </span><span>pro</span><span/><span>bono</span><span/><span>publico</span><span>.  A small corps may be willing to concentrate its efforts on popular applications, such as browsers and office productivity applications, that are of value to most users.  It is unlikely, though, that a sufficient number of open-source developers will commit to developing and continually updating the large variety of applications that an operating system would need to attract in order to present a significant number of users with a viable alternative to Windows.  In practice, then, the open-source model of applications development may increase the base of applications that run on non-</span></p><p><span>Microsoft PC operating systems, but it cannot dissolve the barrier that prevents such operating systems from challenging Windows.</span></p><p><span>4.Cloning the 32-Bit Windows APIs</span></p><p><span>52.Theoretically, the developer of a non-Microsoft, Intel-compatible PC operating system could circumvent the applications barrier to entry by cloning the APIs exposed by the 32-</span></p><p><span>bit versions of Windows (Windows 9x and Windows NT).  Applications written for Windows would then also run on the rival system, and consumers could use the rival system confident in that knowledge.  Translating this theory into practice is virtually impossible, however.  First of all, cloning the thousands of APIs already exposed by Windows would be an enormously expensive undertaking.  More daunting is the fact that Microsoft continually adds APIs to Windows through updates and new versions.  By the time a rival finished cloning the APIs currently in existence, Windows would have exposed a multitude of new ones.  Since the rival would never catch up, it would never be able to assure consumers that its operating system would run all of the applications written for Windows.  IBM discovered this to its dismay in the mid-1990s when it failed, despite a massive investment, to clone a sufficiently large part of the 32-bit Windows APIs.  In short, attempting to clone the 32-bit Windows APIs is such an expensive, uncertain undertaking that it fails to present a practical option for a would-be competitor to Windows.</span></p><p><span>C.Viable Alternatives to Windows</span></p><p><span>53.That Microsoft’s market share and the applications barrier to entry together endow the company with monopoly power in the market for Intel-compatible PC operating systems is directly evidenced by the sustained absence of realistic commercial alternatives to Microsoft’s PC operating-system products.</span></p><p><span>54.OEMs are the most important direct customers for operating systems for Intel-</span></p><p><span>compatible PCs.  Because competition among OEMs is intense, they pay particularly close attention to consumer demand.  OEMs are thus not only important customers in their own right, they are also surrogates for consumers in identifying reasonably-available commercial alternatives to Windows.  Without significant exception, all OEMs pre-install Windows on the vast majority of PCs that they sell, and they uniformly are of a mind that there exists no commercially viable alternative to which they could switch in response to a substantial and sustained price increase or its equivalent by Microsoft.  For example, in 1995, at a time when IBM still placed hope in OS/2's ability to rival Windows, the firm nevertheless calculated that its PC company would lose between seventy and ninety percent of its sales volume if failed to load Windows 95 on its PCs.  Although a few OEMs have announced their intention to pre-install Linux on some of the computers they ship, none of them plan to install Linux in lieu of Windows on any appreciable number of PC (as opposed to server) systems.  For its part, Be is not even attempting to persuade OEMs to install the BeOS on PCs to the exclusion of Windows.</span></p><p><span>55.OEMs believe that the likelihood of a viable alternative to Windows emerging any time in the next few years is too low to constrain Microsoft from raising prices or imposing other burdens on customers and users.  The accuracy of this belief is highlighted by the fact that the other vendors of Intel-compatible PC operating systems do not view their own offerings as viable alternatives to Windows.  Microsoft knows that OEMs have no choice but to load Windows, both because it has a good understanding of the market in which it operates and because OEMs have told Microsoft as much.  Indicative of Microsoft’s assessment of the situation is the fact that, in a 1996 presentation to the firm’s executive committee, the Microsoft executive in charge of OEM licensing reported that piracy continued to be the main competition to the company’s operating system products.  Secure in this knowledge, Microsoft did not consider the prices of other Intel-</span></p><p><span>compatible PC operating systems when it set the price of Windows 98. </span></p><p><span>56.As the Court found above, the growth of server- and middleware-based applications development might eventually weaken the applications barrier to entry.  This would not only make it easier for outside firms to enter the market, it could also make it easier for non-</span></p><p><span>Microsoft firms already in the market to present a viable alternative to Windows.  But as the Court also found above, it is not clear whether ISVs will ever develop a large, diverse body of full-featured applications that rely solely on APIs exposed by servers and middleware.  Furthermore, even assuming that such a movement has already begun in earnest, it will take several years for the applications barrier to erode enough to enable a non-Microsoft, Intel-</span></p><p><span>compatible PC operating system to develop into a viable alternative to Windows.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span/></p><p><span>D.Price Restraint Posed by Microsoft’s Installed Base</span><span/></p><p><span>57.Software never expires, so consumers who already have a version of Windows with which they are content and who are not shopping for a new PC system are somewhat reluctant to incur the cost of upgrading to a new version of Windows.  Fortunately for Microsoft, the pace of innovation in PC hardware is rapid, and the price of that hardware has declined steadily in recent years.  As a result, existing PC users buy new PC systems relatively frequently, and OEMs still attract at a healthy rate buyers who have never owned a computer.  The license for one of Microsoft’s operating system products prohibits the user from transferring the operating system to another machine, so there is no legal secondary market in Microsoft operating systems.  This means that any consumer who buys a new Intel-compatible PC and wants Windows must buy a new copy of the operating system.  Microsoft takes pains to ensure that the versions of its operating system that OEMs pre-install on new PC systems are the most current.  It does this, in part, by increasing the price to OEMs of older versions of Windows when the newer versions are released.  Since Microsoft can sell so many copies of each new operating system through the sales of new PC systems, the average price it sets for those systems is little affected by the fact that older versions of Windows never wear out.</span></p><p><span>E.Price Restraint Posed by Piracy</span></p><p><span>58.Although there is no legal secondary market for Microsoft’s PC operating systems, there is a thriving illegal one.  Software pirates illegally copy software products such as Windows, selling each copy for a fraction of the vendor’s usual price.  One of the ways Microsoft combats piracy is by advising OEMs that they will be charged a higher price for Windows unless they drastically limit the number of PCs that they sell without an operating system pre-installed.  In 1998, all major OEMs agreed to this restriction.  Naturally, it is hard to sell a pirated copy of Windows to a consumer who has already received a legal copy included in the price of his new PC system.  Thus, Microsoft is able to effectively contain, if not extinguish, the illegal secondary market for its operating-system products.  So even though Microsoft is more concerned about piracy than it is about other firms’ operating system products, the company’s pricing is not substantially constrained by the need to reduce the incentives for consumers to acquire their copies of Windows illegally.</span></p><p><span>F.Price Restraint Posed by Long-Term Threats</span></p><p><span>59.The software industry in general is characterized by dynamic, vigorous competition.  In many cases, one of the early entrants into a new software category quickly captures a lion’s share of the sales, while other products in the category are either driven out altogether or relegated to niche positions.  What eventually displaces the leader is often not competition from another product within the same software category, but rather a technological advance that renders the boundaries defining the category obsolete.  These events, in which categories are redefined and leaders are superseded in the process, are spoken of as “inflection points.”</span></p><p><span>60.The exponential growth of the Internet represents an inflection point born of complementary technological advances in the computer and telecommunications industries.  The rise of the Internet in turn has fueled the growth of server-based computing, middleware, and open-source software development.  Working together, these nascent paradigms could oust the PC operating system from its position as the primary platform for applications development and the main interface between users and their computers.  Microsoft recognizes that new paradigms could arise to depreciate the value of selling PC operating systems; however, the fact that these new paradigms already exist in embryonic or primitive form does not prevent Microsoft from enjoying monopoly power today.  For while consumers might one day turn to network computers, or Linux, or a combination of middleware and some other operating system, as an alternative to Windows, the fact remains that they are not doing so today.  Nor are consumers likely to do so in appreciable numbers any time in the next few years.  Unless and until that day arrives, no significant percentage of consumers will be able to abandon Windows without incurring substantial costs.  Microsoft can therefore set the price of Windows substantially higher than that which would be charged in a competitive market — or impose other burdens on consumers — without losing so much business as to make the action unprofitable.   If Microsoft exerted its power solely to raise price, the day when users could turn away from Windows without incurring substantial costs would still be several years distant.  Moreover, Microsoft could keep its prices high for a significant period of time and still lower them in time to meet the threat of a new paradigm.  Alternatively, Microsoft could delay the arrival of a new paradigm on the scene by expending surplus monopoly power in ways other than the maintenance of high prices.</span></p><p><span>G.Significance of Microsoft’s Innovation</span></p><p><span>61.The fact that Microsoft invests heavily in research and development does not evidence a lack of monopoly power.  Indeed, Microsoft has incentives to innovate aggressively despite its monopoly power.  First, if there are innovations that will make Intel-compatible PC systems attractive to more consumers, and those consumers less sensitive to the price of Windows, the innovations will translate into increased profits for Microsoft.  Second, although Microsoft could significantly restrict its investment in innovation and still not face a viable alternative to Windows for several years, it can push the emergence of competition even farther into the future by continuing to innovate aggressively.  While Microsoft may not be able to stave off all potential paradigm shifts through innovation, it can thwart some and delay others by improving its own products to the greater satisfaction of consumers.</span></p><p><span>H.Microsoft’s Pricing Behavior</span></p><p><span>62.Microsoft’s actual pricing behavior is consistent with the proposition that the firm enjoys monopoly power in the market for Intel-compatible PC operating systems.  The company’s decision not to consider the prices of other vendors’ Intel-compatible PC operating systems when setting the price of Windows 98, for example, is probative of monopoly power.  One would expect a firm in a competitive market to pay much closer attention to the prices charged by other firms in the market.  Another indication of monopoly power is the fact that Microsoft raised the price that it charged OEMs for Windows 95, with trivial exceptions, to the same level as the price it charged for Windows 98 just prior to releasing the newer product.  In a competitive market, one would expect the price of an older operating system to stay the same or decrease upon the release of a newer, more attractive version.  Microsoft, however, was only concerned with inducing OEMs to ship Windows 98 in favor of the older version.  It is unlikely that Microsoft would have imposed this price increase if it were genuinely concerned that OEMs might shift their business to another vendor of operating systems or hasten the development of viable alternatives to Windows.  </span></p><p><span>63.Finally, it is indicative of monopoly power that Microsoft felt that it had substantial discretion in setting the price of its Windows 98 upgrade product (the operating system product it sells to existing users of Windows 95).  A Microsoft study from November 1997 reveals that the company could have charged $49 for an upgrade to Windows 98 — there is no reason to believe that the $49 price would have been unprofitable — but the study identifies $89 as the revenue-</span></p><p><span>maximizing price.  Microsoft thus opted for the higher price.</span></p><p><span>64.An aspect of Microsoft’s pricing behavior that, while not tending to prove monopoly power, is consistent with it is the fact that the firm charges different OEMs different prices for Windows, depending on the degree to which the individual OEMs comply with Microsoft’s wishes.  Among the five largest OEMs, Gateway and IBM, which in various ways have resisted Microsoft’s efforts to enlist them in its efforts to preserve the applications barrier to entry, pay higher prices than Compaq, Dell, and Hewlett-Packard, which have pursued less contentious relationships with Microsoft.</span></p><p><span>65.It is not possible with the available data to determine with any level of confidence whether the price that a profit-maximizing firm with monopoly power would charge for Windows 98 comports with the price that Microsoft actually charges.  Even if it could be determined that Microsoft charges less than the profit-maximizing monopoly price, though, that would not be probative of a lack of monopoly power, for Microsoft could be charging what seems like a low short-term price in order to maximize its profits in the future for reasons unrelated to underselling any incipient competitors.  For instance, Microsoft could be stimulating the growth of the market for Intel-compatible PC operating systems by keeping the price of Windows low today.  Given the size and stability of its market share, Microsoft stands to reap almost all of the future rewards if there are yet more consumers of Intel-compatible PC operating systems.  By pricing low relative to the short-run profit-maximizing price, thereby focusing on attracting new users to the Windows platform, Microsoft would also intensify the positive network effects that add to the impenetrability of the applications barrier to entry.  </span></p><p><span>66.Furthermore, Microsoft expends a significant portion of its monopoly power, which could otherwise be spent maximizing price, on imposing burdensome restrictions on its customers — and in inducing them to behave in ways — that augment and prolong that monopoly power.  For example, Microsoft attaches to a Windows license conditions that restrict the ability of OEMs to promote software that Microsoft believes could weaken the applications barrier to entry.  Microsoft also charges a lower price to OEMs who agree to ensure that all of their Windows machines are powerful enough to run Windows NT for Workstations.  To the extent this provision induces OEMs to concentrate their efforts on the development of relatively powerful, expensive PCs, it makes OEMs less likely to pursue simultaneously the opposite path of developing “thin client” systems, which could threaten demand for Microsoft’s Intel-compatible PC operating system products.  In addition, Microsoft charges a lower price to OEMs who agree to ship all but a minute fraction of their machines with an operating system pre-installed.  While this helps combat piracy, it also makes it less likely that consumers will detect increases in the price of Windows and renders operating systems not pre-installed by OEMs in large numbers even less attractive to consumers.  After all, a consumer’s interest in a non-Windows operating system might not outweigh the burdens on system memory and performance associated with supporting two operating systems on a single PC.  Other such restrictions and incentives are described below.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span/></p><p><span>I.Microsoft’s Actions Toward Other Firms</span></p><p><span>67.Microsoft’s monopoly power is also evidenced by the fact that, over the course of several years, Microsoft took actions that could only have been advantageous if they operated to reinforce monopoly power.  These actions are described below.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>IV.THE MIDDLEWARE THREATS</span></p><p><span>68.</span><span>Middleware technologies, as previously noted, have the potential to weaken the applications barrier to entry.  Microsoft was apprehensive that the APIs exposed by middleware technologies would attract so much developer interest, and would become so numerous and varied, that there would arise a substantial and growing number of full-featured applications that relied largely, or even wholly, on middleware APIs.  The applications relying largely on middleware APIs would potentially be relatively easy to port from one operating system to another.  The applications relying exclusively on middleware APIs would run, as written, on any operating system hosting the requisite middleware.  So the more popular middleware became and the more APIs it exposed, the more the positive feedback loop that sustains the applications barrier to entry would dissipate.  Microsoft was concerned with middleware as a category of software; each type of middleware contributed to the threat posed by the entire category.  At the same time, Microsoft focused its antipathy on two incarnations of middleware that, working together, had the potential to weaken the applications barrier severely without the assistance of any other middleware.  These were Netscape’s Web browser and Sun’s implementation of the Java technologies.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>A.The Netscape Web browser</span></p><p><span>69.Netscape Navigator possesses three key middleware attributes that endow it with the potential to diminish the applications barrier to entry.  First, in contrast to non-Microsoft, Intel-compatible PC operating systems, which few users would want to use on the same PC systems that carry their copies of Windows, a browser can gain widespread use based on its value as a complement to Windows.  Second, because Navigator exposes a set (albeit a limited one) of APIs, it can serve as a platform for other software used by consumers.  A browser product is particularly well positioned to serve as a platform for network-centric applications that run in association with Web pages.  Finally, Navigator has been ported to more than fifteen different operating systems.  Thus, if a developer writes an application that relies solely on the APIs exposed by Navigator, that application will, without any porting, run on many different operating systems.</span></p><p><span>70.Adding to Navigator’s potential to weaken the applications barrier to entry is the fact that the Internet has become both a major inducement for consumers to buy PCs for the first time and a major occupier of the time and attention of current PCs users.  For any firm looking to turn its browser product into an applications platform such to rival Windows, the intense consumer interest in all things Internet-related is a great boon.</span></p><p><span>71.Microsoft knew in the fall of 1994 that Netscape was developing versions of a Web browser to run on different operating systems.  It did not yet know, however, that Netscape would employ Navigator to generate revenue directly, much less that the product would evolve in such a way as to threaten Microsoft.  In fact, in late December 1994, Netscape’s chairman and chief executive officer (“CEO”), Jim Clark, told a Microsoft executive that the focus of Netscape’s business would be applications running on servers and that Netscape did not intend to succeed at Microsoft’s expense.</span></p><p><span>72.As soon as Netscape released Navigator on December 15, 1994, the product began to enjoy dramatic acceptance by the public; shortly after its release, consumers were already using Navigator far more than any other browser product.  This alarmed Microsoft, which feared that Navigator’s enthusiastic reception could embolden Netscape to develop Navigator into an alternative platform for applications development.  In late May 1995, Bill Gates, the chairman and CEO of Microsoft, sent a memorandum entitled “The Internet Tidal Wave” to Microsoft’s executives describing Netscape as a “new competitor ‘born’ on the Internet.”  He warned his colleagues within Microsoft that Netscape was “pursuing a multi-platform strategy where they move the key API into the client to commoditize the underlying operating system.”  By the late spring of 1995, the executives responsible for setting Microsoft’s corporate strategy were deeply concerned that Netscape was moving its business in a direction that could diminish the applications barrier to entry.</span></p><p><span>B.Sun’s Implementation of the Java Technologies</span></p><p><span>73.The term “Java” refers to four interlocking elements.  First, there is a Java programming language with which developers can write applications.  Second, there is a set of programs written in Java that expose APIs on which developers writing in Java can rely.  These programs are called the “Java class libraries.”  The third element is the Java compiler, which translates the code written by the developer into Java “bytecode.”  Finally, there are programs called “Java virtual machines,” or “JVMs,” which translate Java bytecode into instructions comprehensible to the underlying operating system.  If the Java class libraries and a JVM are present on a PC system, the system is said to carry a “Java runtime environment.”</span></p><p><span>74.The inventors of Java at Sun Microsystems intended the technology to enable applications written in the Java language to run on a variety of platforms with minimal porting.  A program written in Java and relying only on APIs exposed by the Java class libraries will run on any PC system containing a JVM that has itself been ported to the resident operating system.  Therefore, Java developers need to port their applications only to the extent that those applications rely directly on the APIs exposed by a particular operating system.  The more an application written in Java relies on APIs exposed by the Java class libraries, the less work its developer will need to do to port the application to different operating systems.  The easier it is for developers to port their applications to different operating systems, the more applications will be written for operating systems other than Windows.  To date, the Java class libraries do not expose enough APIs to support the development of full-featured applications that will run well on multiple operating systems without the need for porting; however, they do allow relatively simple, network-centric applications to be written cross-platform.  It is Sun’s ultimate ambition to expand the class libraries to such an extent that many full-featured, end-user-oriented applications will be written cross-platform.  The closer Sun gets to this goal of “write once, run anywhere,” the more the applications barrier to entry will erode.</span></p><p><span>75.Sun announced in May 1995 that it had developed the Java programming language.  Mid-level executives at Microsoft began to express concern about Sun’s Java vision in the fall of that year, and by late spring of 1996, senior Microsoft executives were deeply worried about the potential of Sun’s Java technologies to diminish the applications barrier to entry.</span></p><p><span>76.Sun’s strategy could only succeed if a Java runtime environment that complied with Sun’s standards found its way onto PC systems running Windows.  Sun could not count on Microsoft to ship with Windows an implementation of the Java runtime environment that threatened the applications barrier to entry.  Fortunately for Sun, Netscape agreed in May 1995 to include a copy of Sun’s Java runtime environment with every copy of Navigator, and Navigator quickly became the principal vehicle by which Sun placed copies of its Java runtime environment on the PC systems of Windows users.</span></p><p><span>77.The combined efforts of Netscape and Sun threatened to hasten the demise of the applications barrier to entry, opening the way for non-Microsoft operating systems to emerge as acceptable substitutes for Windows.  By stimulating the development of network-centric Java applications accessible to users through browser products, the collaboration of Netscape and Sun also heralded the day when vendors of information appliances and network computers could present users with viable alternatives to PCs themselves.  Nevertheless, these middleware technologies have a long way to go before they might imperil the applications barrier to entry.  Windows 98 exposes nearly ten thousand APIs, whereas the combined APIs of Navigator and the Java class libraries, together representing the greatest hope for proponents of middleware, total less than a thousand.  Decision-makers at Microsoft are apprehensive of potential as well as present threats, though, and in 1995 the implications of the symbiosis between Navigator and Sun’s Java implementation were not lost on executives at Microsoft, who viewed Netscape’s cooperation with Sun as a further reason to dread the increasing use of Navigator.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span/></p><p><span>C.Other Middleware Threats</span></p><p><span>78.</span><span>Although they have been the most prominent, Netscape’s Navigator and Sun’s Java implementation are not the only manifestations of middleware that Microsoft has perceived as having the potential to weaken the applications barrier to entry.  Starting in 1994, Microsoft exhibited considerable concern over the software product Notes, distributed first by Lotus and then by IBM.  Microsoft worried about Notes for several reasons:  It presented a graphical interface that was common across multiple operating systems; it also exposed a set of APIs to developers; and, like Navigator, it served as a distribution vehicle for Sun’s Java runtime environment.  Then in 1995, Microsoft reacted with alarm to Intel’s Native Signal Processing software, which interacted with the microprocessor independently of the operating system and exposed APIs directly to developers of multimedia content.  Finally, in 1997 Microsoft noted the dangers of Apple’s and RealNetworks’ multimedia playback technologies, which ran on several platforms (including the Mac OS and Windows) and similarly exposed APIs to content developers.  Microsoft feared all of these technologies because they facilitated the development of user-oriented software that would be indifferent to the identity of the underlying operating system.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>V.MICROSOFT’S RESPONSE TO THE BROWSER THREAT</span></p><p><span>A.Microsoft’s Attempt to Dissuade Netscape from Developing Navigator as a Platform</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>79.Microsoft’s first response to the threat posed by Navigator was an effort to persuade Netscape to structure its business such that the company would not distribute platform-</span></p><p><span>level browsing software for Windows.  Netscape’s assent would have ensured that, for the foreseeable future, Microsoft would produce the only platform-level browsing software distributed to run on Windows.  This would have eliminated the prospect that non-Microsoft browsing software could weaken the applications barrier to entry.</span></p><p><span>80.Executives at Microsoft received confirmation in early May 1995 that Netscape was developing a version of Navigator to run on Windows 95, which was due to be released in a couple of months.  Microsoft’s senior executives understood that if they could prevent this version of Navigator from presenting alternatives to the Internet-related APIs in Windows 95, the technologies branded as Navigator would cease to present an alternative platform to developers.  Even if non-Windows versions of Navigator exposed Internet-related APIs, applications written to those APIs would not run on the platform Microsoft executives expected to enjoy the largest installed base, </span><span>i.e.</span><span>, Windows 95.  So, as long as the version of Navigator written for Windows 95 relied on Microsoft’s Internet-related APIs instead of exposing its own, developing for Navigator would not mean developing cross-platform.  Developers of network-centric applications thus would not be drawn to Navigator’s APIs in substantial numbers.  Therefore, with the encouragement and support of Gates, a group of Microsoft executives commenced a campaign in the summer of 1995 to convince Netscape to halt its development of platform-level browsing technologies for Windows 95.</span></p><p><span>81.In a meeting held at Microsoft’s headquarters on June 2, 1995, Microsoft executives suggested to Jim Clark’s replacement as CEO at Netscape, James Barksdale, that the version of Navigator written for Windows 95 be designed to rely upon the Internet-related APIs in Windows 95 and distinguish itself with “value-added” software components.  The Microsoft executives left unsaid the fact that value-added software, by definition, does not present a significant platform for applications development.  For his part, Barksdale informed the Microsoft representatives that the browser represented an important part of Netscape’s business strategy and that Windows 3.1 and Windows 95 were expected to be the primary platforms for which Navigator would be distributed.</span></p><p><span>82.At the conclusion of the June 2 meeting, Microsoft still did not know whether or not Netscape intended to preserve Navigator’s own platform capabilities and expand the set of APIs that it exposed to developers.  In the hope that Netscape could still be persuaded to forswear any platform ambitions and instead rely on the Internet technologies in Windows 95, Microsoft accepted Barksdale’s invitation to send a group of representatives to Netscape’s headquarters for a technology “brainstorming session” on June 21.  Netscape’s senior executives saw the meeting as an opportunity to ask Microsoft for access to crucial technical information, including certain APIs, that Netscape needed in order to ensure that Navigator would work well on systems running Windows 95.  </span></p><p><span>83.Early in the June 21 meeting, Microsoft representatives told Barksdale and the other Netscape executives present that they wanted to explore the possibility of building a broader and closer relationship between the two companies.  To this end, the Microsoft representatives wanted to know whether Netscape intended to adopt and build on top of the Internet-related platform that Microsoft planned to include in Windows 95, or rather to expose its own Internet-</span></p><p><span>related APIs, which would compete with Microsoft’s.  If Netscape was not committed to providing an alternative platform for network-centric applications, Microsoft would assist Netscape in developing server- and (to a limited extent) PC-based software applications that relied on Microsoft’s Internet technologies.  For one thing, the representatives explained, Microsoft would be content to leave the development of browser products for the Mac OS, UNIX, and Microsoft’s 16-bit operating system products to Netscape.  Alternatively, Netscape could license to Microsoft the underlying code for a Microsoft-branded browser to run on those platforms.  The Microsoft representatives made it clear, however, that Microsoft would be marketing its own browser for Windows 95, and that this product would rely on Microsoft’s platform-level Internet technologies.  If Netscape marketed browsing software for Windows 95 based on different technologies, then Microsoft would view Netscape as a competitor, not a partner.</span></p><p><span>84.When Barksdale brought the discussion back to the particular Windows 95 APIs that Netscape actually wanted to rely on and needed from Microsoft, the representatives from Microsoft explained that if Netscape entered a “special relationship” with Microsoft, the company would treat Netscape as a “preferred ISV.”  This meant that Netscape would enjoy preferential access to technical information, including APIs.  They intimated that Microsoft’s internal developers had already created the APIs that Netscape was seeking, and that Microsoft had not yet decided either which ISVs would be privileged to receive them or when access would be granted.  The Microsoft representatives made clear that the alacrity with which Netscape would receive the desired Windows 95 APIs and other technical information would depend on whether Netscape entered this “special relationship” with Microsoft.</span></p><p><span>85.After listening to Microsoft’s proposal, Barksdale had two main questions:  First, where would the line between platform (Microsoft’s exclusive domain) and applications (where Netscape could continue to function) be situated?  Second, who would get to decide where the line would lie?  After all, the attractiveness of a special relationship with Microsoft depended a great deal on how much room would remain for Netscape to innovate and seek profit.  The Microsoft representatives replied that Microsoft would incorporate most of the functionality of the current Netscape browser into the Windows 95 platform, perhaps leaving room for Netscape to distribute a user-interface shell.  Where Netscape would have the most scope to innovate would be in the development of software “solutions,” which are applications (mainly server-</span></p><p><span>based) focused on meeting the needs of specific types of commercial users.  Since such applications are already minutely calibrated to the needs of their users, they do not present platforms for the development of more specific applications.  Although the representatives from Microsoft assured Barksdale that the line between platform and solutions was fixed by a collaborative decision-making process between Microsoft and its ISV partners, those representatives had already indicated that the space Netscape would be allowed to occupy between the user and Microsoft’s platform domain was a very narrow one.  Simply put, if Navigator exposed APIs that competed for developer attention with the Internet-related APIs Microsoft was planning to build into its platform, Microsoft would regard Netscape as a trespasser on its territory.</span></p><p><span>86.The Microsoft representatives did not insist at the June 21 meeting that Netscape executives accept their proposal on the spot.  For his part, Barksdale said only that he would like more information regarding where Microsoft proposed to place the line between its platform and Netscape’s applications.  In the ensuing, more technical discussions, the Netscape executives agreed to adopt one component of Microsoft’s platform-level Internet technology called Internet Shortcuts.  The meeting ended cordially, with both sides promising to keep the lines of communication open.</span></p><p><span>87.The executive who led Microsoft’s contingent on June 21, Daniel Rosen, emerged from the meeting optimistic that Netscape would abandon its platform ambitions in exchange for special help from Microsoft in developing solutions.  His sentiments were not shared by another Microsoft participant, Thomas Reardon, who had not failed to notice the Netscape executives grow tense when the Microsoft representatives referred to incorporating Navigator’s functionality into Windows.  Reardon predicted that Netscape would compete with almost all of Microsoft’s platform-level Internet technologies.  Once he heard both viewpoints, Gates concluded that Rosen was being a bit naive and that Reardon had assessed the situation more accurately.  In the middle of July 1995, Rosen’s superiors instructed him to drop the effort to reach a strategic concord with Netscape.</span></p><p><span>88.Had Netscape accepted Microsoft’s proposal, it would have forfeited any prospect of presenting a comprehensive platform for the development of network-centric applications.  Even if the versions of Navigator written for the Mac OS, UNIX, and 16-bit Windows had continued to expose APIs controlled by Netscape, the fact that Netscape would not have marketed any platform software for Windows 95, the operating system that was destined to become dominant, would have ensured that, for the foreseeable future, too few developers would rely on Navigator’s APIs to create a threat to the applications barrier to entry.  In fact, although the discussions ended before Microsoft was compelled to demarcate precisely where the boundary between its platform and Netscape’s applications would lie, it is unclear whether Netscape’s acceptance of Microsoft’s proposal would have left the firm with even the ability to survive as an independent business.</span></p><p><span>89.At the time Microsoft presented its proposal, Navigator was the only browser product with a significant share of the market and thus the only one with the potential to weaken the applications barrier to entry.  Thus, had it convinced Netscape to accept its offer of a “special relationship,” Microsoft quickly would have gained such control over the extensions and standards that network-centric applications (including Web sites) employ as to make it all but impossible for any future browser rival to lure appreciable developer interest away from Microsoft’s platform.</span></p><p><span>B.Withholding Crucial Technical Information</span></p><p><span>90.Microsoft knew that Netscape needed certain critical technical information and assistance in order to complete its Windows 95 version of Navigator in time for the retail release of Windows 95.  Indeed, Netscape executives had made a point of requesting this information, especially the so-called Remote Network Access (“RNA”) API, at the June 21 meeting.  As was discussed above, the Microsoft representatives at the meeting had responded that the haste with which Netscape received the desired technical information would depend on whether Netscape entered the so-called “special relationship” with Microsoft.  Specifically, Microsoft representative J. Allard had told Barksdale that the way in which the two companies concluded the meeting would determine whether Netscape received the RNA API immediately or in three months.</span></p><p><span>91.Although Netscape declined the special relationship with Microsoft, its executives continued, over the weeks following the June 21 meeting, to plead for the RNA API.  Despite Netscape’s persistence, Microsoft did not release the API to Netscape until late October, </span><span>i.e.</span><span>, as Allard had warned, more than three months later.  The delay in turn forced Netscape to postpone the release of its Windows 95 browser until substantially after the release of Windows 95 (and Internet Explorer) in August 1995.  As a result, Netscape was excluded from most of the holiday selling season.</span></p><p><span>92.Microsoft similarly withheld a scripting tool that Netscape needed to make its browser compatible with certain dial-up ISPs.  Microsoft had licensed the tool freely to ISPs that wanted it, and in fact had cooperated with Netscape in drafting a license agreement that, by mid-</span></p><p><span>July 1996, needed only to be signed by an authorized Microsoft executive to go into effect.  There the process halted, however.  In mid-August, a Microsoft representative informed Netscape that senior executives at Microsoft had decided to link the grant of the license to the resolution of all open issues between the companies.  Netscape never received a license to the scripting tool, and as a result, was unable to do business with certain ISPs for a time.</span></p><p><span>C.The Similar Experiences of Other Firms in Dealing with Microsoft</span></p><p><span>93.Other firms in the computer industry have had encounters with Microsoft similar to the experiences of Netscape described above.  These interactions demonstrate that it is Microsoft’s corporate practice to pressure other firms to halt software development that either shows the potential to weaken the applications barrier to entry or competes directly with Microsoft’s most cherished software products.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span/></p><p><span/></p><p><span>1.Intel</span></p><p><span>94.At the same time that Microsoft was trying to convince Netscape to stop developing cross-platform APIs, it was trying to convince Intel to halt the development of software that presented developers with a set of operating-system-independent interfaces.</span></p><p><span>95.Although Intel is engaged principally in the design and manufacture of microprocessors, it also develops some software.  Intel’s software development efforts, which take place at the Intel Architecture Labs (“IAL”), are directed primarily at finding useful ways to consume more microprocessor cycles, thereby stimulating demand for advanced Intel microprocessors.  By early 1995, IAL was in the advanced stages of developing software that would enable Intel 80x86 microprocessors to carry out tasks usually performed by separate chips known as “digital signal processors.”  By enabling this migration, the software, called Native Signal Processing (“NSP”) software, would endow Intel microprocessors with substantially enhanced video and graphics performance.</span></p><p><span>96.Intel was eager for software developers and hardware manufacturers to write software and build peripheral devices that would implement the enhanced capabilities that its microprocessors and its NSP software together offered.  Intel did not believe, however, that the set of APIs and device driver interfaces (“DDIs”) in Windows had kept pace with the growing ability of Intel’s microprocessors to deliver audio/visual content.  Consequently, IAL designed its NSP software to expose Intel’s own APIs and DDIs that, when invoked by developers and hardware manufacturers, would demonstrate the multimedia capabilities of an Intel microprocessor utilizing NSP.</span></p><p><span>97.Microsoft reacted to Intel’s NSP software with alarm.  First of all, the software threatened to offer ISVs and device manufacturers an alternative to waiting for Windows to provide system-level support for products that would take advantage of advances in hardware technology.  More troubling was the fact that Intel was developing versions of its NSP software for non-Microsoft operating systems.  The different versions of the NSP software exposed the same set of software interfaces to developers, so the more an application took advantage of interfaces exposed by NSP software, the easier it would be to port that application to non-</span></p><p><span>Microsoft operating systems.  In short, Intel’s NSP software bore the potential to weaken the barrier protecting Microsoft’s monopoly power.</span></p><p><span>98.Over time, Microsoft developed additional qualms about Intel’s NSP software.  For instance, Intel initially designed the NSP software to be compatible with only Windows 3.1.  At the time, Microsoft was preparing to release Windows 95, and the company did not want anything rekindling the interest of ISVs, equipment manufacturers, and consumers in the soon-to-</span></p><p><span>be obsolescent version of Windows.  More acute was Microsoft’s concern that users who received NSP software on their Windows 3.1 systems would have difficulty upgrading those systems to Windows 95.  By June 1995, Intel had completed a pre-release, or “beta,” version of its NSP software for Windows 95, but Microsoft worried that a commercial version would not be ready by the time OEMs began loading Windows 95.  </span></p><p><span>99.Along with its concerns about contemporaneous compatibility, Microsoft also complained that Intel had not subjected its software to sufficient quality-assurance testing.  Microsoft was quick to point out that if Windows users detected problems with the software that came pre-installed on their PC systems, they would blame Microsoft or the OEMs, even if fault lay with Intel.  Microsoft’s concerns with compatibility and quality were genuine.  Both pre-</span></p><p><span>dating and over-shadowing these transient and remediable concerns, however, was a more abiding fear at Microsoft that the NSP software would render ISVs, device manufacturers, and (ultimately) consumers less dependent on Windows.  Without this fear, Microsoft would not have subjected Intel to the level of pressure that it brought to bear in the summer of 1995.</span></p><p><span>100.Microsoft began complaining to Intel about its NSP software in inter-company communications sent in the spring of 1995.  In May, Microsoft raised the profile of its complaints by sending some of its senior executives to Intel to discuss the latter’s incursion into Microsoft’s platform territory.  Returning from the May meeting, one Microsoft employee urged his superiors to refuse to allow Intel to offer platform-level software, even if it meant that Intel could not innovate as quickly as it would like.  If Intel wished to enable a new function, the employee wrote, its only “winning path” would be to convince Microsoft to support the effort in its platform software.  At any rate, “[s]ometimes Intel would have to accept the outcome that the time isn’t right for [Microsoft].”  In the first week of July, Gates himself met with Intel’s CEO, Andrew Grove, to discuss, among other things, NSP.  In a subsequent memorandum to senior Microsoft executives, Gates reported that he had tried to convince Grove “to basically not ship NSP” and more generally to reduce the number of people working on software at Intel.</span></p><p><span>101.The development of an alternative platform to challenge Windows was not the primary objective of Intel’s NSP efforts.  In fact, Intel was interested in providing APIs and DDIs only to the extent the effort was necessary to ensure the development of applications and devices that would spark demand for Intel’s most advanced microprocessors.  Understanding Intel’s limited ambitions, Microsoft hastened to assure Intel that if it would stop promoting NSP’s interfaces, Microsoft would accelerate its own work to incorporate the functions of the NSP software into Windows, thereby stimulating the development of applications and devices that relied on the new capabilities of Intel’s microprocessors.  At the same time, Microsoft pressured the major OEMs to not install NSP software on their PCs until the software ceased to expose APIs.  NSP software could not find its way onto PCs without the cooperation of the OEMs, so Intel realized that it had no choice but to surrender the pace of software innovation to Microsoft.  By the end of July 1995, Intel had agreed to stop promoting its NSP software.  Microsoft subsequently incorporated some of NSP’s components into its operating-system products.  Even as late as the end of 1998, though, Microsoft still had not implemented key capabilities that Intel had been poised to offer consumers in 1995.</span></p><p><span>102.Microsoft was not content to merely quash Intel’s NSP software.  At a second meeting at Intel’s headquarters on August 2, 1995, Gates told Grove that he had a fundamental problem with Intel using revenues from its microprocessor business to fund the development and distribution of free platform-level software.  In fact, Gates said, Intel could not count on Microsoft to support Intel’s next generation of microprocessors as long as Intel was developing platform-level software that competed with Windows.  Intel’s senior executives knew full well that Intel would have difficultly selling PC microprocessors if Microsoft stopped cooperating in making them compatible with Windows and if Microsoft stated to OEMs that it did not support Intel’s chips.  Faced with Gates’ threat, Intel agreed to stop developing platform-level interfaces that might draw support away from interfaces exposed by Windows.</span></p><p><span>103.OEMs represent the primary customers for Intel’s microprocessors.  Since OEMs are dependent on Microsoft for Windows, Microsoft enjoys continuing leverage over Intel.  To illustrate, Gates was able to report to other senior Microsoft executives in October 1995 that “Intel feels we have all the OEMs on hold with our NSP chill.”  He added: </span></p><p><span>This is good news because it means OEMs are listening to us.  Andy [Grove] believes Intel is living up to its part of the NSP bargain and that we should let OEMs know that some of the new software work Intel is doing is OK.  If Intel is not sticking totally to its part of the deal let me know.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>2.Apple</span></p><p><span>104.QuickTime is Apple’s software architecture for creating, editing, publishing, and playing back multimedia content (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, audio, video, graphics, and 3-D graphics).  Apple has created versions of QuickTime to run on both the Mac OS and Windows, enabling developers using the authoring software to create multimedia content that will run on QuickTime implementations for both operating systems.  QuickTime competes with Microsoft’s own multimedia technologies, including Microsoft’s multimedia APIs (called “DirectX”) and its media player.  Because QuickTime is cross-platform middleware, Microsoft perceives it as a potential threat to the applications barrier to entry.</span></p><p><span>105.Beginning in the spring of 1997 and continuing into the summer of 1998, Microsoft tried to persuade Apple to stop producing a Windows 95 version of its multimedia playback software, which presented developers of multimedia content with alternatives to Microsoft’s multimedia APIs.  If Apple acceded to the proposal, Microsoft executives said, Microsoft would not enter the authoring business and would instead assist Apple in developing and selling tools for developers writing multimedia content.  Just as Netscape would have been free, had it accepted Microsoft’s proposal, to market a browser shell that would run on top of Microsoft’s Internet technologies, Apple would have been permitted, without hindrance, to market a media player that would run on top of DirectX.  But, like the browser shell that Microsoft contemplated as acceptable for Netscape to develop, Apple’s QuickTime shell would not have exposed platform-level APIs to developers.  Microsoft executives acknowledged to Apple their doubts that a firm could make a successful business out of marketing such a shell.  Apple might find it profitable, though, to continue developing multimedia software for the Mac OS, and that, the executives from Microsoft assured Apple, would not be objectionable.  As was the case with the Internet technologies it was prepared to tolerate from Netscape, Microsoft felt secure in the conviction that developers would not be drawn in large numbers to write for non-</span></p><p><span>Microsoft APIs exposed by platforms whose installed bases were inconsequential in comparison with that of Windows.  </span></p><p><span>106.In their discussions with Apple, Microsoft’s representatives made it clear that, if Apple continued to market multimedia playback software for Windows 95 that presented a platform for content development, then Microsoft would enter the authoring business to ensure that those writing multimedia content for Windows 95 concentrated on Microsoft’s APIs instead of Apple’s.  The Microsoft representatives further stated that, if Microsoft was compelled to develop and market authoring tools in competition with Apple, the technologies provided in those tools might very well be inconsistent with those provided by Apple’s tools.  Finally, the Microsoft executives warned, Microsoft would invest whatever resources were necessary to ensure that developers used its tools; its investment would not be constrained by the fact that authoring software generated only modest revenue.  </span></p><p><span>107.If Microsoft implemented technologies in its tools that were different from those implemented in Apple’s tools, then multimedia content developed with Microsoft’s tools would not run properly on Apple’s media player, and content developed with Apple’s tools would not run properly on Microsoft’s media player.  If, as it implied it was willing to do, Microsoft then bundled its media player with Windows and used a variety of tactics to limit the distribution of Apple’s media player for Windows, it could succeed in extinguishing developer support for Apple’s multimedia technologies.  Indeed, as the Court discusses in Section VI of these findings, Microsoft had begun, in 1996, to use just such a strategy against Sun’s implementation of the Java technologies.</span></p><p><span>108.The discussions over multimedia playback software culminated in a meeting between executives from Microsoft and Apple executives, including Apple CEO, Steve Jobs, at Apple’s headquarters on June 15, 1998.  Microsoft’s objective at the meeting was to secure Apple’s commitment to abandon the development of multimedia playback software for Windows.  At the meeting, one of the Microsoft executives, Eric Engstrom, said that he hoped the two companies could agree on a single configuration of software to play multimedia content on Windows.  He added, significantly, that any unified multimedia playback software for Windows would have to be based on DirectX.  If Apple would agree to make DirectX the standard, Microsoft would be willing to do several things that Apple might find beneficial.  First, Microsoft would adopt Apple’s “.MOV” as the universal file format for multimedia playback on Windows.  Second, Microsoft would configure the Windows Media Player to display the QuickTime logo during the playback of “.MOV” files.  Third, Microsoft would include support in DirectX for QuickTime APIs used to author multimedia content, and Microsoft would give Apple appropriate credit for the APIs in Microsoft’s Software Developer Kit.</span></p><p><span>109.Jobs reserved comment during the meeting with the Microsoft representatives, but he explicitly rejected Microsoft’s proposal a few weeks later.  Had Apple accepted Microsoft’s proposal, Microsoft would have succeeded in limiting substantially the cross-platform development of multimedia content.  In addition, Apple’s future success in marketing authoring tools for Windows 95 would have become dependent on Microsoft’s ongoing cooperation, for those tools would have relied on the DirectX technologies under Microsoft’s control.</span></p><p><span>110.Apple’s surrender of the multimedia playback business might have helped users in the short term by resolving existing incompatibilities in the arena of multimedia software.  In the long run, however, the departure of an experienced, innovative competitor would not have tended to benefit users of multimedia content.  At any rate, the primary motivation behind Microsoft’s proposal to Apple was not the resolution of incompatibilities that frustrated consumers and stymied content development.  Rather, Microsoft’s motivation was its desire to limit as much as possible the development of multimedia content that would run cross-platform.</span></p><p><span>3.RealNetworks</span></p><p><span>111.RealNetworks is the leader, in terms of usage share, in software that supports the “streaming” of audio and video content from the Web.  RealNetworks’ streaming software presents a set of APIs that competes for developer attention with APIs exposed by the streaming technologies in Microsoft’s DirectX.  Like Apple, RealNetworks has developed versions of its software for multiple operating systems.  In 1997, senior Microsoft executives viewed RealNetworks’ streaming software with the same apprehension with which they viewed Apple’s playback software — as competitive technology that could develop into part of a middleware layer that could, in turn, become broad and widespread enough to weaken the applications barrier to entry.</span></p><p><span>112.At the end of May 1997, Gates told a group of Microsoft executives that multimedia streaming represented strategic ground that Microsoft needed to capture.  He identified RealNetworks as the adversary and authorized the payment of up to $65 million for a streaming software company in order to accelerate Microsoft’s effort to seize control of streaming standards.  Two weeks later, Microsoft signed a letter of intent for the acquisition of a streaming media company called VXtreme.</span></p><p><span>113.Perhaps sensing an impending crisis, executives at RealNetworks contacted Microsoft within days of the VXtreme deal’s announcement and proposed that the two companies enter a strategic relationship.  The CEO of RealNetworks told a senior vice president at Microsoft that if RealNetworks were presented with a profitable opportunity to move to value-added software, the company would be amenable to abandoning the base streaming business.  On July 10, a Microsoft executive, Robert Muglia, told a RealNetworks executive that it would indeed be in the interests of both companies if RealNetworks limited itself to developing value-added software designed to run on top of Microsoft’s fundamental multimedia platform.  Consequently, on July 18, Microsoft and RealNetworks entered into an agreement whereby Microsoft agreed to distribute a copy of RealNetworks’ media player with each copy of Internet Explorer; to make a substantial investment in RealNetworks; to license the source code for certain RealNetworks streaming technologies; and to develop, along with RealNetworks, a common file format for streaming audio and video content.  Muglia, who signed the agreement on Microsoft’s behalf, believed that RealNetworks had in turn agreed to incorporate Microsoft’s streaming media technologies into its products.  </span></p><p><span>114.RealNetworks apparently understood import of the agreement differently, for just a few days after it signed the deal with Microsoft, RealNetworks announced that it planned to continue developing fundamental streaming software.  Indeed, RealNetworks continues to do so today.  Thus, the mid-summer negotiations did not lead to the result Microsoft had intended.  Still, Microsoft’s intentions toward RealNetworks in 1997, and its dealings with the company that summer, show that decision-makers at Microsoft were willing to invest a large amount of cash and other resources into securing the agreement of other companies to halt software development that exhibited discernible potential to weaken the applications barrier.</span></p><p><span>4.IBM</span></p><p><span>115.</span><span>IBM is both a hardware and a software company.  On the hardware side, IBM manufactures and licenses, among other things, Intel-compatible PCs.  On the software side, IBM develops and sells, among other things, Intel-compatible PC operating systems and office productivity applications.  The IBM PC Company relies heavily on Microsoft’s cooperation to make a profit, for few consumers would buy IBM PC systems if those systems did not work well with Windows and, further, if they did not come with Windows included.</span><span/><span>IBM’s software division, on the other hand, competes directly with Microsoft in other respects.  For instance, IBM has in the past marketed OS/2 as an alternative to Windows, and it currently markets the SmartSuite bundle of office productivity applications as an alternative to Microsoft’s Office suite.  The fact that IBM’s software division markets products that compete directly with Microsoft’s most profitable products has frustrated the efforts of the IBM PC Company to maintain a cooperative relationship with the firm that controls the product (Windows) without which the PC Company cannot survive.</span></p><p><span>116.Whereas Microsoft tried to convince Netscape to move its business in a direction that would not facilitate the emergence of products that would compete with Windows, Microsoft tried to convince IBM to move its business away from products that themselves competed directly with Windows and Office.  Microsoft leveraged the fact that the PC Company needed to license Windows at a competitive price and on a timely basis, and the fact that the company needed Microsoft’s support in many more subtle ways.  When IBM refused to abate the promotion of those of its own products that competed with Windows and Office, Microsoft punished the IBM PC Company with higher prices, a late license for Windows 95, and the withholding of technical and marketing support.</span></p><p><span>117.In the summer of 1994, the IBM PC Company told Microsoft that, with respect to licensing Microsoft’s operating-system products, it wanted to be quoted terms just as favorable as those extended to IBM’s competitor, Compaq.  It was IBM’s belief that Compaq paid the lowest rate in the industry for Windows and enjoyed unparalleled marketing and technical support from Microsoft.  In response to the IBM PC Company’s request, Microsoft proposed that the companies enter into a “Frontline Partnership” similar to the one that existed between Microsoft and Compaq.  Pursuant to that proposal, Microsoft and the IBM PC Company would perform joint sales, marketing, and development work, and the PC Company would receive future Microsoft products at the lowest rates in the industry.  </span></p><p><span>118.At the same time that it offered the IBM PC Company the rather general terms in the Frontline Partnership Agreement, Microsoft also offered the PC Company specific reductions in the royalty rate for Windows 95 if the company would focus its marketing and distribution efforts on Microsoft’s new operating system.  Specifically, the PC Company would receive an $8 reduction in the per-copy royalty for Windows 95 if it mentioned no other operating systems in advertisements for IBM PCs, adopted Windows 95 as the standard operating system for its employees, and ensured that it was shipping Windows 95 pre-installed on at least fifty percent of its PCs two months after the release of Windows 95.  Given the volume of IBM’s PC shipments, the discount would have amounted to savings of between $40 million and $48 million in one year.  Of course, accepting the terms would have required IBM, as a practical matter, to abandon its own operating system, OS/2.  After all, IBM would have had difficulty convincing customers to adopt its own OS/2 if the company itself had used Microsoft’s Windows 95 and had featured that product to the exclusion of OS/2 in IBM PC advertisements.</span></p><p><span>119.Representatives from IBM and Microsoft, including Bill Gates, met to discuss the relationship between their companies at an industry conference in November 1994.  At that meeting, IBM informed Microsoft that, rather than enter into the Frontline Partnership with Microsoft, IBM was going to pursue an initiative it called “IBM First.”  Consistent with the title of the initiative, IBM would aggressively promote IBM’s software products, would not promote any Microsoft products, and would pre-install OS/2 Warp on all of its PCs, including those on which it would also pre-install Windows.  IBM thus rejected the terms that would have resulted in an $8 reduction in the per-copy royalty price of Windows 95.</span></p><p><span>120.True to its word, IBM began vigorous promotion of its software products.  This effort included an advertising campaign, starting in late 1994, that extolled OS/2 Warp and disparaged Windows.  IBM’s drive to best Microsoft in the PC software venue intensified in June 1995, when IBM reached an agreement with the Lotus Development Corporation for the acquisition of that company.  As a consequence of the acquisition, IBM took ownership of the Lotus groupware product, Lotus Notes, and the Lotus SmartSuite bundle of office productivity applications.  Microsoft had already identified Notes as a middleware threat, because it presented users with a common interface, and ISVs with a common set of APIs, across multiple platforms.  For its part, SmartSuite competed directly with Microsoft Office.  In mid-July 1995, IBM announced that it was going to make SmartSuite its primary desktop software offering in the United States.</span></p><p><span>121.Microsoft did not intend to capitulate.  In July, Gates called an executive at the IBM PC Company to berate him about IBM’s public statements denigrating Windows.  Just a few days later, Microsoft began to retaliate in earnest against the IBM PC Company.</span></p><p><span>122.The IBM PC Company had begun negotiations with Microsoft for a Windows 95 license in late March 1995.  For the first two months, the negotiations had progressed smoothly and at an expected pace.  After IBM announced its intention to acquire Lotus, though, the Microsoft negotiators began canceling meetings with their IBM counterparts, failing to return telephone calls, and delaying the return of marked-up license drafts that they received from IBM.  Then, on July 20, 1995, just three days after IBM announced its intention to pre-install SmartSuite on its PCs, a Microsoft executive informed his counterpart at the IBM PC Company that Microsoft was terminating further negotiations with IBM for a license to Windows 95.  Microsoft also refused to release to the PC Company the Windows 95 “golden master” code.   The PC Company needed the code for its product planning and development, and IBM executives knew that Microsoft had released it to IBM’s OEM competitors on July 17.  Microsoft’s purported reason for halting the negotiations was that it wanted first to resolve an ongoing audit of IBM’s past royalty payments to Microsoft for several different operating systems.</span></p><p><span>123.Prior to the call on July 20, neither company’s management had ever linked the ongoing audit to IBM’s negotiations for a license to Windows 95.  IBM was dismayed by the abrupt halt in the license negotiations and the prospect that it might not get a license for Windows 95 until the audit process concluded.  IBM’s executives executives surmised that all of its major competitors had already signed licenses for Windows 95.  The PC Company would lose a great deal of business to those competitors during the crucial back-to-school season if it could not begin pre-installing Windows 95 on its PCs immediately.  The conclusion of the audit appeared to be weeks, if not months, away.  The PC Company thus faced the prospect of missing the holiday selling season as well.  IBM executives pleaded with Microsoft to uncouple the license negotiations from the ongoing audit and offered Microsoft a $10 million bond that Microsoft could use to indemnify itself against  any discrepancies that the audit might ultimately reveal.  IBM also offered to add a term to any Windows 95 license agreement whereby IBM would pay penalties and interest if any future audit disclosed under-reporting of royalties by IBM.</span></p><p><span>124.On August 9, 1995, a senior executive at the IBM PC Company went to Redmond to meet with Joachim Kempin, the Microsoft executive in charge of the firm’s sales to OEMs.  At the meeting, Kempin offered to accept a single, lump-sum payment from IBM that would close all outstanding audits.  The amount of this payment would be reduced if IBM offered a concession that Kempin could take back to Gates.  As one possibility, Kempin suggested that IBM agree to not bundle SmartSuite with its PCs for a period of six months to one year.  He explained that the prospect of IBM bundling SmartSuite with its PCs threatened the profit margins that Microsoft derived from Office and constituted a core issue in the relationship between the two companies.  The IBM executive rejected Kempin’s suggestion.  In a follow-up letter, Kempin stated that Microsoft would require approximately $25 million from IBM in order to settle all outstanding audits.  Kempin reiterated that, </span></p><p><span>If you believe that the amount I am asking for is too much, I would be willing to trade certain relationship improving measures for the settlement charges and/or convert some of the amounts into marketing funds if IBM too agrees to promote Microsoft’s software products together with their hardware offerings.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>The message was clear:  IBM could resolve the impasse ostensibly blocking the issuance of a Windows 95 license — the royalties audit — by de-emphasizing those products of its own that competed with Microsoft and instead promoting Microsoft’s products.</span></p><p><span>125.IBM never agreed to renounce SmartSuite or to increase its support for Microsoft software, and in the end, Microsoft did not grant IBM a license to pre-install Windows 95 until fifteen minutes before the start of Microsoft’s official launch event on August 24, 1995.  That same day, the firms brought the audit issue to a close with a settlement agreement under which IBM ultimately paid Microsoft $31 million.  The release of Windows 95 had been postponed more than once, and many consumers apparently had been postponing buying PC systems until the new operating system arrived.  The pent-up demand caused an initial surge in the sales of PCs loaded with Windows 95.  IBM’s OEM competitors reaped the fruits of this surge, but because of the delay in obtaining a license, the IBM PC Company did not.  The PC Company also missed the back-to-school market.  These lost opportunities cost IBM substantial revenue.</span></p><p><span>126.Even once the companies had resolved the audit dispute, Microsoft continued to treat the IBM PC Company less favorably than it did the other major OEMs, and Microsoft executives continued to tell PC Company executives that the treatment would improve only if IBM refrained from competing with Microsoft’s software offerings.  On January 5, 1996, Kempin sent a letter to a counterpart at the IBM PC Company.  In it, Kempin expressed his belief that the PC Company would enjoy a closer, more cooperative relationship with Microsoft if only IBM’s software arm did not compete as aggressively with the products that comprised the core of Microsoft’s business:</span></p><p><span>As long as IBM is working first on their competitive offerings and prefers to fiercely compete with us in critical areas, we should just be honest with each other and admit that such priorities will not lead to a most exciting relationship and might not even make IBM feel good when selling solutions based on Microsoft products. . . .You are a valued OEM customer of Microsoft, with whom we will cooperate as much as your self-imposed restraints allow us to do.  Please understand that this is neither my choice or preferred way of doing business with an important company like IBM.  In addition, we would like to see the IBM PC company being more actively involved in assisting Microsoft to bring key products to market . . . . To date the IBM PC company has not always been an active participant in these areas - understandable given your own internal product priorities.  I hope you can help me to change this.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>In closing, Kempin wrote, “You get measured in selling more hardware and I firmly believe if you had less conflict with IBM’s software directions you actually could sell more of it.”  </span></p><p><span>127.When Kempin spoke to the same executive at the end of the month, he repeated a message he had delivered more than once before:  The fact that the IBM PC Company pre-</span></p><p><span>installed SmartSuite on its PC systems made Microsoft reluctant to help IBM sell more PC systems.  After all, the more PC systems IBM sold with SmartSuite, the fewer copies of Office Microsoft could sell.  For this reason, as Kempin explained to a group of IBM PC Company representatives in August 1996, Microsoft refused to provide IBM press releases with quotes endorsing any PC system that IBM shipped with SmartSuite.  Microsoft later expanded that rule to cover any IBM PCs shipped with the World Book electronic encyclopedia instead of Microsoft’s Encarta.  IBM might have been less concerned about Microsoft’s refusal to offer endorsements if such quotes did not appear frequently and prominently in press releases announcing new PC systems from other OEMs such as Compaq.  Microsoft’s conspicuous silence with respect to IBM PCs sent the message to customers that IBM’s PCs did not support Windows as well as PCs manufactured by other OEMs did.</span></p><p><span>128.Microsoft also denied the IBM PC Company access to the so-called “enabling programs” that Microsoft ran for the benefit of OEMs such as Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, and DEC, even though IBM met the prescribed objective criteria for admission.  Like the absence of public endorsements, IBM’s exclusion from Microsoft’s enabling programs led customers to question whether the Microsoft software they needed would work optimally with IBM’s PCs.  IBM learned through surveys it conducted that the firm had lost between seven and ten large accounts, representing about $180 million in revenue for IBM, because the tension between Microsoft and IBM led customers to doubt that Windows would not work as well with IBM PCs as with PCs produced by firms with which Microsoft was on cordial terms.  Microsoft justified its exclusion of the PC Company from the enabling programs with its suspicion that IBM might use the programs to gain </span><span>entrée</span><span> with customers and then attempt to sell those customers IBM software instead of Microsoft products.  At the same time, a Microsoft executive told a counterpart at IBM that the PC Company would be admitted to the programs when IBM’s CEO repaired his relationship with Bill Gates.</span></p><p><span>129.Microsoft’s executives were persistent despite IBM’s repeated refusals to sacrifice its own software ambitions to improve its relations with Microsoft.  In February 1997, one executive from Microsoft told a group of IBM PC Company executives that Gates might relent in his reluctance to cooperate with their company if IBM moderated its support for Notes and SmartSuite.  In a meeting held the next month, Microsoft representatives conditioned fulfillment of two objects of IBM’s desires on the company’s willingness to pre-install Microsoft’s products in the place of competing applications, such as SmartSuite, and objectionable middleware, such as Notes.  The first inducement that the Microsoft representatives blandished before the PC Company was early access to Windows source code, which Compaq and a handful of other OEMs enjoyed.  IBM wanted this early access in order to ensure its hardware’s contemporaneous compatibility with Microsoft’s operating system products.  Next, Microsoft offered IBM permission to certify itself as being compliant with certain hardware requirements that Microsoft imposed (and that customers had come to look for as a sign of an OEM’s ability to support Windows).  Self-certification would have decreased the time it took IBM PCs to reach the market, and IBM knew that the privilege was already being extended to some of its main OEM competitors.  With respect to both benefits, the representatives from Microsoft explained that Microsoft would extend them to the PC Company on the condition that it stop loading its PC systems with software that threatened Microsoft’s interests.</span></p><p><span>130.The discriminatory treatment that the IBM PC Company received from Microsoft on account of the “software directions” of its parent company also manifested itself in the royalty price that IBM paid for Windows.  In the latter half of the 1990s, IBM (along with Gateway) paid significantly more for Windows than other major OEMs (like Compaq, Dell, and Hewlett-</span></p><p><span>Packard) that were more compliant with Microsoft’s wishes.</span></p><p><span>131.Finally, Microsoft made its frustration known to IBM by reducing, from three to one, the number of Microsoft OEM account managers handling Microsoft’s operational relationship with the IBM PC Company.  This reduced support impaired still further IBM’s ability to test, manufacture, and ship its PCs on schedule, further delaying IBM’s efforts to bring its PC products to market against the competition in a timely manner.</span></p><p><span>132.In sum, from 1994 to 1997 Microsoft consistently pressured IBM to reduce its support for software products that competed with Microsoft’s offerings, and it used its monopoly power in the market for Intel-compatible PC operating systems to punish IBM for its refusal to cooperate.  Whereas, in the case of Netscape, Microsoft tried to induce a company to move its business away from offering software that could weaken the applications barrier to entry, Microsoft’s primary concern with IBM was to reduce the firm’s support for software products that competed directly with Microsoft’s most profitable products, namely Windows and Office.  That being said, it must be noted that one of the IBM products to which Microsoft objected, Notes, was like Navigator in that it exposed middleware APIs.  In any event, Microsoft’s interactions with Netscape, IBM, Intel, Apple, and RealNetworks all reveal Microsoft’s business strategy of directing its monopoly power toward inducing other companies to abandon projects that threaten Microsoft and toward punishing those companies that resist.</span></p><p><span>D.Developing Competitive Web Browsing Software</span></p><p><span>133.Once it became clear to senior executives at Microsoft that Netscape would not abandon its efforts to develop Navigator into a platform, Microsoft focused its efforts on ensuring that few developers would write their applications to rely on the APIs that Navigator exposed.  Developers would only write to the APIs exposed by Navigator in numbers large enough to threaten the applications barrier if they believed that Navigator would emerge as the standard software employed to browse the Web.  If Microsoft could demonstrate that Navigator would not become the standard, because Microsoft’s own browser would attract just as much if not more usage, then developers would continue to focus their efforts on a platform that enjoyed enduring ubiquity: the 32-bit Windows API set.  Microsoft thus set out to maximize Internet Explorer’s share of browser usage at Navigator’s expense.</span></p><p><span>134.Microsoft’s management believed that, no matter what the firm did, Internet Explorer would not capture a large share of browser usage as long as it remained markedly inferior to Navigator in the estimation of consumers.  The task of technical personnel at Microsoft, then, was to make Internet Explorer’s features at least as attractive to consumers as Navigator’s.  Microsoft did not believe that improved quality alone would depose Navigator, for millions of users appeared to be satisfied with Netscape’s product, and Netscape was known as ‘the Internet company.’  As Gates wrote to Microsoft’s executive staff in his May 1995 “Internet Tidal Wave” memorandum, “First we need to offer a decent client,” but “this alone won’t get people to switch away from Netscape.”  Still, once Microsoft ensured that the average consumer would be just as comfortable browsing with Internet Explorer as with Navigator, Microsoft could employ other devices to induce consumers to use its browser instead of Netscape’s.</span></p><p><span>135.From 1995 onward, Microsoft spent more than $100 million each year developing Internet Explorer.  The firm’s management gradually increased the number of developers working on Internet Explorer from five or six in early 1995 to more than one thousand in 1999.  Although the first version of Internet Explorer was demonstrably inferior to Netscape’s then-current browser product when the former was released in July 1995, Microsoft’s investment eventually started to pay technological dividends.  When Microsoft released Internet Explorer 3.0 in late 1996, reviewers praised its vastly improved quality, and some even rated it as favorably as they did Navigator.  After the arrival of Internet Explorer 4.0 in late 1997, the number of reviewers who regarded it as the superior product was roughly equal to those who preferred Navigator.</span></p><p><span>E.Giving Internet Explorer Away and Rewarding Firms that Helped Build Its Usage Share</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>136.In addition to improving the quality of Internet Explorer, Microsoft sought to increase the product’s share of browser usage by giving it away for free.  In many cases, Microsoft also gave other firms things of value (at substantial cost to Microsoft) in exchange for their commitment to distribute and promote Internet Explorer, sometimes explicitly at Navigator’s expense.  While Microsoft might have bundled Internet Explorer with Windows at no additional charge even absent its determination to preserve the applications barrier to entry, that determination was the main force driving its decision to price the product at zero.  Furthermore, Microsoft would not have given Internet Explorer away to IAPs, ISVs, and Apple, nor would it have taken on the high cost of enlisting firms in its campaign to maximize Internet Explorer’s usage share and limit Navigator’s, had it not been focused on protecting the applications barrier.</span></p><p><span>137.In early 1995, personnel developing Internet Explorer at Microsoft contemplated charging OEMs and others for the product when it was released.  Internet Explorer would have been included in a bundle of software that would have been sold as an add-on, or “frosting,” to Windows 95.  Indeed, Microsoft knew by the middle of 1995, if not earlier, that Netscape charged customers to license Navigator, and that Netscape derived a significant portion of its revenue from selling browser licenses.  Despite the opportunity to make a substantial amount of revenue from the sale of Internet Explorer, and with the knowledge that the dominant browser product on the market, Navigator, was being licensed at a price, senior executives at Microsoft decided that Microsoft needed to give its browser away in furtherance of the larger strategic goal of accelerating Internet Explorer’s acquisition of browser usage share.  Consequently, Microsoft decided not to charge an increment in price when it included Internet Explorer in Windows for the first time, and it has continued this policy ever since.  In addition, Microsoft has never charged for an Internet Explorer license when it is distributed separately from Windows.</span></p><p><span>138.Over the months and years that followed the release of Internet Explorer 1.0 in July 1995, senior executives at Microsoft remained engrossed with maximizing Internet Explorer’s share of browser usage.  Whenever competing priorities threatened to intervene, decision-makers at Microsoft reminded those reporting to them that browser usage share remained, as Microsoft senior vice president Paul Maritz put it, “job #1.”  For example, in the summer of 1997, some mid-level employees began to urge that Microsoft charge a price for at least some of the components of Internet Explorer 4.0.  This would have shifted some anticipatory demand to Windows 98 (which was due to be released somewhat later than Internet Explorer 4.0), since Windows 98 would include all of the browser at no extra charge.  Senior executives at Microsoft rejected the proposal, because while the move might have increased demand for Windows 98 and generated substantial revenue, it would have done so at the unacceptable cost of retarding the dissemination of Internet Explorer 4.0.  Maritz reminded those who had advocated the proposal that “getting browser share up to 50% (or more) is still the major goal.”</span></p><p><span>139.The transcendent importance of browser usage share to Microsoft is evident in what the firm expended, as well as in what it relinquished, in order to maximize usage share for Internet Explorer and to diminish it for Navigator.  Not only was Microsoft willing to forego an opportunity to attract substantial revenue while enhancing (albeit temporarily) consumer demand for Windows 98, but the company also paid huge sums of money, and sacrificed many millions more in lost revenue every year, in order to induce firms to take actions that would help increase Internet Explorer’s share of browser usage at Navigator’s expense.  First, even though Microsoft could have charged IAPs, ISVs, and Apple for licenses to distribute Internet Explorer separately from Windows, Microsoft priced those licenses, along with related technology and technical support, at zero in order to induce those companies to distribute and promote Internet Explorer over Navigator.  Second, although Microsoft could have charged IAPs and ICPs substantial sums of money in exchange for promoting their services and content within Windows, Microsoft instead bartered Windows’ valuable desktop “real estate” for a commitment from those firms to promote and distribute Internet Explorer, to inhibit promotion and distribution of Navigator, and to employ technologies that would inspire developers to write Web sites that relied on Microsoft’s Internet technologies rather than those provided by Navigator.  Microsoft was willing to offer such prominent placement even to AOL, which was the principal competitor to Microsoft’s MSN service.  If an IAP was already under contract to pay Netscape a certain amount for browser licenses, Microsoft offered to compensate the IAP the amount it owed Netscape.  Third, Microsoft also reduced the referral fees that IAPs paid when users signed up for their services using the Internet Referral Server in Windows in exchange for the IAPs’ efforts to convert their installed bases of subscribers from Navigator to Internet Explorer.  For example, Microsoft entered a contract with AOL whereby Microsoft actually paid AOL a bounty for every subscriber that it converted to access software that included Internet Explorer instead of Navigator.  Finally, with respect to OEMs, Microsoft extended co-marketing funds and reductions in the Windows royalty price to those agreeing to promote Internet Explorer and, in some cases, to abstain from promoting Navigator.</span></p><p><span>140.Even absent the strategic imperative to maximize its browser usage share at Netscape’s expense, Microsoft might still have set the price of an Internet Explorer consumer license at zero.  It might also have spent something approaching the $100 million it has devoted each year to developing Internet Explorer and some part of the $30 million it has spent annually marketing it.  After all, consumers in 1995 were already demanding software that enabled them to use the Web with ease, and IBM had announced in September 1994 its plan to include browsing capability in OS/2 Warp at no extra charge.  Microsoft had reason to believe that other operating-</span></p><p><span>system vendors would do the same.</span></p><p><span>141.Still, had Microsoft not viewed browser usage share as the key to preserving the applications barrier to entry, the company would not have taken its efforts beyond developing a competitive browser product, including it with Windows at no additional cost to consumers, and promoting it with advertising.  Microsoft would not have absorbed the considerable additional costs associated with enlisting other firms in its campaign to increase Internet Explorer’s usage share at Navigator’s expense.  This investment was only profitable to the extent that it protected the applications barrier to entry.  Neither the desire to bolster demand for Windows, nor the prospect of ancillary revenues, explains the lengths to which Microsoft has gone.  For one thing, loading Navigator makes Windows just as Internet-ready as including Internet Explorer does.  Therefore, Microsoft’s costly efforts to limit the use of Navigator on Windows could not have stemmed from a desire to bolster consumer demand for Windows.  Furthermore, there is no conceivable way that Microsoft’s costly efforts to induce Apple to pre-install Internet Explorer on Apple’s own PC systems could have increased consumer demand for Windows.</span></p><p><span>142.In pursuing its goal of maximizing Internet Explorer’s usage share, Microsoft actually has limited rather severely the number of profit centers from which it could otherwise derive income </span><span>via</span><span> Internet Explorer.  For example, Microsoft allows the developers of browser shells built on Internet Explorer to collect ancillary revenues such as advertising fees; for another, Microsoft permits its browser licensees to change the browser’s start page, thus limiting the fees that advertisers are willing to pay for placement on that page by Microsoft.  Even if Microsoft maximized its ancillary revenue, the amount of revenue realized would not come close to recouping the cost of its campaign to maximize Internet Explorer’s usage share at Navigator’s expense.  The countless communications that Microsoft’s executives dispatched to each other about the company’s need to capture browser usage share indicate that the purpose of the effort had little to do with attracting ancillary revenues and everything to do with protecting the applications barrier from the threat posed by Netscape’s Navigator and Sun’s implementation of Java.  For example, Microsoft vice president Brad Chase told the company’s assembled sales and marketing executives in April 1996 that they should “worry about your browser share[] as much as BillG” even though Internet Explorer was “a no revenue product,” because “we will lose [</span><span>sic</span><span>] the Internet platform battle if we do not have a significant user installed base.”  He told them that “if you let your customers deploy Netscape Navigator, you will loose [</span><span>sic</span><span>] leadership on the desktop.”</span></p><p><span>F.Excluding Navigator from Important Distribution Channels</span></p><p><span>143.Decision-makers at Microsoft worried that simply developing its own attractive browser product, pricing it at zero, and promoting it vigorously would not divert enough browser usage from Navigator to neutralize it as a platform.  They believed that a comparable browser product offered at no charge would still not be compelling enough to consumers to detract substantially from Navigator’s existing share of browser usage.  This belief was due, at least in part, to the fact that Navigator already enjoyed a very large installed base and had become nearly synonymous with the Web in the public’s consciousness.  If Microsoft was going to raise Internet Explorer’s share of browser usage and lower Navigator’s share, executives at Microsoft believed they needed to constrict Netscape’s access to the distribution channels that led most efficiently to browser usage.</span></p><p><span>1.The Importance of the OEM and IAP Channels</span></p><p><span>144.Very soon after it recognized the need to gain browser usage share at Navigator’s expense, Microsoft identified pre-installation by OEMs and bundling with the proprietary client software of IAPs as the two distribution channels that lead most efficiently to browser usage.  Two main reasons explain why these channels are so efficient.  First, users must acquire a computer and connect to the Internet before they can browse the Web.  Thus, the OEM and IAP channels lead directly to virtually every user of browsing software.  Second, both OEMs and IAPs are able to place browsing software at the immediate disposal of a user without any effort on the part of the user.  If an OEM pre-installs a browser onto its PCs and places an icon for that browser on the default screen, or “desktop,” of the operating system, purchasers of those PCs will be confronted with the icon as soon as the operating system finishes loading into random access memory (“RAM”).  If an IAP bundles a browser with its own proprietary software, its subscribers will, by default, use the browser whenever they connect to the Web.  In its internal decision-</span></p><p><span>making, Microsoft has placed considerable reliance on studies showing that consumers tend strongly to use whatever browsing software is placed most readily at their disposal, and that once they have acquired, found, and used one browser product, most are reluctant — and indeed have little reason — to expend the effort to switch to another.  Microsoft has also relied on studies showing that a very large majority of those who browse the Web obtain their browsing software with either their PCs or their IAP subscriptions.</span></p><p><span>145.Indeed, no other distribution channel for browsing software even approaches the efficiency of OEM pre-installation and IAP bundling.  The primary reason is that the other channels require users to expend effort before they can start browsing.  The traditional retail channel, for example, requires the consumer to make contact with a retailer, and retailers generally do not distribute products without charging a price for them.  Naturally, once Microsoft and Netscape began offering browsing software for free, consumers for the most part lost all incentive to pay for it.</span></p><p><span>146.The relatively few users who already have a browser but would prefer another can avoid the retail channel by using the Internet to download new browsing software electronically, but they must wait for the software to transmit to their PCs.  This process takes a moderate degree of sophistication and substantial amount of time, and as the average bandwidth of PC connections has grown, so has the average size of browser products.  The longer it takes for the software to download, the more likely it is that the user’s connection to the Internet will be interrupted.  As a vanguard of the “Internet Age,” Navigator generated a tremendous amount of excitement in its early days among technical sophisticates, who were willing to devote time and effort to downloading the software.  Today, however, the average Web user is more of a neophyte, and is far more likely to be intimidated by the process of downloading.  It is not surprising, then, that downloaded browsers now make up only a small and decreasing percentage of the new browsers (as opposed to upgrades) that consumers obtain and use.</span></p><p><span>147.The consumer who receives a CD-ROM containing a free browser in the mail or as a magazine insert is at least spared the time and effort it would take to obtain browsing software from a retail vendor or to download it from the Web.  But, just as the consumer who obtains a browser at retail or off the Web, the consumer who receives the software unsolicited at home must first install it on a PC system in order to use it, and merely installing a browser product takes time and can be confusing for novice users.  Plus, a large percentage of the unsolicited disks distributed through “carpet bombing” reach individuals who do not have PCs, who already have pre-installed browsing software, or who have no interest in browsing the Web.  In practice, less than two percent of CD-ROM disks disseminated in mass-distribution campaigns are used in the way the distributor intended.  As a result, this form of distribution is rarely profitable, and then only when undertaken by on-line subscription services for whom a sale translates into a stream of revenues lasting into the future.  The fact that an OLS may find it worthwhile to “carpet bomb” consumers with free disks obviously only helps the vendor of browsing software whose product the OLS has chosen to bundle with its proprietary software.  So, while there are other means of distributing browsers, the fact remains that to a firm interested in browser usage, there simply are no channels that compare in efficiency to OEM pre-installation and IAP bundling.</span></p><p><span>148.Knowing that OEMs and IAPs represented the most efficient distribution channels of browsing software, Microsoft sought to ensure that, to as great an extent as possible, OEMs and IAPs bundled and promoted Internet Explorer to the exclusion of Navigator.</span></p><p><span>2.Excluding Navigator from the OEM Channel</span></p><p><span>a.Binding Internet Explorer to Windows</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>i.The Status of Web Browsers as Separate Products</span></p><p><span>149.Consumers determine their software requirements by identifying the functionalities they desire.  While consumers routinely evaluate software products on the basis of the functionalities the products deliver, they generally lack sufficient information to make judgements based on the designs and implementations of those products.  Accordingly, consumers generally choose which software products to license, install, and use on the basis of the products’ functionalities, not their designs and implementations.</span></p><p><span>150.While the meaning of the term “Web browser” is not precise in all respects, there is a consensus in the software industry as to the functionalities that a Web browser offers a user.  Specifically, a Web browser provides the ability for the end user to select, retrieve, and perceive resources on the Web.  There is also a consensus in the software industry that these functionalities are distinct from the set of functionalities provided by an operating system. </span></p><p><span>151.Many consumers desire to separate their choice of a Web browser from their choice of an operating system.  Some consumers, particularly corporate consumers, demand browsers and operating systems separately because they prefer to standardize on the same browser across different operating systems.  For such consumers, standardizing on the browser of their choice results in increased productivity and lower training and support costs, and permits the establishment of consistent security and privacy policies governing Web access.</span></p><p><span>152.Moreover, many consumers who need an operating system, including a substantial percentage of corporate consumers, do not want a browser at all.  For example, if a consumer has no desire to browse the Web, he may not want a browser taking up memory on his hard disk and slowing his system’s performance.  Also, for businesses desiring to inhibit employees’ access to the Internet while minimizing system support costs, the most efficient solution is often using PC systems without browsers.</span></p><p><span>153.Because of the separate demand for browsers and operating systems, firms have found it efficient to supply the products separately.  A number of operating system vendors offer consumers the choice of licensing their operating systems without a browser.  Others bundle a browser with their operating system products but allow OEMs, value-added resellers, and consumers either to not install it or, if the browser has been pre-installed, to uninstall it.  While Microsoft no longer affords this flexibility (it is the only operating system vendor that does not), it has always marketed and distributed Internet Explorer separately from Windows in several channels.  These include retail sales, service kits for ISVs, free downloads over the Internet, and bundling with other products produced both by Microsoft and by third-party ISVs.</span><span/><span>In order to compete with Navigator for browser share, as well as to satisfy corporate consumers who want their diverse PC platforms to present a common browser interface to employees, Microsoft has also created stand-alone versions of Internet Explorer that run on operating systems other than 32-bit Windows, including the Mac OS and Windows 3.x.</span></p><p><span>154.In conclusion, the preferences of consumers and the responsive behavior of software firms demonstrate that Web browsers and operating systems are separate products.</span></p><p><span>ii.Microsoft’s Actions</span></p><p><span>155.In contrast to other operating system vendors, Microsoft both refused to license its operating system without a browser and imposed restrictions — at first contractual and later technical — on OEMs’ and end users’ ability to remove its browser from its operating system.  As its internal contemporaneous documents and licensing practices reveal, Microsoft decided to bind Internet Explorer to Windows in order to prevent Navigator from weakening the applications barrier to entry, rather than for any pro-competitive purpose.</span></p><p><span>156.Before it decided to blunt the threat that Navigator posed to the applications barrier to entry, Microsoft did not plan to make it difficult or impossible for OEMs or consumers to obtain Windows without obtaining Internet Explorer.  In fact, the company’s internal correspondence and external communications indicate that, as late as the fall of 1994, Microsoft was planning to include low-level Internet “plumbing,” such as a TCP/IP stack, but not a browser, with Windows 95.</span></p><p><span>157.Microsoft subsequently decided to develop a browser to run on Windows 95.  As late as June 1995, however, Microsoft had not decided to bundle that browser with the operating system.  The plan at that point, rather, was to ship the browser in a separate “frosting” package, for which Microsoft intended to charge.  By April or May of that year, however, Microsoft’s top executives had identified Netscape’s browser as a potential threat to the applications barrier to entry.  Throughout the spring, more and more key executives came to the conclusion that Microsoft’s best prospect of quashing that threat lay in maximizing the usage share of Microsoft’s browser at Navigator’s expense.  The executives believed that the most effective way of carrying out this strategy was to ensure that every copy of Windows 95 carried with it a copy of Microsoft’s browser, then code-named “O’Hare.”  For example, two days after the June 21, 1995 meeting between Microsoft and Netscape executives, Microsoft’s John Ludwig sent an E-mail to Paul Maritz and the other senior executives involved in Microsoft’s browser effort.  “[O]bviously netscape does see us as a client competitor,” Ludwig wrote.  “[W]e have to work extra hard to get ohare on the oem disks.”</span></p><p><span>158.Microsoft did manage to bundle Internet Explorer 1.0 with the first version of Windows 95 licensed to OEMs in July 1995.  It also included a term in its OEM licenses that prohibited the OEMs from modifying or deleting any part of Windows 95, including Internet Explorer, prior to shipment.  The OEMs accepted this restriction despite their interest in meeting consumer demand for PC operating systems without Internet Explorer.  After all, Microsoft made the restriction a non-negotiable term in its Windows 95 license, and the OEMs felt they had no commercially viable alternative to pre-installing Windows 95 on their PCs.  Apart from a few months in the fall of 1997, when Microsoft provided OEMs with Internet Explorer 4.0 on a separate disk from Windows 95 and permitted them to ship the latter without the former, Microsoft has never allowed OEMs to ship Windows 95 to consumers without Internet Explorer.  This policy has guaranteed the presence of Internet Explorer on every new Windows PC system.</span></p><p><span>159.Microsoft knew that the inability to remove Internet Explorer made OEMs less disposed to pre-install Navigator onto Windows 95.  OEMs bear essentially all of the consumer support costs for the Windows PC systems they sell.  These include the cost of handling consumer complaints and questions generated by Microsoft’s software.  Pre-installing more than one product in a given category, such as word processors or browsers, onto its PC systems can significantly increase an OEM’s support costs, for the redundancy can lead to confusion among novice users.  In addition, pre-installing a second product in a given software category can increase an OEM’s product testing costs.  Finally, many OEMs see pre-installing a second application in a given software category as a questionable use of the scarce and valuable space on a PC’s hard drive.</span></p><p><span>160.Microsoft’s executives believed that the incentives that its contractual restrictions placed on OEMs would not be sufficient in themselves to reverse the direction of Navigator’s usage share.  Consequently, in late 1995 or early 1996, Microsoft set out to bind Internet Explorer more tightly to Windows 95 as a technical matter.  The intent was to make it more difficult for anyone, including systems administrators and users, to remove Internet Explorer from Windows 95 and to simultaneously complicate the experience of using Navigator with Windows 95.  As Brad Chase wrote to his superiors near the end of 1995, “We will bind the shell to the Internet Explorer, so that running any other browser is a jolting experience.”</span></p><p><span>161.Microsoft bound Internet Explorer to Windows 95 by placing code specific to Web browsing in the same files as code that provided operating system functions.  Starting with the release of Internet Explorer 3.0 and “OEM Service Release 2.0" (“OSR 2") of Windows 95 in August 1996, Microsoft offered only a version of Windows 95 in which browsing-specific code shared files with code upon which non-browsing features of the operating system relied.</span></p><p><span>162.The software code necessary to supply the functionality of a modern application or operating system can be extremely long and complex.  To make that complexity manageable, developers usually write long programs as a series of individual “routines,” each ranging from a few dozen to a few hundred lines of code, that can be used to perform specific functions.  Large programs are created by “knitting” together many such routines in layers, where the lower layers are used to provide fundamental functionality relied upon by higher, more focused layers.  Some preliminary aspects of this “knitting” are performed by the software developer.  The user who launches a program, however, is ultimately responsible for causing routines to be loaded into memory and executed together to produce the program’s overall functionality.</span></p><p><span>163.Routines can be packaged together into files in almost any way the designer chooses.  Routines need not reside in the same file to function together in a seamless fashion.  Also, a developer can move routines into new or different files from one version of a program to another without changing the functionalities of those routines or the ability to combine them to provide integrated functionality.</span></p><p><span>164.Starting with Windows 95 OSR 2, Microsoft placed many of the routines that are used by Internet Explorer, including browsing-specific routines, into the same files that support the 32-bit Windows APIs.  Microsoft’s primary motivation for this action was to ensure that the deletion of any file containing browsing-specific routines would also delete vital operating system routines and thus cripple Windows 95.  Although some of the code that provided Web browsing could still be removed, without disabling the operating system, by entering individual files and selectively deleting routines used only for Web browsing, licensees of Microsoft software were, and are, contractually prohibited from reverse engineering, decompiling, or disassembling any software files.  Even if this were not so, it is prohibitively difficult for anyone who does not have access to the original, human-readable source code to change the placement of routines into files, or otherwise to alter the internal configuration of software files, while still preserving the software’s overall functionality.</span></p><p><span>165.Although users were not able to remove all of the routines that provided Web browsing from OSR 2 and successive versions of Windows 95, Microsoft still provided them with the ability to uninstall Internet Explorer by using the “Add/Remove” panel, which was accessible from the Windows 95 desktop.  The Add/Remove function did not delete all of the files that contain browsing specific code, nor did it remove browsing-specific code that is used by other programs.  The Add/Remove function did, however, remove the functionalities that were provided to the user by Internet Explorer, including the means of launching the Web browser.  Accordingly, from the user’s perspective, uninstalling Internet Explorer in this way was equivalent to removing the Internet Explorer program from Windows 95.</span></p><p><span>166.In late 1996, senior executives within Microsoft, led by James Allchin, began to argue that Microsoft was not binding Internet Explorer tightly enough to Windows and as such was missing an opportunity to maximize the usage of Internet Explorer at Navigator’s expense.  Allchin first made his case to Paul Maritz in late December 1996.  He wrote:</span></p><p><span>I don’t understand how IE is going to win.  The current path is simply to copy everything that Netscape does packaging and product wise.  Let’s [suppose] IE is as good as Navigator/Communicator.  Who wins?  The one with 80% market share.  Maybe being free helps us, but once people are used to a product it is hard to change them.  Consider Office.  We are more expensive today and we’re still winning.  My conclusion is that we must leverage Windows more.  Treating IE as just an add-on to Windows which is cross-platform [means] losing our biggest advantage — Windows marketshare.  We should dedicate a cross group team to come up with ways to leverage Windows technically more. . . . We should think about an integrated solution — that is our strength.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>Allchin followed up with another message to Maritz on January 2, 1997:</span></p><p><span>You see browser share as job 1. . . . I do not feel we are going to win on our current path.  We are not leveraging Windows from a marketing perspective and we are trying to copy Netscape and make IE into a platform.  We do not use our strength — which is that we have an installed base of Windows and we have a strong OEM shipment channel for Windows.  Pitting browser against browser is hard since Netscape has 80% marketshare and we have <20%. . . . I am convinced we have to use Windows — this is the one thing they don’t have. . . . We have to be competitive with features, but we need something more — Windows integration.</span></p><p><span>If you agree that Windows is a huge asset, then it follows quickly that we are not investing sufficiently in finding ways to tie IE and Windows together.  This must come from you. . . . Memphis [Microsoft’s code-name for Windows 98] must be a simple upgrade, but most importantly it must be killer on OEM shipments so that Netscape never gets a chance on these systems.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>167.Maritz responded to Allchin’s second message by agreeing “that we have to make Windows integration our basic strategy” and that this justified delaying the release of Windows 98 until Internet Explorer 4.0 was ready to be included with that product.  Maritz recognized that the delay would disappoint OEMs for two reasons.  First, while OEMs were eager to sell new hardware technologies to Windows users, they could not do this until Microsoft released Windows 98, which included software support for the new technologies.  Second, OEMs wanted Windows 98 to be released in time to drive sales of PC systems during the back-to-school and holiday selling seasons.  Nevertheless, Maritz agreed with Allchin’s point that synchronizing the release of Windows 98 with Internet Explorer was “the only thing that makes sense even if OEMs suffer.” </span></p><p><span>168.Once Maritz had decided that Allchin was right, he needed to instruct the relevant Microsoft employees to delay the release of Windows 98 long enough so that it could be shipped with Internet Explorer 4.0 tightly bound to it.  When one executive asked on January 7, 1997 for confirmation that “memphis is going to hold for IE4, even if it puts memphis out of the xmas oem window,” Maritz responded affirmatively and explained, </span></p><p><span>The major reason for this is . . . to combat Nscp, we have to [] position the browser as “going away” and do deeper integration on Windows.  The stronger way to communicate this is to have a ‘new release’ of Windows and make a big deal out of it. . . . IE integration will be [the] most compelling feature of Memphis.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>Thus, Microsoft delayed the debut of numerous features, including support for new hardware devices, that Microsoft believed consumers would find beneficial, simply in order to protect the applications barrier to entry.</span></p><p><span>169.Allchin and Maritz gained support for their initiative within Microsoft in the early spring of 1997, when a series of market studies confirmed that binding Internet Explorer tightly to Windows was the way to get consumers to use Internet Explorer instead of Navigator.  Reporting on one study in late February, Microsoft’s Christian Wildfeuer wrote:  </span></p><p><span>The stunning insight is this: To make [users] switch away from Netscape, we need to make them upgrade to Memphis. . . . It seems clear to me that it will be very hard to increase browser market share on the merits of IE 4 alone.  It will be more important to leverage the OS asset to make people use IE instead of Navigator.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>Microsoft’s survey expert, Kumar Mehta, agreed.  In March he shared with a colleague his “feeling, based on all the IE research we have done, [that] it is a mistake to release memphis without bundling IE with it.”</span></p><p><span>170.Microsoft’s technical personnel implemented Allchin’s “Windows integration” strategy in two ways.  First, they did not provide users with the ability to uninstall Internet Explorer from Windows 98.  The omission of a browser removal function was particularly conspicuous given that Windows 98 did give users the ability to uninstall numerous features other than Internet Explorer — features that Microsoft also held out as being integrated into Windows 98.  Microsoft took this action despite specific requests from Gateway that Microsoft provide a way to uninstall Internet Explorer 4.0 from Windows 98.  </span></p><p><span>171.The second way in which Microsoft’s engineers implemented Allchin’s strategy was to make Windows 98 override the user’s choice of default browser in certain circumstances.  As shipped to users, Windows 98 has Internet Explorer configured as the default browser.  While Windows 98 does provide the user with the ability to choose a different default browser, it does not treat this choice as the “default browser” within the ordinary meaning of the term.  Specifically, when a user chooses a browser other than Internet Explorer as the default, Windows 98 nevertheless requires the user to employ Internet Explorer in numerous situations that, from the user’s perspective, are entirely unexpected.  As a consequence, users who choose a browser other than Internet Explorer as their default face considerable uncertainty and confusion in the ordinary course of using Windows 98.</span></p><p><span>172.Microsoft’s refusal to respect the user’s choice of default browser fulfilled Brad Chase’s 1995 promise to make the use of any browser other than Internet Explorer on Windows “a jolting experience.”  By increasing the likelihood that using Navigator on Windows 98 would have unpleasant consequences for users, Microsoft further diminished the inclination of OEMs to pre-install Navigator onto Windows.  The decision to override the user’s selection of non-Microsoft software as the default browser also directly disinclined Windows 98 consumers to use Navigator as their default browser, and it harmed those Windows 98 consumers who nevertheless used Navigator.  In particular, Microsoft exposed those using Navigator on Windows 98 to security and privacy risks that are specific to Internet Explorer and to ActiveX controls..</span></p><p><span>173.Microsoft’s actions have inflicted collateral harm on consumers who have no interest in using a Web browser at all.  If these consumers want the non-browsing features available only in Windows 98, they must content themselves with an operating system that runs more slowly than if Microsoft had not interspersed browsing-specific routines throughout various files containing routines relied upon by the operating system.  More generally, Microsoft has forced Windows 98 users uninterested in browsing to carry software that, while providing them with no benefits, brings with it all the costs associated with carrying additional software on a system.  These include performance degradation, increased risk of incompatibilities, and the introduction of bugs.  Corporate consumers who need the hardware support and other non-</span></p><p><span>browsing features not available in earlier versions of Windows, but who do not want Web browsing at all, are further burdened in that they are denied a simple and effective means of preventing employees from attempting to browse the Web.</span></p><p><span>174.Microsoft has harmed even those consumers who desire to use Internet Explorer, and no other browser, with Windows 98.  To the extent that browsing-specific routines have been commingled with operating system routines to a greater degree than is necessary to provide any consumer benefit, Microsoft has unjustifiably jeopardized the stability and security of the operating system.  Specifically, it has increased the likelihood that a browser crash will cause the entire system to crash and made it easier for malicious viruses that penetrate the system </span><span>via</span><span> Internet Explorer to infect non-browsing parts of the system.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>iii.Lack of Justification</span></p><p><span>175.</span><span>No technical reason can explain Microsoft’s refusal to license Windows 95 without Internet Explorer 1.0 and 2.0.  The version of Internet Explorer (1.0) that Microsoft included with the original OEM version of Windows 95 was a separable, executable program file supplied on a separate disk.  Web browsing thus could be installed or removed without affecting the rest of Windows 95's functionality in any way.  The same was true of Internet Explorer 2.0.  Microsoft, moreover, created an easy way to remove Internet Explorer 1.0 and 2.0 from Windows 95 after they had been installed, </span><span>via</span><span> the “Add/Remove” panel.  This demonstrates the absence of any technical reason for Microsoft’s refusal to supply Windows 95 without Internet Explorer 1.0 and 2.0.</span></p><p><span>176.Similarly, there is no technical justification for Microsoft’s refusal to license Windows 95 to OEMs with Internet Explorer 3.0 or 4.0 uninstalled, or for its refusal to permit OEMs to uninstall Internet Explorer 3.0 or 4.0.  Microsoft’s decision to provide users with an “uninstall” procedure for Internet Explorer 3.0 and 4.0 and its decision to promote Internet Explorer on the basis of that feature demonstrate that there was no technical or quality-related reason for refusing to permit OEMs to use this same feature.  Microsoft would not have permitted users to uninstall Internet Explorer, nor would consumers have demanded such an option, if the process would have fragmented or degraded the other functionality of the operating system.</span></p><p><span>177.As with Windows 95, there is no technical justification for Microsoft’s refusal to meet consumer demand for a browserless version of Windows 98.  Microsoft could easily supply a version of Windows 98 that does not provide the ability to browse the Web, and to which users could add the browser of their choice.  Indicative of this is the fact that it remains possible to remove Web browsing functionality from Windows 98 without adversely affecting non-Web browsing features of Windows 98 or the functionality of applications running on the operating system.  In fact, the revised version of Professor Felten’s prototype removal program produces precisely this result when run on a computer with Windows 98 installed.</span></p><p><span>178.In his direct testimony, Felten provides a full technical description of what his prototype removal program does.  This description includes a list of the twenty-one methods of initiating Web browsing in Windows 98 that were known to Felten when he developed his program.  When the revised version of Felten’s program is run on a computer with Windows 98 and no other software installed, Web browsing is not initiated in response to any of these methods.</span></p><p><span>179.James Allchin tried to show at trial, by way of a videotaped demonstration, that the functionality of Internet Explorer could still be enabled, even after the prototype removal program had been run, by manually adding a new entry to the Windows Registry database.  During Felten’s rebuttal testimony, one of Microsoft’s attorneys directed Felten to perform a second demonstration intended to show that the functionality of Internet Explorer could still be enabled, even after the prototype removal program had been run, by hitting the “control” and “N” keys simultaneously after running the Windows Update feature.  Neither of these methods of initiating Web browsing was among the twenty-one documented methods known to Felten when he developed his program.  Furthermore, the latter demonstration was hardly a reliable test of Felten’s program, because the Encompass shell browser and other applications had been installed on the Windows 98 PC system used in the demonstration.  At most, the two demonstrations indicate that Felten did not know all of the methods of initiating Web browsing in Windows 98 when he developed his program, and that he did not include steps in his program to prevent the invocation of Internet Explorer’s functionality in response to methods of which he was unaware.  Microsoft has special knowledge of its own products, and it alone chooses which functionalities in its products are to be documented and which are to be left undocumented.  Felten was aware of this fact, and he himself noted that his own documentation of initiation methods was not exhaustive.</span></p><p><span>180.Allchin also attempted to show that Felten’s program causes performance degradations in Windows 98, as well as malfunctions in certain Windows 98 applications and the Windows Update feature of Windows 98.  Those demonstrations, however, were performed on a PC on which several third-party software programs had been installed in addition to Windows 98, and which had been connected to the Internet </span><span>via</span><span> a dial-up connection.  Felten’s program was not intended to be definitive and had not been verified under preconditions other than those for which it was designed.  Thus, there was no reason to expect that his program would operate flawlessly during Allchin’s demonstrations, and nothing can be inferred from any failure to do so.</span></p><p><span>181.In fact, the revised version of Felten’s program does not degrade the performance or stability of Windows 98 in any way.  To the contrary, according to several standard programs used by Microsoft to measure system performance, the removal of Internet Explorer by the prototype program slightly improves the overall speed of Windows 98.</span></p><p><span>182.Given Microsoft’s special knowledge of its own products, the company is readily able to produce an improved implementation of the concept illustrated by Felten’s prototype removal program.  In particular, Microsoft can easily identify browsing-specific code that could be removed from shared files, thereby reducing the operating system’s memory and hard disk requirements and obtaining performance improvements even beyond those achieved by Felten.</span></p><p><span>183.Microsoft contends that Felten’s prototype removal program does not remove Internet Explorer’s Web browsing functionalities, but rather “hides” those functionalities from the perspective of the user.  In support of that contention, Microsoft points out that Felten’s program removes only a small fraction of the code in Windows 98, so that the hard drive still contains almost all of the code that had been executed in the course of providing Internet Explorer’s Web browsing functionalities.  Some of that code is left on the hard drive because it also supports Windows 98's operating system functionalities.  Microsoft did not offer any analytical basis, however, for distinguishing this sharing of code from the code sharing that exists between all Windows applications and the operating system functionalities in Windows 98.</span></p><p><span>184.While Microsoft’s observation suggests that Felten’s program does not greatly reduce Windows 98's “footprint” on the hard disk, that point is irrelevant to the question of whether Felten’s program removes Internet Explorer’s functionalities from Windows 98.  This is because the functionalities of a software product are not provided by the mere presence of code on a computer’s hard drive.  For software code to provide any functionalities at all the code must be loaded into the computer’s dynamic memory and executed.  To uninstall a software program or to remove a set of functionalities from a software program, it is not necessary to delete all of the software code that is executed in the course of providing those functionalities.  It is sufficient to delete and/or modify enough of the program so as to prevent the code in question from being executed.</span></p><p><span>185.This deletion and modification is precisely what Felten’s program does to Windows 98.  After Felten’s program has been run, the software code that formerly had been executed in the course of providing Web browsing functionalities is no longer executed.  Web browsing functionalities are not merely “hidden” from the user.  To the contrary, Felten’s program deletes and modifies enough of Windows 98 so as to prevent the necessary code from being executed altogether.  Since code that is not to be executed does not need to be loaded into memory, Felten’s program is able to reduce the memory allocated to Windows 98 by approximately twenty percent.</span></p><p><span>186.As an abstract and general proposition, many — if not most — consumers can be said to benefit from Microsoft’s provision of Web browsing functionality with its Windows operating system at no additional charge.  No consumer benefit can be ascribed, however, to Microsoft’s refusal to offer a version of Windows 95 or Windows 98 without Internet Explorer, or to Microsoft’s refusal to provide a method for uninstalling Internet Explorer from Windows 98.  In particular, Microsoft’s decision to force users to take the browser in order to get the non-</span></p><p><span>Web browsing features of Windows 98, including support for new Internet protocols and data formats is, as Allchin put it, simply a choice about “distribution.”</span></p><p><span>187.As Felten’s program demonstrated, it is feasible for Microsoft to supply a version of Windows 98 that does not provide the ability to browse the Web, to which users could add a browser of their choice.  Microsoft could then readily offer “integrated” Internet Explorer Web browsing functionality as well, either as an option that could be selected by the end user or the OEM during the Windows 98 setup procedure, or as a “service pack upgrade.”</span></p><p><span>188.Unlike a “pocket part” supplement to a book, a software upgrade need not consist only of new material.  A service pack upgrade may install a combination of new software files and/or replacements for existing software files.  The use of such service packs to distribute new functionality is a standard feature of Windows applications generally.  Microsoft could offer “integrated” Internet Explorer Web browsing functionality as a service pack upgrade that would locate the relevant software and replace it with the current Windows 98 software.  In this way, any consumer who wished to do so could easily acquire all of the functionality, features, and performance of the current version of Windows 98 by obtaining the browserless operating system package and the service pack upgrade and then installing them together.</span></p><p><span>189.Microsoft contends that a service pack must necessarily be deemed part of the operating system when it replaces and adds a large number of core operating system files in the process of upgrading the operating system to a higher level of functionality.  This contention is false.  Both Microsoft Word, an application program, and Norton Utilities, a suite of utility and application programs, replace and add files to Windows without thereby becoming part of the operating system.</span></p><p><span>190.Microsoft’s actual use of a service pack upgrade to offer integrated Internet Explorer Web browsing functionality (Internet Explorer 4.0) separately from the Windows 95 operating system illustrates the feasibility of this approach.  In fact, it produces results remarkably similar to those that could be achieved by offering integrated Internet Explorer Web browsing functionality as a separate service pack upgrade to a browserless Windows 98 operating system.  When installed together by the end user, the combined software provides nearly all of the features that Microsoft attributes to the “integrated” design of Windows 98.  Of the missing features, all but WebTV for Windows can be obtained by thereafter installing a separately obtained copy of Internet Explorer 5.0.  Microsoft has presented no evidence that the WebTV functionality could not easily be included in the stand-alone version of Internet Explorer 5.0.</span></p><p><span>191.Therefore, Microsoft could offer consumers all the benefits of the current Windows 98 package by distributing the products separately and allowing OEMs or consumers themselves to combine the products if they wished.  In fact, operating system vendors other than Microsoft currently succeed in offering “integrated” features similar to those that Microsoft advertises in Windows 98 while still permitting the removal of the browser from the operating system.  If consumers genuinely prefer a version of Windows bundled with Internet Explorer, they do not have to be forced to take it; they can choose it in the market.</span></p><p><span>192.Windows 98 offers some benefits unrelated to browsing that a consumer cannot obtain by combining Internet Explorer with Windows 95.  For example, Windows 98 includes support for new hardware technologies and data formats that consumers may desire.  While nevertheless preferring to do without Web browsing, Microsoft has forced Windows users who do not want Internet Explorer to nevertheless license, install, and use Internet Explorer to obtain the unrelated benefits.  Although some consumers might be inclined to go without Windows 98's new non-browsing features in order to avoid Internet Explorer, OEMs are unlikely to facilitate that choice, because they want consumers to use an operating system that supports the new hardware technologies they seek to sell.</span></p><p><span>193.Microsoft’s argument that binding the browser to the operating system is reasonably necessary to preserve the “integrity” of the Windows platform is likewise specious.  First, concern with the integrity of the platform cannot explain Microsoft’s original decision to bind Internet Explorer to Windows 95, because Internet Explorer 1.0 and 2.0 did not contain APIs.  Second, concern with the integrity of the platform cannot explain Microsoft’s refusal to offer OEMs the option of uninstalling Internet Explorer from Windows 95 and Windows 98 because APIs, like all other shared files, are left on the system when Internet Explorer in uninstalled.  Third, Microsoft’s contention that offering OEMs the choice of whether or not to install certain browser-related APIs would fragment the Windows platform is unpersuasive because OEMs operate in a competitive market and thus have ample incentive to include APIs (including non-Microsoft APIs) required by the applications that their customers demand.  Fourth, even if there were some potential benefit associated with the forced licensing of a single set of APIs to all OEMs, such justification could not apply in this case, because Microsoft itself precipitates fragmentation of its platform by continually updating various portions of the Windows installed base with new APIs.  ISVs have adapted to this reality by redistributing needed APIs with their applications in order to ensure that the necessary APIs are present when the programs are launched.  To the same end, Microsoft makes the APIs it ships with Internet Explorer available to third-party developers for distribution with their own products.  Moreover, Microsoft itself bundles APIs — including those distributed with Internet Explorer — with a number of the applications that it distributes separately from Windows.</span></p><p><span>194.Microsoft also contends that by providing “best of breed” implementations of various functionalities, a vendor of a popular operating system can benefit consumers and improve the efficiency of the software market generally, because the resulting standardization allows ISVs to concentrate their efforts on developing complementary technologies for the industry leaders.  Microsoft’s refusal to offer a version of Windows 98 in which its Web browser is either absent or removable, however, had no such purpose.  Rather, it had the purpose and effect of quashing innovation that exhibited the potential to facilitate the emergence of competition in the market for Intel-compatible PC operating systems.</span></p><p><span>195.Furthermore, there is only equivocal support for the proposition that Microsoft will ultimately prove to be the source of a “best of breed” Web browser.  In fact, there is considerable evidence to the contrary.  Both Microsoft and the plaintiffs have used product evaluations to support their claims about the relationship between innovations in Web browser technology and consumer choices regarding the use of Web browsers.  These product evaluations generally compare Internet Explorer with Navigator by identifying the beneficial and detrimental features of each.  Because the evaluations disagree as to which features are most important, there is no consensus as to which is the best browser overall.  When read together, the evaluations also do not identify any existing Web browser as being “best of breed” in the sense of being at least as good as all others in all significant respects.  Moreover, there is nothing in the evaluations, nor anywhere else in the evidence, to suggest that further innovation efforts by vendors other than Microsoft in the field of Web browser technology are no longer necessary or desirable.  To the contrary, many of the product reviews suggest further innovations in both Microsoft and non-</span></p><p><span>Microsoft Web browsers that would benefit consumers.</span></p><p><span>196.Despite differences in emphasis, the product evaluations do generally concur as to which browser features are beneficial, which browser features are detrimental, and why.  Thus, the evaluations provide extensive detailed information about consumer preferences that can be used to predict likely directions in the evolution of Web browser technology.</span></p><p><span>197.First, the evaluations suggest that, although most Web publishers charge nothing for access to their sites, consumers recognize that there are search and communication costs associated with Web transactions.  Accordingly, consumers prefer, and benefit from, innovations in Web browser technology that reduce these costs.  Second, consumers recognize that the Web contains a vast and growing range of digital information resources, many of which contain viruses that are capable of causing devastating and irreversible harm to their security and privacy interests.  Accordingly, consumers prefer, and benefit from, innovations in Web browser technology that help them identify and avoid harmful Web resources.  Third, consumers recognize that they frequently lack adequate information to enable them to assess accurately the costs, risks, and benefits of performing a particular Web transaction.  Accordingly, consumers prefer, and benefit from, innovations in Web browser technology that help them assess these costs, risks, and benefits prior to performing the transaction.</span></p><p><span>198.The reduction of search and communication costs, the identification and avoidance of harmful Web resources, and the provision of more accurate information as to the costs, risks, and benefits of performing Web transactions are just three of the many possible areas of innovation in the field of Web browser technology.  Far from demonstrating that Internet Explorer is currently a “best of breed” Web browser, the evidence reveals Microsoft’s awareness of the need for continuous improvement of its products.  For example, Microsoft frequently releases “patches” to address security and privacy vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer as they are discovered.  In sum, there is no indication that Microsoft is destined to provide a “best of breed” Web browser that makes continuing, competitively driven innovations unproductive.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>iv.The Market for Web Browsing Functionality</span></p><p><span>199.Since the World Wide Web was introduced to the public in 1991, the resources available on the Web have multiplied at a near-exponential rate.  The Internet is becoming a true mass medium.  Every day Web resources are published, combined, modified, moved, and deleted.  Millions of individuals and organizations have published Web sites, and Web site addresses are pervasive in advertising, promotion, and corporate identification.</span></p><p><span>200.The economics of the Internet, along with the flexible structure of Web pages, have made the Web the leading trajectory for the ongoing convergence of mass communications media.  Many television and radio stations make some or all of their transmissions available on the Web in the form of static multimedia files or streaming media.  Many newspapers, magazines, books, journals, public documents, and software programs are also published on the Web.  Multimedia files on the Web have emerged as viable substitutes for many pre-recorded audio and video entertainment products.  Web-based E-mail, discussion lists, news groups, “chat rooms,” paging, instant messaging, and telephony are all in common use.  In addition to subsuming all other digital media, the Web also offers popular interactive and collaborative modes of communication that are not available through other media.</span></p><p><span>201.The use of Web browsers to conduct Web transactions has grown at pace with the growth of the Web, reflecting the immense value that subsists in the digital information resources that have become available on the Web.  Consumer demand for software functionality that facilitates Web transactions, and the response by browser vendors to that demand, creates a market for Web browsing functionality.  Although Web browsers are now generally not licensed at a positive price, all Web transactions impose significant costs on consumers, and all browser vendors, including Microsoft, have significant economic interests in maximizing usage of the browsing functionality they control.</span></p><p><span>b.Preventing OEMs from Removing the Ready Means of Accessing Internet Explorer and from Promoting Navigator</span><span/><span>in the Boot Sequence</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>202.Since the release of Internet Explorer 1.0 in July 1995, Microsoft has distributed every version of Windows with Internet Explorer included.  Consequently, no OEM has ever (with the exception of a few months in late 1997) been able to license a copy of Windows 95 or Windows 98 that has not come with Internet Explorer.  Refusing to offer OEMs a browserless (and appropriately discounted) version of Windows forces OEMs to take (and pay for) Internet Explorer, but it does not prevent a determined OEM from nevertheless offering its consumers a different Web browser.  Even Microsoft’s additional refusal to allow OEMs to uninstall (without completely removing) Internet Explorer from Windows does not completely foreclose a resourceful OEM from offering consumers another browser.  For example, an OEM with sufficient technical expertise (which all the larger OEMs certainly possess) could offer its customers a choice of browsers while still minimizing user confusion if the OEM were left free to configure its systems to present this choice the first time a user turned on a new PC system.  If the user chose Navigator, the system would automatically remove the most prominent means of accessing Internet Explorer from Windows (without actually uninstalling, </span><span>i.e.</span><span>, removing all means of accessing, Internet Explorer) before the desktop screen appeared for the first time.  </span></p><p><span>203.If OEMs removed the most visible means of invoking Internet Explorer, and pre-</span></p><p><span>installed Navigator with facile methods of access, Microsoft’s purpose in forcing OEMs to take Internet Explorer — capturing browser usage share from Netscape — would be subverted.  The same would be true if OEMs simply configured their machines to promote Navigator before Windows had a chance to promote Internet Explorer,  Decision-makers at Microsoft believed that as Internet Explorer caught up with Navigator in quality, OEMs would ultimately conclude that the costs of pre-installing and promoting Navigator, and removing easy access to Internet Explorer, outweighed the benefits.  Still, those decision-makers did not believe that Microsoft could afford to wait for the several large OEMs that represented virtually all Windows PCs shipped to come to this desired conclusion on their own.  Therefore, in order to bring the behavior of OEMs into line with its strategic goals quickly, Microsoft threatened to terminate the Windows license of any OEM that removed Microsoft’s chosen icons and program entries from the Windows desktop or the “Start” menu.  It threatened similar punishment for OEMs who added programs that promoted third-party software to the Windows “boot” sequence.  These inhibitions soured Microsoft’s relations with OEMs and stymied innovation that might have made Windows PC systems more satisfying to users.  Microsoft would not have paid this price had it not been convinced that its actions were necessary to ostracize Navigator from the vital OEM distribution channel.</span></p><p><span>204.Although Microsoft’s original Windows 95 licenses withheld from OEMs permission to implement any modifications to the Windows product not expressly authorized by Microsoft’s “OEM Pre-Installation Kit,” or “OPK,” it had always been Microsoft’s practice to grant certain OEMs requesting it some latitude to make modifications not specified in the OPK.  But when OEMs began, in the summer of 1995, to request permission to remove the Internet Explorer icon from the Windows desktop prior to shipping their PCs, Microsoft consistently and steadfastly refused.  As Compaq learned in the first half of 1996, Microsoft was prepared to enforce this prohibition against even its closest OEM allies.</span></p><p><span>205.In August 1995, Compaq entered into a “Promotion and Distribution Agreement” with AOL whereby Compaq agreed to “position AOL Services above all other Online Services within the user interface of its Products.”  An addendum to the agreement provided that Compaq would place an AOL icon — and no OLS icons not controlled by AOL — on the desktop of its PCs.  Pursuant to its obligations, Compaq began in late 1995 or early 1996 to ship its Presario PCs with the MSN icon removed and the AOL icon added to the Windows desktop.  At the same time, Compaq removed the Internet Explorer icon from the desktop of its Presarios and replaced it with a single icon representing both the Spry ISP and the browser product that Spry bundled, </span><span>i.e.</span><span>, Navigator.  Compaq added this icon in part because it recognized Navigator to be the most popular browser product with its consumers; it removed the Internet Explorer icon because it did not want its PCs desktops to confuse novice users with a clutter of Internet-related icons.</span></p><p><span>206.When Microsoft learned of Compaq’s plans for the Presario, it informed Compaq that it considered the removal of the MSN and Internet Explorer icons to be a violation of the OPK process by which Compaq had previously agreed to abide.  For its part, AOL informed Compaq that it viewed the addition of an icon for Spry as a violation of their 1995 agreement.  AOL did not object to the presence of a Navigator icon; what concerned AOL was the fact that clicking on this icon brought the user to the Spry ISP.  Despite the protests from Microsoft and AOL, Compaq refused to reconfigure the Presario desktop.  Finally, after months of unsuccessful importunity, Microsoft sent Compaq a letter on May 31, 1996, stating its intention to terminate Compaq’s license for Windows 95 if Compaq did not restore the MSN and Internet Explorer icons to their original positions.  Compaq’s executives opined that their firm could not continue in business for long without a license for Windows, so in June Compaq restored the MSN and IE icons to the Presario desktop.  </span></p><p><span>207.Microsoft did not further condition its withdrawal of the termination notice on the removal of the AOL and Navigator icons; AOL, however, did protest both the continued presence of a Spry icon and the reappearance of the MSN icon.  After AOL sent Compaq a formal notice of its intent to terminate the Promotion and Distribution Agreement in September 1996, Compaq removed the Spry/Navigator icon.  For reasons discussed below, Compaq did not then replace the Spry/Navigator icon with an icon solely for Navigator.</span></p><p><span>208.In its confrontation with Compaq, Microsoft demonstrated that it was prepared to go to the brink of losing all Windows sales through its highest-volume OEM partner in order to enforce its prohibition against removing Microsoft’s Internet-related icons from the Windows desktop.  </span></p><p><span>209.If the only prohibition had been against removing Microsoft icons and program entries, OEMs partial to Navigator still would have been able to recruit users to Navigator by configuring their PCs to promote it before the Windows desktop first presented itself.  This is true because the average user, having chosen a browser product, is indisposed to undergo the trouble of switching to a different one.  With the release of Windows 95, some of the high-volume OEMs began to customize the Windows boot sequence so that, the first time users turned on their new PCs, certain OEM-designed tutorials and registration programs, as well as “splash” screens that simply displayed the OEM’s brand, would run before the users were presented with the Windows desktop.</span></p><p><span>  210.Promoting non-Microsoft software and services was not the only, or even the primary, purpose of the OEM introductory programs.  The primary purpose, rather, was to make the experience of setting up and learning to use a new PC system easier and less confusing for users, especially novices.  By doing so, the OEMs believed, they would increase the value of their systems and minimize both product returns and costly support calls.  Since just three calls from a consumer can erase the entire profit that an OEM earned selling a PC system to that consumer, OEMs have an acute interest in making their systems self-explanatory and simple to use.  A secondary purpose motivating OEMs to insert programs into the boot sequence was to differentiate their products from those of their competitors.  Finally, OEMs perceived an opportunity to collect bounties from IAPs and ISVs in exchange for the promotion of their services and software in the boot sequence.  Thus, among the programs that many OEMs inserted into the boot sequence were Internet sign-up procedures that encouraged users to choose from a list of IAPs assembled by the OEM.  In many cases, a consumer signing up for an IAP through an OEM program would automatically become a user of whichever browser that IAP bundled with its proprietary software.  In other cases, the IAP would present the user with a choice of browsers in the course of collecting from the user the information necessary to start a subscription.</span></p><p><span>211.In addition to tutorials, sign-up programs, and splash screens, a few large OEMs developed programs that ran automatically at the conclusion of a new PC system’s first boot sequence.  These programs replaced the Windows desktop either with a user interface designed by the OEM or with Navigator’s user interface.  The OEMs that implemented automatically loading alternative user interfaces did so out of the belief that many users, particularly novice ones, would find the alternate interfaces less complicated and confusing than the Windows desktop.</span></p><p><span>212.When Gates became aware of what the OEMs were doing, he expressed concern to Kempin, the Microsoft executive in charge of OEM sales.  On January 6, 1996, Gates wrote to Kempin: “Winning Internet browser share is a very very important goal for us.  Apparently a lot of OEMs are bundling non-Microsoft browsers and coming up with offerings together with Internet Service providers that get displayed on their machines in a FAR more prominent way than MSN or our Internet browser.”  Less than three weeks later, Kempin delivered his semi-</span></p><p><span>annual report on OEM sales to his superiors.  In the report, he identified “Control over start-up screens, MSN and IE placement” as one interest that Microsoft had neglected over the previous six months.  The ongoing imbroglio with Compaq was prominent in Kempin’s thinking, but he also recognized that establishing control over the boot process was necessary to ensure preferential positioning for MSN and Internet Explorer.</span></p><p><span>213.In an effort to thwart the practice of OEM customization, Microsoft began, in the spring of 1996, to force OEMs to accept a series of restrictions on their ability to reconfigure the Windows 95 desktop and boot sequence.  There were five such restrictions, which were manifested either as amendments to existing Windows 95 licenses or as terms in new Windows 98 licenses.  First, Microsoft formalized the prohibition against removing any icons, folders, or “Start” menu entries that Microsoft itself had placed on the Windows desktop.  Second, Microsoft prohibited OEMs from modifying the initial Windows boot sequence.  Third, Microsoft prohibited OEMs from installing programs, including alternatives to the Windows desktop user interface, which would launch automatically upon completion of the initial Windows boot sequence.  Fourth, Microsoft prohibited OEMs from adding icons or folders to the Windows desktop that were not similar in size and shape to icons supplied by Microsoft.  Finally, when Microsoft later released the Active Desktop as part of Internet Explorer 4.0, it added the restriction that OEMs were not to use that feature to display third-party brands.</span></p><p><span>214.The several OEMs that in the aggregate represented over ninety percent of Intel-</span></p><p><span>compatible PC sales believed that the new restrictions would make their PC systems more difficult and more confusing to use, and thus less acceptable to consumers.  They also anticipated that the restrictions would increase product returns and support costs and generally lower the value of their machines.  Those OEMs that had already spent millions of dollars developing and implementing tutorial and registration programs and/or automatically-loading graphical interfaces in the Windows boot sequence lamented that their investment would, as a result of Microsoft’s policy, be largely wasted.  Gateway, Hewlett-Packard, and IBM communicated their opposition forcefully and urged Microsoft to lift the restrictions.  Emblematic of the reaction among large OEMs was a letter that the manager of research and development at Hewlett-Packard sent to Microsoft in March 1997.  He wrote:</span></p><p><span>Microsoft’s mandated removal of all OEM boot-sequence and auto-start programs for OEM licensed systems has resulted in significant and costly problems for the HP-Pavilion line of retail PC’s.  </span></p><p><span>Our data (as of 3/10/97) shows a 10% increase in W[indows]95 calls as a % of our total customer support calls . . . .  </span></p><p><span>Our registration rate has also dropped from the mid-80% range to the low 60% range.  </span></p><p><span>There is also subjective data from several channel partners that our system return rate has increased from the lowest of any OEM (even lower than Apple) to a level comparable to the other Microsoft OEM PC vendors.  This is a major concern in that we are taking a step backward in meeting customer satisfaction needs.</span></p><p><span>These three pieces of data confirm that we have been damaged by the edicts that [] Microsoft issued last fall. . . .  </span></p><p><span>From the consumer perspective, we are hurting our industry and our customers.  PC’s can be frightening and quirky pieces of technology into which they invest a large sum of their money.  It is vitally important that the PC suppliers dramatically improve the consumer buying experience, out of box experience as well as the longer term product usability and reliability.  The channel feedback as well as our own data shows that we are going in the wrong direction.  This causes consumer dissatisfaction in complex telephone support process, needless in-home repair visits and ultimately in product returns.  Many times the cause is user misunderstanding of a product that presents too much complexity to the common user. . . . </span></p><p><span>Our Customers hold HP accountable for their dissatisfaction with our products.  We bear [] the cost of returns of our products.  We are responsible for the cost of technical support of our customers, including the 33% of calls we get related to the lack of quality or confusion generated by your product.  And finally we are responsible for our success or failure in the retail PC market.</span></p><p><span>We must have more ability to decide how our system is presented to our end users.</span></p><p><span>If we had a choice of another supplier, based on your actions in this area, I assure you [that you] would not be our supplier of choice.</span></p><p><span>I strongly urge you to have your executives review these decisions and to change this unacceptable policy.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>215.Even in the face of such strident opposition from its OEM customers, Microsoft refused to relent on the bulk of its restrictions.  It did, however, grant Hewlett-Packard and other OEMs discounts off the royalty price of Windows as compensation for the work required to bring their respective alternative user interfaces into compliance with Microsoft’s requirements.  Despite the high costs that Microsoft’s demands imposed on them, the OEMs obeyed the restrictions because they perceived no alternative to licensing Windows for pre-installation on their PCs.  Still, the restrictions lowered the value that OEMs attached to Windows by the amount of the costs that the restrictions imposed on them.  Furthermore, Microsoft’s intransigence damaged the goodwill between it and several of the highest-volume OEMs.  </span></p><p><span>216.Microsoft was willing to sacrifice some goodwill and some of the value that OEMs attached to Windows in order to exclude Netscape from the crucial OEM distribution channel.  Microsoft’s restrictions succeeded in raising the costs to OEMs of pre-installing and promoting Navigator.  These increased costs, in turn, were in some cases significant enough to deter OEMs from pre-installing Navigator altogether.  In other cases, as is discussed in the next section, OEMs decided not to pre-install Navigator after Microsoft brought still more pressure to bear.</span></p><p><span>217.Microsoft’s license agreements have never prohibited OEMs from pre-installing programs, including Navigator, on their PCs and placing icons and entries for those programs on the Windows desktop and in the “Start” menu.  The icons and entries that Microsoft itself places on the desktop and in the “Start” menu have always left room for OEMs to insert more icons and program entries of their own choosing.  In fact, Microsoft leaves enough space for an OEM to add more than forty icons to the Windows desktop.  Still, the availability of space for added icons did not make including a Navigator icon inexpensive for OEMs.  Given the unavoidable presence of the Internet Explorer and MSN icons, adding a Navigator icon would increase the amount of Internet-related clutter on the desktop.  This would lead to confusion among novice users, which would in turn increase the incidence of support calls and product returns.  Microsoft made this very point clear to OEMs in its attempts to persuade them not to pre-install Navigator on their PCs.  Furthermore, OEMs recognized that including multiple Navigator icons in an attempt to draw users’ attention away from Internet Explorer would only increase the amount of clutter on the desktop, thus adding to user confusion.  Although the Windows 98 OEM license does not forbid the OEM to set Navigator as the default browsing software, doing so would fail to forestall user confusion since, as the Court found in the previous section, Windows 98 launches Internet Explorer in certain situations even if Navigator is set as the default.</span></p><p><span>218.The restrictions on modifying the Windows boot sequence, including the prohibition against automatically loading alternate user interfaces, deprived OEMs of the principal devices by which to lure users to Navigator over the high-profile presence of Internet Explorer in the Windows user interface.  An OEM remained free to place an icon on the desktop that a user could click to invoke an alternate user interface.  Plus, once invoked, the interface could be configured to load automatically the next time the PC was turned on.  This mode of presentation proved to be much less effective than the one Microsoft foreclosed, however, for studies showed that users tended not to trouble with selecting an alternate user interface; they were content to use the interface that loaded automatically the first time they turned on their PCs.  Furthermore, while Microsoft’s restrictions never extended to the interval between the time when the PC was turned on and the time when Windows began loading from the hard drive into RAM, developing anything more complicated than a simple splash screen to run in that period would have involved, at a minimum, the writing of a DOS utility and, at the maximum, the pre-installation of a second operating system.  Such measures were simply not worth the cost.  Finally, although the Windows 98 license does not prohibit an OEM from including on the keyboard of its PCs a button that takes users directly to an OEM-maintained site containing promotion for Navigator, such a configuration is extremely costly for an OEM to implement, and it represents a less effective form of promotion than automatically advertising Navigator in the initial boot process.</span></p><p><span>219.In the spring of 1998, Microsoft began gradually to moderate certain of the restrictions described above.  The first sign of relaxation came when Microsoft permitted some fifty OEMs to include ISPs of their choice in Microsoft’s Internet Connection Wizard.  Then, in late May and early June 1998, Microsoft informed seven of the highest-volume OEMs that it was granting them the privilege of inserting their own registration and Internet sign-up programs into the initial Windows 98 boot sequence.  If the user selected an IAP using the OEM program, Microsoft’s Internet Connection Wizard would not run in the boot sequence.  Microsoft subsequently extended these same privileges to several other OEMs, upon their request.</span></p><p><span>220.It is important to note that Microsoft’s tractability emerged only after the restrictions had been in place for over a year, and only after Microsoft had managed to secure favorable promotion for Internet Explorer through the most important IAPs.  Furthermore, while Microsoft permitted the OEMs to include in their registration and sign-up programs promotions for their own products (including OEM-branded shell browsers built upon Internet Explorer) and for ISPs (but only if and when those ISPs were selected by consumers in the sign-up process), Microsoft continued to prohibit promotions for any other non-Microsoft products, including Navigator.  In a single exception, Microsoft granted Gateway’s request that it be permitted to give consumers who used Gateway’s sign-up process and selected Gateway.net as their ISP an opportunity to choose Navigator as their browser.  Microsoft granted this permission orally, and it did not extend similar privileges to any other OEMs.</span></p><p><span>221.Microsoft asserts that the restrictions it places on the ability of OEMs to modify the Windows desktop and boot sequence are merely intended to prevent OEMs from compromising the quality and consistency of Windows after the code leaves Microsoft’s physical control, but before PC consumers first begin to experience the product.  In truth, however, the OEM modifications that Microsoft prohibits would not compromise the quality or consistency of Windows any more than the modifications that Microsoft currently permits.  Furthermore, to the extent that certain OEM modifications did threaten to impair the quality and consistency of Windows, Microsoft’s response has been more restrictive than necessary to abate the threat.  Microsoft would not have imposed prohibitions that burdened OEMs and consumers with substantial costs, lowered the value of Windows, and harmed the company’s relations with major OEMs had it not felt that the measures were necessary to maximize Internet Explorer’s share of browser usage at Navigator’s expense.</span></p><p><span>222.Microsoft asserts that it restricts the freedom of OEMs to remove icons, folders, or “Start” menu entries that Microsoft places on the Windows desktop in order to ensure that consumers will enjoy ready access to the features that Microsoft’s advertising has led them to expect.  The Windows trademark would be blemished, Microsoft argues, if consumers could not easily find the features that impelled them to purchase a Windows-equipped  PC.  At the same time that it has put forward this justification, however, Microsoft has permitted OEMs to de-</span></p><p><span>activate Microsoft’s Active Desktop and its associated “channels” prior to shipment.  More significant is the fact that Microsoft’s license agreements require OEMs to bear product support costs.  So if a consumer has difficulty locating a feature that he wants to use, he will call a customer service representative employed by the OEM that manufactured his PC.  Since only a few calls erase the profit earned from selling a PC system, OEMs are loathe to do anything that will lead to consumer questions and complaints.  Therefore, if market research indicates that consumers want and expect to see a certain icon on the Windows desktop, OEMs will not remove it.  Since OEMs share Microsoft’s interest in ensuring that consumers can easily find the features they want on their Windows PC systems, Microsoft would not have prohibited OEMs from removing icons, folders, or “Start” menu entries if its only concern had been consumer satisfaction.  In fact, by forbidding OEMs to remove the most obvious means of invoking Internet Explorer, Microsoft diminished the value of Windows PC systems to those corporate customers, for example, who did not intend for their employees to browse the Web and did not want a browser taking up hardware resources.  Incidentally, there is no merit in the hypothesis that OEMs might cause problems in the functioning of the rest of Windows by removing Internet Explorer’s desktop icon and program entry, because Microsoft still allows users to do exactly that.</span></p><p><span>223.According to Microsoft, its restrictions on the ability of OEMs to insert programs into the initial Windows boot sequence are meant to ensure that all Windows users experience the product the way Microsoft intended it the first time they turn on their PC systems; after all, there would be little incentive to develop a high-quality operating-system product if OEMs were free to alter it for the worse before handing it over to consumers.  This argument might be availing were it not for the fact that Microsoft currently allows several of the largest-volume OEMs to make major modifications to the initial Windows 98 boot sequence.  Microsoft permits each of these OEMs to configure its own splash screens, tutorials, registration wizards, Internet sign-up wizards, and utilities so that they run automatically when the consumer first turns on a new PC system.  Either Microsoft stopped caring about the consistency of the Windows experience in 1998, when it tempered its restrictions on modifications to the boot sequence, or preserving consistency was never Microsoft’s true motivation for imposing those restrictions in the first place.  With all the variety that Microsoft now tolerates in the boot sequence, including the promotion of OEM-branded browser shells, it is difficult to comprehend how allowing OEMs to promote Navigator in their tutorials and Internet sign-up programs would further compromise Microsoft’s purported interest in consistency.</span></p><p><span>224.Although Microsoft has tolerated a variety of OEM modifications to the Windows boot sequence, it has never acquiesced to an alternate user interface that automatically obscures the Windows desktop after the PC system has finished booting for the first time.  In demanding the removal of such automatically loading user interfaces, Microsoft has postulated that consumers who purchase Windows PCs expect to see the Windows desktop when their PC systems finish booting for the first time.  If consumers instead see a different user interface, they will be confused and disappointed.  What is more, Microsoft asserts, OEM shells have tended to be of lower quality than Windows.  One OEM’s version allegedly even disabled the ability of a Windows user to invoke functionality by clicking the right button of his mouse.  </span></p><p><span>225.The alternate shells that OEMs have developed may or may not be of lower quality than Windows.  One thing is clear, however:  If an OEM develops a shell that users do not like as much as Windows, and if the OEM causes that shell to load as the default user interface the first time its PCs are turned on, consumer wrath will fall first upon the OEM, and demand for that OEM’s PC systems will decline commensurately with the resulting user dissatisfaction.  The market for Intel-compatible PCs is, by all accounts, a competitive one.  Consequently, any OEM that tries to force an unwanted, low-quality shell on consumers will do so at its own peril.  Had Microsoft’s sole concern been consumer satisfaction, it would have relied more on the power of the market — and less on its own market power — to prevent OEMs from making modifications that lead to consumer disappointment.</span></p><p><span>226.At times, Microsoft has argued that the limitations it imposes on the ability of OEMs to modify Windows originate in a desire to prevent its platform from becoming fragmented, like UNIX.  Microsoft believes that ISVs benefit from the fact that Windows presents the same platform for applications development, irrespective of the underlying hardware.  Certainly, Microsoft has a legitimate interest in ensuring that OEMs do not take Windows under license, alter its API set, and then ship the altered version.  This fact does not add credibility to Microsoft’s stated justification, though, for two reasons.  First, Microsoft itself creates some degree of instability in its supposedly uniform platform by releasing updates to Internet Explorer more frequently than it releases new versions of Windows.  As things stand, ISVs find it necessary to redistribute Microsoft’s Internet-related APIs with their applications because of nonuniformity that Microsoft has created in its own installed base.  More important, however, is the fact that none of the modifications that OEMs are known to have proposed making would have removed or altered any Windows APIs.</span></p><p><span>227.To the extent Microsoft is apprehensive that OEMs might, absent restrictions, change the set of APIs exposed by the software on their PCs, the concern is not that OEMs would modify the Windows API set.  Rather, the worry is that OEMs would pre-install, on top of Windows, other software exposing additional APIs not controlled by Microsoft.  In the case of alternate user interfaces, Microsoft is fearful that, if these programs loaded automatically the first time users turned on their PCs, the programs would attract so much usage that developers would be encouraged to take advantage of any APIs that the programs exposed.  Indeed, one user interface in particular that OEMs could configure to load automatically and obscure the Windows desktop — Navigator — exposes a substantial number of APIs.  Therefore, Microsoft’s real concern has not been that OEM modifications would fragment the Windows platform to the detriment of developers and consumers.  What has motivated Microsoft’s prohibition against automatically loading shells is rather the fear — once again — that OEMs would pre-install and give prominent placement to middleware that could weaken the applications barrier to entry.</span></p><p><span>228.Like most other software products, Windows 95 and Windows 98 are covered by copyright registrations.  Since they are copyrighted, Microsoft distributes these products to OEMs pursuant to license agreements.  By early 1998, Microsoft had made these licenses conditional on OEMs’ compliance with the restrictions described above.  Notwithstanding the formal inclusion of these restrictions in the license agreements, the removal of the Internet Explorer icon and the promotion of Navigator in the boot sequence would not have compromised Microsoft’s creative expression or interfered with its ability to reap the legitimate value of its ingenuity and investment in developing Windows.  More generally, the contemporaneous Microsoft documents reflect concern with the promotion of Navigator rather than the infringement of a copyright.  Also notable is the fact that Microsoft did not adjust its OEM pricing guidelines when it lifted certain of the restrictions in the spring of 1998.</span></p><p><span>229.Finally, it is significant that, while all vendors of PC operating systems undoubtedly share Microsoft’s stated interest in maximizing consumer satisfaction, the prohibitions that Microsoft imposes on OEMs are considerably more restrictive than those imposed by other operating system vendors.  For example, Apple allows its retailers to remove applications that Apple has pre-installed and to reconfigure the Mac OS desktop.  For its part, IBM allows its OEM licensees to override the entire OS/2 desktop in favor of a customized shell or to set an application to start automatically the first time the PC is turned on.  The reason is that these firms do not share Microsoft’s interest in protecting the applications barrier to entry.</span></p><p><span>b.Pressuring OEMs to Promote Internet Explorer and to not Pre-</span></p><p><span>Install or Promote Navigator</span></p><p><span>230.Microsoft’s restrictions on modifications to the boot sequence and the configuration of the Windows desktop ensured that every Windows user would be presented with ready means of accessing Internet Explorer.  Although the restrictions also raised the costs attendant to pre-installing and promoting Navigator, senior executives at Microsoft were not confident that those higher costs alone would induce all of the major OEMs to focus their promotional efforts on Internet Explorer to the exclusion of Navigator.  Therefore, Microsoft used incentives and threats in an effort to secure the cooperation of individual OEMs.</span></p><p><span>231.First, Microsoft rewarded with valuable consideration those large-volume OEMs that took steps to promote Internet Explorer.  For example, Microsoft gave reductions in the royalty price of Windows to certain OEMs, including Gateway, that set Internet Explorer as the default browser on their PC systems.  In 1997, Microsoft gave still further reductions to those OEMs that displayed Internet Explorer’s logo and links to Microsoft’s Internet Explorer update page on their own home pages.  That same year, Microsoft agreed to give OEMs millions of dollars in co-marketing funds, as well as costly in-kind assistance, in exchange for their carrying out other promotional activities for Internet Explorer.</span></p><p><span>232.Microsoft went beyond giving OEMs incentives to promote Internet Explorer.  The company’s dealings with Compaq in 1996 and 1997 demonstrate that Microsoft was willing to exchange valuable consideration for an OEM’s commitment to curtail its distribution and promotion of Navigator.  In early 1996, at around the same time that Compaq was removing the MSN and Internet Explorer icons and program entries from the Presario desktop, Compaq announced its intention to work with Netscape for its internal Internet needs and on Internet server initiatives.  In response, Microsoft insisted that Compaq support Microsoft’s Internet initiatives throughout its business.  To make its displeasure felt, Microsoft initiated a series of cooperative ventures with some of Compaq’s competitors, including DEC and Hewlett-Packard.</span></p><p><span>233.When Compaq eventually agreed to restore the MSN and Internet Explorer icons and program entries to the Presario desktop, it did so because its senior executives had decided that the firm needed to do what was necessary to restore its special relationship with Microsoft.  On May 13, 1996, Compaq signed an addendum extending the firms’ Frontline Partnership to the realm of network-related products.  Pursuant to the addendum, Compaq agreed to ship Internet Explorer as the default browser product on all of its desktop and server systems, to adopt and promote Internet Explorer internally, and to focus the majority of Compaq’s key network-</span></p><p><span>oriented announcements and marketing activities on Microsoft’s technologies and strategy.  In September of the same year, Compaq agreed to offer Internet Explorer as the preferred browser product for its Internet products and to use two or more of Microsoft’s hypertext markup language (“HTML”) extensions in the home page for each of those products.  Then in February 1997, Compaq committed itself to promote Internet Explorer exclusively for its PC products in exchange for Microsoft’s agreement to pay Compaq a bounty for each user that signed up for Internet access using a Compaq PC.  Despite the view of some within Compaq that the firm’s goal should be “to feature the brand leader Netscape,” Compaq elected not to resume the pre-installation of Navigator on its Presario PCs after it removed the joint Spry/Navigator icon.  In fact, Compaq stopped pre-installing Navigator on all but very small percentage of its PCs.  </span></p><p><span>234.In return for Compaq’s capitulation and revival of its commitment to support Microsoft’s Internet strategy, Microsoft has guaranteed Compaq that the prices it pays for Windows will continue to be significantly lower than the prices paid by other OEMs.  Specifically, the operating system licenses signed by Compaq and Microsoft in March 1998 gave Compaq “[g]uaranteed better” pricing than any other OEM for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT Workstation (versions 4 and 5) until April 2000.  Compaq’s license fee for Windows is so low that other OEMs would still pay substantially more than Compaq even if they qualified for all of the royalty reductions listed in Microsoft’s Market Development Agreements (“MDAs”).  What is more, while Microsoft requires other OEMs to verify actual compliance with particular milestones in order to receive Windows 98 royalty reductions, Microsoft has secretly agreed to provide the full amount of those discounts to Compaq regardless of whether it actually satisfies the specified conditions.</span><span/><span>In addition to a guaranteed most-favorable price on Windows, Compaq has enjoyed free internal use of all Windows products for PCs since March 1998.</span></p><p><span>235.Microsoft’s relations with Compaq beginning in late 1996 illustrate the blandishments that Microsoft is willing to extend to OEMs that ally with it to help it capture browser share.  Microsoft’s relations with Gateway and the IBM PC Company, by contrast, reveal the pressure that Microsoft is willing to apply to OEMs that show reluctance to cooperate on this front.</span></p><p><span>236.In February 1997 a Microsoft account representative told his counterpart at Gateway that Gateway’s use of Navigator on its own corporate network was a serious issue at Microsoft.  He added that Microsoft would not do any co-marketing and sales campaigns with Gateway if the firm appeared to be anything but pro-Microsoft.  If Gateway would replace Navigator with Internet Explorer, Microsoft would compensate Gateway for its investment in Netscape’s product.  If Gateway refused, Microsoft might be compelled to audit Gateway’s internal use of Microsoft products.  Gateway was separately told by Microsoft representatives that its decision to ship Navigator with its PCs could affect its business relationship with Microsoft.  Despite the pressure from Microsoft, Gateway refused to switch its internal use to Internet Explorer or to stop shipping Navigator with its PCs.  Although Microsoft did not implement its more specific threats, Gateway has consistently paid higher prices for Windows than its competitors.  Microsoft’s actions not only corroborate the evidence of its interest in suppressing the usage of Navigator, they also demonstrate its ability to threaten recalcitrant customers without losing their business.</span></p><p><span>237.Similarly, in early 1997, Microsoft tried to convince the IBM PC Company to promote and distribute the upcoming release of its new browser, Internet Explorer 4.0.  At a meeting with IBM executives in March 1997, Microsoft representatives threatened that, if IBM did not pre-load and promote Internet Explorer 4.0 to the exclusion of Navigator on its PCs, it would suffer “MDA repercussions.”  One of the Microsoft representatives in attendance, Bengt Ackerlind, stated that in return for IBM shipping its systems without any software that competed with Microsoft, IBM would receive “soft dollars,” marketing assistance, improved access to the source code of Windows 95 and Microsoft’s BackOffice product, and the ability to self-certify for Microsoft’s Windows Hardware Quality Lab provisions.  In a follow-up meeting three weeks later, Microsoft representatives again insisted that IBM distribute and promote Internet Explorer exclusively and again offered soft dollars, marketing assistance, and MDA reductions in return.  Later that day, in a smaller meeting that Microsoft referred to as “secret discussions,” Ackerlind stated Microsoft’s desire that IBM promote Internet Explorer 4.0 exclusively and warned that if IBM pre-installed Navigator on its PCs, “We have a problem.”</span></p><p><span>238.The IBM PC Company refused to promote Internet Explorer 4.0 exclusively, and it has continued to pre-install Navigator on its PCs.  The difference in the ways that Compaq and IBM responded to Microsoft’s Internet-related overtures in 1996 and 1997 contributed to the stark contrast in the treatment the two firms have since received from Microsoft.</span></p><p><span>d.Effect of Microsoft’s Actions in the OEM Channel</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>239.Microsoft has largely succeeded in exiling Navigator from the crucial OEM distribution channel.  Even though a few OEMs continue to offer Navigator on some of their PCs, Microsoft has caused the number of OEMs offering Navigator, and the number of PCs on which they offer it, to decline dramatically.  Before 1996, Navigator enjoyed a substantial and growing presence on the desktop of new PCs.  Over the next two years, however, Microsoft’s actions forced the number of copies of Navigator distributed through the OEM channel down to an exiguous fraction of what it had been.  By January 1998, Kempin could report to his superiors at Microsoft that, of the sixty OEM sub-channels (15 major OEMs each offering corporate desktop, consumer/small business, notebook, and workstation PCs), Navigator was being shipped through only four.  Furthermore, most of the PCs shipped with Navigator featured the product in a manner much less likely to lead to usage than if its icon appeared on the desktop.  For example, Sony only featured Navigator in a folder rather than on the desktop, and Gateway only shipped Navigator on a separate CD-ROM rather than pre-installed on the hard drive.  By the beginning of January 1999, Navigator was present on the desktop of only a tiny percentage of the PCs that OEMs were shipping. </span></p><p><span>240.To the extent Netscape is still able to distribute Navigator through the OEM channel, Microsoft has substantially increased the cost of that distribution.  Although in January 1999 (in the midst of this trial), Compaq suddenly decided to resume the pre-installation of Navigator on its Presario PCs, Compaq’s reversal came only after Netscape agreed to provide Compaq with approximately $700,000 worth of free advertising.</span></p><p><span>241.In sum, Microsoft successfully secured for Internet Explorer — and foreclosed to Navigator — one of the two distribution channels that leads most efficiently to the usage of browsing software.  Even to the extent that Navigator retains some access to the OEM channel, Microsoft has relegated it to markedly less efficient forms of distribution than the form vouchsafed for Internet Explorer, namely, prominent placement on the Windows desktop.  Microsoft achieved this feat by using a complementary set of tactics.  First, it forced OEMs to take Internet Explorer with Windows and forbade them to remove or obscure it — restrictions which both ensured the prominent presence of Internet Explorer on users’ PC systems and increased the costs attendant to pre-installing and promoting Navigator.  Second, Microsoft imposed additional technical restrictions to increase the cost of promoting Navigator even more.  Third, Microsoft offered OEMs valuable consideration in exchange for commitments to promote Internet Explorer exclusively.  Finally, Microsoft threatened to penalize individual OEMs that insisted on pre-installing and promoting Navigator.  Although Microsoft’s campaign to capture the OEM channel succeeded, it required a massive and multifarious investment by Microsoft; it also stifled innovation by OEMs that might have made Windows PC systems easier to use and more attractive to consumers.  That Microsoft was willing to pay this price demonstrates that its decision-makers believed that maximizing Internet Explorer’s usage share at Navigator’s expense was worth almost any cost.</span></p><p><span>3.Excluding Navigator from the IAP Channel</span></p><p><span>242.By late 1995, Microsoft had identified bundling with the client software of IAPs as the other of the two most efficient channels for distributing browsing software.  By that time, however, several of the most popular IAPs were shipping Navigator.  Recognizing that it was starting from behind, Microsoft devised an aggressive strategy to capture the IAP channel from Netscape.  In February 1996, Cameron Myhrvold, the Microsoft executive in charge of the firm’s relations with ISPs, outlined the strategy in a memorandum to his colleagues and superiors within the company:</span></p><p><span>It’s essential we increase the share of our browser.  Network operators [(IAPs, plus the telephone and cable companies providing Internet access services)] are important distributors and we will license at no cost the Internet Explorer for distribution with their Internet access business to maximize the distribution/adoption of IE as browser of choice.  We will attempt exclusive arrangements, fight for preferred status, but settle for parity with NetScape.  Even offering IE for free will not win us every sale.  In the U.S. we will offer IE broadly to net[work ]op[erator]s and IAPs including the many hundreds of smaller IAPs.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>In the first step of this strategy, Microsoft enticed ISPs with small subscriber bases to distribute Internet Explorer and to make it their default browsing software by offering for free both a license to distribute Internet Explorer and a software kit that made it easy for ISPs with limited resources to adapt Internet Explorer for bundling with their services.</span></p><p><span>243.Those who planned and implemented Microsoft’s IAP campaign believed that, if IAPs gave new subscribers a choice between Internet Explorer and Navigator, most of them would pick Navigator — both because Netscape’s brand had become nearly synonymous with the Web in the public consciousness and because Navigator had developed a much better reputation for quality than Internet Explorer.  To compensate for Navigator’s advantage, Microsoft reinforced its free distribution of Internet Explorer licenses and the access kits with three tactics designed to induce IAPs with large subscriber bases not only to distribute and promote Internet Explorer, but also to constrain severely their distribution and promotion of Navigator and to convert those of their subscribers already using Navigator to Internet Explorer.  </span></p><p><span>244.Microsoft’s first tactic was to develop and include with Windows an Internet sign-</span></p><p><span>up program that made it simple for users to download access software from, and subscribe to, any IAP appearing on a list assembled by Microsoft.  In exchange for their inclusion on this list, the leading IAPs agreed, at Microsoft’s insistence, to distribute and promote Internet Explorer, to refrain from promoting non-Microsoft Web browsing software, and to ensure that they distributed non-Microsoft browsing software to only a limited percentage of their subscribers.  Although the percentages varied by IAP, the most common figure was seventy-five percent. </span></p><p><span>245.In a similar tactic aimed at a more important IAP sub-channel, Microsoft created an “Online Services Folder” and placed an icon for that folder on the Windows desktop.  In exchange for the pre-installation of their access software with Windows and for the inclusion of their icons in the Online Services Folder, the leading OLSs agreed, again at Microsoft’s insistence, to distribute and promote Internet Explorer, to refrain from promoting non-Microsoft Web browsing software, and to distribute non-Microsoft browsing software to no more than fifteen percent of their subscribers.  </span></p><p><span>246.Finally, Microsoft gave IAPs incentives to upgrade the millions of subscribers already using Navigator to proprietary access software that included Internet Explorer.  To IAPs included in the Windows Internet sign-up list, Microsoft offered the incentive of reductions in the referral fees it charged for inclusion in the list.  To OLSs in the Online Services Folder, Microsoft offered cash bounties.</span></p><p><span>247.In sum, Microsoft made substantial sacrifices, including the forfeiture of significant revenue opportunities, in order to induce IAPs to do four things: to distribute access software that came with Internet Explorer; to promote Internet Explorer; to upgrade existing subscribers to Internet Explorer; and to restrict their distribution and promotion of non-Microsoft browsing software.  The restrictions on the freedom of IAPs to distribute and promote Navigator were far broader than they needed to be in order to achieve any economic efficiency.  This is especially true given the fact that Microsoft never expected Internet Explorer to generate any revenue.  Ultimately, the inducements that Microsoft offered IAPs at substantial cost to itself, together with the restrictive conditions it imposed on IAPs, did the four things they were designed to accomplish:  They caused Internet Explorer’s usage share to surge; they caused Navigator’s usage share to plummet; they raised Netscape’s own costs; and they sealed off a major portion of the IAP channel from the prospect of recapture by Navigator.  As an ancillary effect, Microsoft’s campaign to seize the IAP channel significantly hampered the ability of consumers to make their choice of Web browser products based on the features of those products.</span></p><p><span>a.The Internet Explorer Access Kit Agreements</span></p><p><span>248.In September 1996, Microsoft announced the availability of the “Internet Explorer Access Kit,” or “IEAK.”  By simply accessing the correct page on Microsoft’s Web site and clicking on a box to indicate agreement with the license terms, any IAP could download the IEAK, which included a copy of Internet Explorer.  With their technical knowledge, sophisticated equipment, and high-bandwidth connections, IAPs found it very convenient to download Internet Explorer and the IEAK from Microsoft’s Web site.  </span></p><p><span>249.Using the IEAK, an IAP could create a distinctive identity for its service in as little as a few hours by customizing the title bar, icon, start and search pages, and “favorites” in Internet Explorer.  The IEAK also made the installation process easy for IAPs.  With the IEAK, IAPs could avoid piecemeal installation of various programs and instead create an automated, comprehensive installation package in which all settings and options were pre-configured.  In addition to ease of customization and installation, the IEAK enabled each IAP to preset the default home page so that customers would be taken to the IAP’s Web site whenever they logged onto the Internet.  This was important to IAPs because setting the user’s home page to the IAP’s Web site gave the IAPs advertising and promotional opportunities.  Netscape, by contrast, refused to allow its IAP licensees to move Navigator’s home page from Netscape’s NetCenter portal site.</span></p><p><span>250.Many IAPs would have paid for the right to distribute Internet Explorer.  Indeed, Netscape was charging IAPs between fifteen and twenty dollars per copy of Navigator they distributed.  Because of the features and convenience it offered, the IEAK significantly increased the price that IAPs would have been willing to pay.  Nevertheless, Microsoft licensed the IEAK, including Internet Explorer, to IAPs at no charge.  At the time Microsoft released the IEAK, Netscape did not offer IAPs an analogous tool.  Although Netscape eventually followed Microsoft’s lead by introducing a tool kit similar to the IEAK known as Mission Control, that kit was not made available to IAPs until June 1997 — a full nine months after the release of the IEAK.  Whereas IAPs could obtain the IEAK for free, Netscape initially charged $1,995 for each copy of Mission Control.</span></p><p><span>251.Approximately 2,500 IAPs executed an electronic copy of a license agreement for the IEAK.  Included in that number were the eighty IAPs that together accounted for ninety-five percent of all Internet access subscribers in the United States.  The IAPs that executed an IEAK license agreement agreed to make Internet Explorer their “preferred” browsing software.  The term “preferred” was not defined in the license, and Microsoft did not investigate the extent to which Internet Explorer was in fact enjoying “preferred” status in the client software of its IEAK licensees.  In fact, other than to provide information and respond to technical questions, Microsoft made no effort to maintain regular direct contact with the vast majority of the IAPs that had executed licenses.</span></p><p><span>252.Whether or not IEAK licensees actually gave Internet Explorer preferred status, Microsoft’s decision to license Internet Explorer and the IEAK to IAPs at no charge beguiled many small ISPs that otherwise would not have done so into distributing Internet Explorer to their subscribers.  By giving up the opportunity to charge for Internet Explorer, and also by developing the IEAK at substantial cost and offering it at no charge, Microsoft thus increased the flow of Internet Explorer through the crucial IAP channel.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>b.The Referral Server Agreements</span></p><p><span>253.In the late summer of 1996, at around the time that it announced the availability of the IEAK, Microsoft also introduced the Internet Connection Wizard (“ICW”) as a feature in Windows 95 OSR 2.  If a user clicked on the ICW icon appearing on the Windows 95 desktop, the program would automatically dial into a computer maintained by Microsoft called the Windows Referral Server.  The Referral Server would then transmit to the user’s computer a list of IAPs that provided connections to the Internet in the user’s geographic locale.  Included in this list would be information about each IAP’s service, including its prices.  If the user then indicated a desire to sign up for one of the listed IAPs by clicking on the appropriate entry, the user would be connected to an IAP-maintained server that would automatically configure the user’s PC to work properly with the IAP service.</span></p><p><span>254.For several reasons, IAPs viewed inclusion in the Windows 95 Referral Server as a valuable form of promotion.  First, the ICW icon appeared prominently on the desktop of every PC running Windows 95 (from OSR 2 onwards), which, by the middle of 1996, accounted for the vast majority of all new PCs being shipped.  Because Microsoft prohibited OEMs from removing any of the icons that it placed on the Windows desktop, IAPs knew that the ICW would confront all users of Windows 95 PCs the first time they turned on their systems.  Second, inclusion in the Referral Server was a highly focused form of promotion, because the IAP list provided by the Referral Server presented itself to users who had already indicated some interest in signing up for Internet access.  Third, the easy-to-use features of the ICW heightened the probability that a user who started using the program would complete the process of subscribing to an IAP.  Finally, inclusion in the Referral Server was a relatively inexpensive means of distribution because, unlike “carpet bombing” with CD-ROMs, it did not require the production and dissemination of anything tangible.</span></p><p><span>255.Despite the value that IAPs attached to placement in the Windows 95 Referral Server, Microsoft elected to charge those that it granted placement a low bounty price that merely went to pay down the cost of maintaining the necessary server computers and leasing the network they ran on.  Although it could have been exchanged for large bounties from IAPs, Microsoft decided to exchange placement in the Referral Server, along with other valuable consideration, for the agreement of the selected IAPs to promote and distribute Internet Explorer preferentially over Navigator and to convert existing subscribers from Navigator to Internet Explorer.</span></p><p><span>256.Between July 1996 and September 1997, Microsoft entered into Referral Server agreements with fourteen IAPs.  These were AOL, AT&T WorldNet, Brigadoon, Concentric, Digex, EarthLink, GTE, IDT, MCI, MindSpring, Netcom, Prodigy, Sprint, and Spry.  Three of these companies did not take the technical steps necessary to appear in the Referral Server even though they had signed agreements with Microsoft.  Brigadoon failed to take those steps because it filed for bankruptcy.  For its part, Digex left the ISP business to focus exclusively on Web hosting.  GTE, on the other hand, decided to enter promotion agreements directly with OEMs rather than abide by the conditions Microsoft attached to inclusion in the Referral Server.  Although AOL eventually entered a listing into the Referral Server, it waited until November 1998, after the release of Windows 98.  The remaining IAPs in the Windows 95 Referral Server represented ten of the top fifteen Internet access providers in the North America.</span></p><p><span>257.Pursuant to the terms of the agreements it signed with these ten IAPs, Microsoft provided each with a listing in the Windows 95 Referral Server and mentioned them in press releases and marketing activities relating to the ICW.  Microsoft also licensed Internet Explorer to them at no charge, and assisted them in customizing Internet Explorer for use with their services.  In exchange, the listed IAPs agreed to offer Internet Explorer as the “standard,” “default,” or “preferred” browsing software with their services.  For example, Microsoft’s agreement with EarthLink required it to “[o]ffer the Microsoft Internet Explorer as the standard web browser for [EarthLink’s] ISP Service.”  </span></p><p><span>258.The agreements also imposed several restrictions on the ability of the IAPs in the Referral Server to promote and distribute non-Microsoft browsing software.  First, the agreements required the IAPs to limit their promotion of browser products other than Internet Explorer.  For example, the agreements prohibited the IAPs from providing any links or other promotions for Netscape on their services’ home pages.  In fact, an IAP listed in the Referral Server was not permitted, either in its Referral Server entry or elsewhere, to express or imply to its subscribers that they could use a browser other than Internet Explorer with the IAP’s service.  Second, the agreements prohibited the ten IAPs from providing non-Microsoft browsing software to their customers unless a subscriber specifically requested it.  Third, the agreements gave Microsoft the right to remove from the Referral Server any IAP, that in two consecutive calendar quarters, allowed non-Microsoft browsing software to climb above a specific percentage of all browsing software distributed by that IAP.  Thus, even if the IAP ensured that all users subscribing to its service through the Internet Connection Wizard received only Internet Explorer with their subscriptions, Microsoft could nevertheless remove the ISP from the Referral Server if copies of Navigator made up more than the specified percentage of the browsing software that the IAP distributed through all sub-channels.  Twenty-five percent was the figure specified in most of the agreements.  For Netcom and Sprint, the figure was fifty percent, while for IDT it was fifteen.</span></p><p><span>259.In addition to conditioning placement in the Referral Server on an IAP’s undertaking to limit its promotion and distribution of non-Microsoft browsing software, Microsoft through its Referral Server agreements exchanged valuable consideration for the commitment of the ten IAPs to convert existing subscribers from Navigator to Internet Explorer.  Microsoft also compensated them for employing Internet Explorer-specific technologies whose dissemination would encourage the developers of network-centric applications to focus on APIs controlled by Microsoft, as opposed to Netscape or Sun.  For example, in exchange for Netcom’s commitment to offer deals to its customers encouraging them to upgrade their software to the newest version that bundled Internet Explorer, Microsoft subtracted nine dollars from the referral fee.  Microsoft also deposited one dollar into a co-marketing fund for each Netcom subscriber who actually upgraded to client software that bundled Internet Explorer.  </span></p><p><span>260.Where the agreement with Microsoft required the IAP to abandon a distribution agreement already entered with Netscape, Microsoft compensated the IAP with additional consideration.  For instance, in response to a representation from MCI that it had already committed to pay Netscape between five and ten million dollars for Web browsing software, Microsoft agreed to grant MCI a credit of five dollars toward a co-marketing fund (not to exceed five million dollars) for each copy of Internet Explorer that MCI distributed to an MCI Internet access customer who had not already received a copy.  Finally, Microsoft offered yet further reductions in referral fees to the IAPs using Microsoft-controlled technologies likely to stimulate developers to focus their attention on Windows-specific software interfaces rather than the cross-</span></p><p><span>platform ones provided by Netscape and Sun.  For example, Microsoft offered to reduce EarthLink’s per-copy referral fee by ten dollars in exchange for EarthLink’s use of at least two ActiveX controls in the design of its home page and the use of Microsoft FrontPage server extensions on its Web hosting servers.</span></p><p><span>261.Microsoft could have covered the cost of developing and maintaining the ICW and the Windows Referral Server, and even made a profit, by charging higher referral fees than it did to the favored IAPs.  Instead, Microsoft bartered away so much of the referral fees it otherwise could have charged that the costs of running the Windows Referral Server have thus far exceeded the payments Microsoft has received from the favored IAPs.  Microsoft readily made this sacrifice in order to induce the important IAPs to take actions that aided Microsoft’s effort to exclude Navigator from the IAP channel.</span></p><p><span>262.Microsoft’s motivation for the limits it placed on the distribution of non-Microsoft browsing software by IAPs in the Windows 95 Referral Server could not have been simply a desire to ensure that IAPs did not promote competing browsing software to subscribers acquired with Microsoft’s help.  The agreements gave Microsoft the right to dismiss an IAP that either told its subscribers they could choose Navigator or distributed too many copies of non-Microsoft browser products.  This was true even if the IAP never mentioned Navigator in its Referral Server entry and distributed nothing but Internet Explorer to the new subscribers it garnered from the ICW.  In light of that fact, the Windows 95 Referral Server agreements emerge as something very different from typical cross-marketing arrangements.  Furthermore, while facilitating for consumers the process of connecting to the Internet may have been one motivation for developing the Internet Connection Wizard, that motivation cannot explain the exclusionary terms in the Referral Server agreements.  After all, contractually limiting the distribution of non-Microsoft browsing software by IAPs did nothing to help consumers gain easy access to the Internet.  The real motivation behind the exclusionary terms in the Referral Server agreements was Microsoft’s conviction that even if IAPs were compelled to promote and distribute Internet Explorer, the majority of their subscribers would nevertheless elect to use Navigator if the IAPs made it readily available to them.  Microsoft therefore paid a high price to induce the most popular IAPs to encourage their customers to use Internet Explorer and discourage them from using Navigator.</span></p><p><span>263.Absent the conditions Microsoft placed on inclusion in the Referral Server, the IAPs would have had no reason to limit the percentage of subscribers that used one particular browser or another.  As Cameron Myhrvold explained to colleagues within Microsoft in April 1997, “ISPs are agnostic on the browser.  It is against their nature to favor a browser or even a platform.  This has been damn hard for us to influence.”  In fact, Myhrvold told the same colleagues that he “had a hard time guiding the ISPs to IE loyalty even when I make them sign explicit terms and conditions in a legal contract.”</span></p><p><span>264.Microsoft monitored the extent of compliance of IAPs in the Referral Server with the shipment restrictions contained in their agreements.  It did this by periodically asking each of the ten IAPs to send Microsoft estimates of the number of copies of Internet Explorer — and non-Microsoft browsing software — they were shipping.  When, from time to time, various IAPs in the Windows 95 Referral Server (specifically Netcom, Concentric, and EarthLink) fell below the shipment quotas specified in their agreements with Microsoft, executives at Microsoft reacted by contacting the derelict companies and urging them to meet their obligations.  Concentric and Earthlink eventually (by May 1998, if not sooner) reduced their Navigator shipments enough to bring them below the required percentage.  Microsoft never formally removed an IAP from the Referral Server.   For a time after the release of Internet Explorer 4.0, however, no entry for Netcom appeared in the new version of Referral Server.  This was at least in part due to Netcom’s failure to ensure that Internet Explorer accounted for fifty percent of the browsing software it shipped.  </span></p><p><span>265.In addition to failing, for a time, to meet the required shipment quotas, Concentric and EarthLink occasionally promoted Navigator in ways that were arguably prohibited by the Referral Server agreements.  Despite their delinquency, Microsoft never removed Concentric and EarthLink from the Referral Server.  Of much less concern to Microsoft than the shipment and promotion of Navigator by IAPs having signed Referral Server agreements was the fact that Concentric and EarthLink, along with Netcom and three of the other IAPs in the Windows 95 Referral Server, also appeared in Netscape’s referral server.  This did not violate either the letter or the spirit of their agreements with Microsoft, for while the agreements prohibited the IAPs in the Windows 95 Referral Server from promoting Navigator, they did not purport to hinder Netscape in promoting those IAPs.  At any rate, Microsoft did not have reason to be concerned with the appearance of its IAP partners in Netscape’s referral server, whose main exposure was to existing Navigator users interested in switching their IAPs.  A listing in Netscape’s referral server did not help Netscape get its software on users’ systems, and pursuant to their agreements with Microsoft, the six ISPs in both Microsoft’s and Netscape’s referral servers were actually placing Navigator on far fewer users’ systems than they would have in the absence of their agreements with Microsoft.</span></p><p><span>266.In reaction to Microsoft’s Referral Server agreements, Netscape entered into agreements of its own with five of the Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs).  Under the Netscape agreements, the RBOCs agreed to make Navigator their default Web browsing software in all cases, except those in which subscribers affirmatively requested other browsing software.  In exchange, Netscape agreed to list the RBOCs first among the IAPs included in Netscape’s referral server.  In contrast to Microsoft’s agreements, Netscape’s agreements with the RBOCs imposed no restrictions on their ability to distribute other browsing software, such as Internet Explorer, whether in response to customer requests or otherwise.  Furthermore, Netscape’s contracts with the RBOCs required them to set Navigator as the default only so long as AT&T and MCI were both restricted by their agreements with Microsoft from providing Navigator to their customers on par with Internet Explorer.  In any event, the RBOCs currently deliver Internet access to less than five percent of the Internet access subscribers in North America.</span></p><p><span>267.Microsoft’s Windows 95 Referral Server agreements were of relatively short duration.  For example, Microsoft’s agreement with EarthLink provided that it would expire two years from its signing in August 1996 unless either party elected to terminate it sooner, and both Microsoft and EarthLink were free to terminate the agreement for any reason on thirty days’ written notice.  The other Referral Server agreements were similarly short in term. </span></p><p><span>268.In April 1998, coincident with rising public criticism, the impending appearance of Bill Gates before a Congressional panel on competition in the computer industry, and the imminent filing of these lawsuits, Microsoft unilaterally waived the most restrictive provisions in the Windows 95 Referral Server agreements.  Specifically, Microsoft waived the provisions that restricted the IAPs’ ability to distribute non-Microsoft Web browsing software.  With respect to promotion, the revised agreements merely required the IAPs to promote Internet Explorer at least as prominently as they promoted non-Microsoft browsers.  Notably, however, the agreements still required the IAPs to make Internet Explorer their default browser.  </span></p><p><span>269.By the end of September 1998, all of the Windows 95 Referral Server agreements had expired by their own terms.  Microsoft’s Windows 98 Referral Server agreements do not contain any provisions requiring that Internet Explorer make up any particular percentage of the IAPs’ shipments.  Furthermore, the Windows 98 Referral Server agreements offer no discounts on the referral fees predicated on the IAPs’ adoption of any particular Microsoft technology or licensing any Microsoft product.  With regard to promotion, the agreements require only that the IAPs promote Internet Explorer no less favorably than non-Microsoft Web browsing software.  Still, for those IAPs concerned with the costs associated with supporting two browser products, this parity requirement is enough to compel them not to not make Navigator readily available to their subscribers.  The new agreements have a one-year term and are terminable at will by the IAP on ninety days’ notice.</span></p><p><span>270.IAPs no longer value placement in the Windows Referral Server as much as they did in 1996.  For one reason, the ICW has apparently not been responsible for as many new IAP subscriptions as either Microsoft or the IAPs anticipated.  In fact, from the third quarter of 1996 through the third quarter of 1998, only 2.1% of new users of the Internet became IAP subscribers through the Windows Referral Server.  Partially on account of this realization, Microsoft began in the spring of 1998 to surrender significant control over the Internet sign-up process to OEMs.  As described above, Microsoft gave the top fifty OEMs in the world the right to select both the IAPs (up to five) that appear in the Windows 98 Referral Server on the PC systems they sell and to determine the order in which those IAPs appear.  Microsoft also permits the fifty OEMs to keep any bounties that the IAPs pay them for inclusion in the Referral Server.  The OEMs simply pay Microsoft a nominal fee (a flat fee of approximately $10,000 plus thirty cents per subscriber) to defray the costs of operating the Referral Server program.  Furthermore (as is also discussed above), Microsoft has allowed seven of the highest-volume OEMs to supplant the ICW altogether.  </span></p><p><span>271.By both lifting restrictions in its agreements and ceding control over the IAP sign-</span></p><p><span>up process to OEMs, in the spring of 1998, Microsoft relaxed the strictures that it had imposed in the fall of 1996 on the distribution and promotion of Web browsing software by the most popular IAPs.  In the year-and-a-half that they were in full force, however, the restrictive terms in the Referral Server agreements induced the major IAPs to customize their client software for Internet Explorer, gear their promotional and marketing activities to Microsoft’s technologies, and convert substantial portions of their installed bases from Navigator to Internet Explorer.  They may have welcomed more flexibility to distribute Navigator to those subscribers that expressed demand for it, but they had no incentive to launch an expensive campaign to reverse the tide that Microsoft’s restrictions had already generated.  Consequently, few ISPs have responded to Microsoft’s contractual dispensations by increasing significantly their distribution and promotion of Navigator.  Furthermore, one of the reasons Microsoft felt comfortable relaxing the controls on IAPs in the spring of 1998 was that it had achieved — and planned to maintain — control over the distribution and promotion of Web browsing software by AOL and the other major OLSs, whose combined subscriber base comprised most of North America’s Internet users.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>c.The Online Services Folder Agreements</span></p><p><span> 272.In late 1995 and early 1996, senior executives at Microsoft recognized that AOL accounted for a substantial portion of all existing Internet access subscriptions and that it attracted a very large percentage of new IAP subscribers.  Indeed, AOL was and is the largest and most important IAP.  The Microsoft executives thus realized that if they could convince AOL to distribute Internet Explorer with its client software instead of Navigator, Microsoft would — in a single coup — capture a large part of the IAP channel for Internet Explorer.  In the early spring of 1996, therefore, Microsoft exchanged favorable placement on the Windows desktop, as well as other valuable consideration, for AOL’s commitment to distribute and promote Internet Explorer to the near exclusion of Navigator.  AOL’s acceptance of this arrangement has caused an enormous surge in Internet Explorer’s usage share and a concomitant decline in Navigator’s share.  To supplement the effects of the AOL deal, Microsoft entered similar agreements with other OLSs.  The importance of these arrangements to Microsoft is evident in the fact that, in contrast to the restrictive terms in the Windows Referral Server agreements, Microsoft has never waived the terms that require the OLSs to distribute and promote Internet Explorer to the near exclusion of Navigator.</span></p><p><span>i.AOL</span></p><p><span>273.Prior to 1995, OLS subscribers used proprietary access software to view only their OLS’s specialized content.  Beginning in 1994, however, the public became increasingly interested in accessing information on the Web.  So to keep from losing subscribers and to attract new ones, OLSs upgraded their services to provide access to the Web.  In November 1994, for example, AOL purchased BookLink and incorporated its Web browsing software into AOL’s proprietary access software to enable AOL’s subscribers to access and view Web content.</span></p><p><span>274.While public awareness of the Web was taking hold, companies like Netscape and Microsoft were hard at work developing Web browsing software.  By the fall of 1995, a number of OLSs, including AOL, had decided not to devote the considerable resources that would have been required to keep up with this rapid pace of innovation.  They chose instead to license state-</span></p><p><span>of-the-art Web browsing technology from a separate supplier.  Microsoft saw AOL, with its subscriber base then approaching five million, as a potential breakthrough opportunity — a way for Microsoft quickly to obtain credibility in Web browsing technology as well as usage share for the current version of its browsing software, Internet Explorer 3.0.</span></p><p><span>275.In November 1995, David Cole of AOL advised Pete Higgins of Microsoft that AOL was looking for Web browsing software to license and incorporate into future versions of its proprietary access software.  Bill Gates and AOL’s Chairman, Steve Case, subsequently spoke several times on the telephone.  In those conversations, Gates urged that AOL representatives meet with Microsoft technical personnel in order to get a better sense of the quality and features of Internet Explorer 3.0.  For his part, Case told Gates that he wanted Microsoft to include AOL’s client software with Windows such that AOL received the same desktop promotion that MSN enjoyed.  Gates insisted that such favorable treatment of AOL within Windows was out of the question.</span></p><p><span>276.Lower down in Microsoft’s chain of command, executives took issue with Gates’ reluctance to grant AOL favorable placement in Windows.  In October 1995, before Gates and Case began talking, a group of Microsoft executives prepared for Gates a memorandum on the company’s Internet Explorer efforts entitled, “How to Get to 30% Share in 12 Months.”  The executives wrote that </span></p><p><span>we need to remove barriers to browser adoption by Online Services and Internet Access Providers.  Today MSN is an access service . . . , an online service . . . , and an Internet site . . . ; in other words, it competes with everyone.  By bundling MSN in the Windows box, we are threatening ISV’s in each of these areas, who in turn have no incentive to promote our Internet Browser.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>277.One of the proposals the executives put forward was that Microsoft “Open Up the Windows Box.”  In other words, the executives believed that, in exchange for favorable treatment of Internet Explorer, Microsoft should include the client software of IAPs in Windows and give those services prominent placement on the desktop, even if such placement drew attention away from MSN.  Over the months that followed, senior Microsoft executives came to the conclusion that opening up the Windows box to MSN’s competitors was a necessary price to pay for increasing Internet Explorer’s share of browser usage.</span></p><p><span>278.Case ultimately agreed to visit Microsoft’s Redmond campus in January 1996.  In preparation for that meeting, Microsoft purchased PC systems from five different OEMs (Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Packard Bell, and NEC) at retail outlet stores.  When they turned these systems on, employees at Microsoft discovered that the OEMs were already shipping AOL’s software pre-installed on their PCs and giving the AOL service more prominent placement than MSN on the Windows desktop.  From the fact that AOL was already enjoying broad distribution and promotion on the Windows desktop through agreements with OEMs, several senior Microsoft executives, in particular Paul Maritz and Brad Chase, concluded that Microsoft would not be giving up all that much if it traded placement on the Windows desktop for AOL’s commitment to promote and distribute Internet Explorer.  At least initially, Gates took a different lesson from the experiment with the five PC systems.  He seems to have felt that Microsoft should react not by ‘opening up the Windows box,’ but rather by clamping down on the ability of OEMs to configure the Windows desktop.  Indeed, the discovery that OEMs were promoting AOL on the Windows desktop was one of the things that led him to complain to Joachim Kempin on January 6, 1996 about OEMs that were bundling non-Microsoft Internet services and software and displaying it on their PCs “in a FAR more prominent way than MSN or our Internet browser.”</span></p><p><span>279.Case’s insistence that Microsoft promote AOL on the Windows desktop stemmed partly from factors other than the additional subscriptions expected to come from the OLS folder.  After all, AOL already enjoyed distribution agreements with major OEMs that placed an AOL icon on the desktop of millions of new PC systems.  But given that its OEM agreements tended to be short-term and somewhat tenuous, and considering how sensitive the OEMs were to Microsoft’s will, AOL executives realized that AOL’s position on the Windows desktop would be more secure if it met with some degree of contractual acquiescence from Microsoft.  After all, whereas Microsoft retaliated in subtle and not-so-subtle ways against OEMs, such as IBM, that pre-installed software on their PCs that Microsoft found minatory, it pronounced more extreme sanctions against OEMs, such as Compaq, that had the temerity to remove icons and program entries from the Windows desktop that Microsoft had placed there.  Case had reason to see value, then, in shifting AOL from being a source of software at whose promotion Microsoft took umbrage to the dispenser of software whose placement on the Windows desktop Microsoft guaranteed.  Moreover, obtaining Microsoft’s commitment to include the AOL client software and prominent promotion for AOL in every copy of Windows would place AOL on all Windows 95 PC systems, including those sold by the multitude of OEMs whose shipment volumes were too low to warrant the negotiation of separate distribution deals.  Furthermore, placement on the desktop in some fashion would improve AOL’s negotiating position when it asked individual large OEMs to place an AOL icon directly on the desktop of their PC systems.  Whatever the reason, and irrespective of the considerable value that Microsoft offered AOL apart from desktop placement, Case made clear to Gates his sincere conviction that AOL would not recruit its subscribers to Internet Explorer unless Microsoft included AOL’s client software in Windows and promoted AOL in some form on the Windows desktop.  </span></p><p><span>280.Four days before Case was due to arrive at Microsoft’s campus, Gates sent an E-</span></p><p><span>mail outlining Microsoft’s goals in negotiating a deal with AOL to the responsible Microsoft executives.  He wrote:</span></p><p><span>What we want from AOL is that for a period of time — say 2 years — the browser that they give out to their customers and the one they mention and put on their pages and the one they exploit is ours and not Netscape[’]s.  We need for them to make our browser available as the browser to existing and new customers.  We have to be sure that we don’t allow them to promote Netscape as well.  We want all the hits that come off of AOL to register on servers as our browser so people can start seeing us as having measurable browser share.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>Gates understood that if AOL gave assurance that its subscribers used Internet Explorer when browsing the Web, the measure of browser usage share data to which application developers paid most attention — </span><span>i.e.</span><span>, server “hit” data — would show a significant rise in Internet Explorer’s usage share.  Gates also realized that such a commitment by AOL was worth seeking even if it lasted for only a couple of years.</span></p><p><span>281.On January 18, 1996, Case arrived at Microsoft’s campus with three other AOL executives.  During the first meeting, Microsoft described the componentized architecture of Internet Explorer 3.0 that would allow AOL to embed the browsing software into AOL’s access software.  The AOL executives viewed componentization as a highly attractive feature, because AOL wanted its subscribers to feel they were using an AOL service whether they were viewing proprietary AOL content or browsing content on the Web.  In fact, Case and the other AOL representatives told their Microsoft hosts that AOL wanted total control over the “browser frame” (the windows in which Web content is displayed) to make it distinctive to AOL.  In other words, AOL wanted no menus, dialog boxes, or other visible signs that would alert AOL users to the fact that they were using Web browsing software supplied by a company other than AOL. </span></p><p><span>282.At the end of the meeting, Case expressly acknowledged the attractiveness of Microsoft’s componentized approach.  Notably, Netscape had not yet developed a componentized version of Navigator.  Netscape had assured AOL that it would do so, and AOL believed that Netscape was capable of eventually making good on its pledge, but the fact remained that Microsoft had already completed a componentized version of Internet Explorer.  Case was impressed enough with Internet Explorer 3.0 that when he returned to AOL he told a number of fellow executives that, when it came to AOL’s technical considerations, Microsoft perhaps enjoyed an edge over Netscape.  Still, the AOL executives saw Navigator as enjoying better brand recognition and demonstrated success in the marketplace.</span></p><p><span>283.Later in the day on January 18, Case and his team also met with Gates, Chase, and Chase’s direct superior, Brad Silverberg, to discuss the business aspects of a potential AOL-</span></p><p><span>Microsoft alliance.  At one point during the meeting, Case again told Gates that AOL needed inclusion of its client software in Windows and prominent placement on the Windows desktop if there was to be a closer relationship between the two companies.  Gates expressed frustration that Case continued to insist on getting an AOL icon on the Windows desktop in addition to the technology, engineering assistance, and technical support Microsoft was offering AOL.  Despite the obvious importance that Case attached to desktop placement, Gates said he would not agree to that condition.</span></p><p><span>284.A week after the January 18 meeting, Chase and Silverberg met with Gates.  They reiterated that, whether Gates liked it or not, an AOL icon already appeared on the desktop of the major OEMs’ PCs.  Given that </span><span>fait</span><span/><span>accompli</span><span>, they argued, Microsoft would gain much more than it would lose by agreeing to place AOL on the Windows desktop in exchange for AOL’s commitment to promote and distribute Internet Explorer.  This time, Gates agreed to give AOL some sort of promotion in Windows.  He continued to insist, however, that Microsoft not place an AOL icon directly on the Windows desktop.  Rather, Gates agreed to include AOL, along with other OLSs, in a generic “Online Services Folder,” an icon for which would reside on the desktop.  Since MSN enjoyed a branded icon directly on the desktop, including AOL in the OLS folder would maintain its inferior status to Microsoft’s service.</span></p><p><span>285.Still, Gates viewed the concession as a significant one; he understood that it meant undermining MSN’s success in the pursuit of browser share.  As he told an interviewer in the spring of 1996:</span></p><p><span>We have had three options for how to use the “Windows Box”: First, we can use it for the browser battle, recognizing that our core assets are at risk.  Second, we could monetize the box, and sell the real estate to the highest bidder.  Or third, we could use the box to sell and promote internally content assets.  I recognize that, by choosing to do the first, we have leveled the playing field and reduced our opportunities for competitive advantage with MSN.</span></p><p><span>286.In light of AOL’s success in having gained access to the Windows desktop through the expedient of OEM pre-installation without Microsoft’s acquiescence, Gates’ abiding reluctance to grant AOL access through Microsoft’s front door may have stemmed from a preoccupation with the message such a move would send — both to other firms in the computer industry and to consumers deciding which Internet service to use.   Although Gates viewed it as a significant concession, he acquiesced in granting AOL a place in Windows because he believed that Microsoft could not pass up the opportunity AOL presented to drive Internet Explorer’s usage share dramatically upward and to exclude Navigator from a substantial part of the IAP distribution channel.</span></p><p><span>287.The negotiations between Microsoft and AOL proceeded throughout February and early March 1996.  On March 11, 1996, AOL announced that it had selected Navigator as the primary Web browsing software for GNN, which was AOL’s basic ISP service at the time and had a subscriber base only two to three percent the size of the subscriber base of AOL’s flagship online service.  The GNN arrangement was thus eclipsed the following day when AOL announced that it had chosen Internet Explorer as the primary Web browsing software for its flagship service.</span></p><p><span>288.Under the March 12 agreement, Microsoft gave AOL access to, and the right to modify, Internet Explorer source code in order to customize it for use with AOL’s proprietary access software.  This concession went far beyond the freedom that the IEAK granted IAPs to place their own branding on Internet Explorer.  Microsoft also agreed to provide AOL with significant engineering assistance and technical support to enable AOL to integrate Internet Explorer into AOL’s proprietary access software.  Further, Microsoft agreed to provide AOL with certain specific features of Internet Explorer 3.0 by precise target dates and to ensure that future versions of its Web browsing software would possess the latest available Internet-related technology features, capabilities, and standards.  Finally, Microsoft granted AOL free world-wide distribution rights to Internet Explorer and agreed to distribute AOL’s proprietary access software in Windows and to place an AOL icon in the OLS folder on the Windows desktop.</span></p><p><span>289.In return for Microsoft’s commitments, AOL agreed to base the proprietary access software of its flagship online service for Windows and the Mac OS on Internet Explorer 3.0 and to update that software as newer versions of Internet Explorer were released.  Another provision in the agreement provided that “AOL and AOL Affiliates will, with respect to Third Party Browsers, exclusively promote, market and distribute, and have promoted, marketed and distributed, Internet Explorer on or for use by subscribers to the AOL Flagship Service.”  Specifically, AOL agreed to ensure that in successive six-month periods, neither the number of copies of non-Microsoft Web browsing software it shipped (through any sub-channel, including GNN), nor the number of new subscribers accessing AOL (including GNN) with non-Microsoft Web browsing software, would exceed fifteen percent of the total number of copies of proprietary access software that AOL distributed through any channel (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, through the Windows desktop or otherwise).  AOL retained the right to distribute non-Microsoft Web browsing software to subscribers who affirmatively requested it, as long as doing so did not did not raise the relevant shipment quotients above fifteen percent.  AOL also retained the right to provide a link within its service through which its subscribers could reach a Web site from which they could download a version of Navigator customized for the AOL service.  At the same time, however, the agreement prohibited AOL from expressing or implying to subscribers or prospective subscribers that they could use Navigator with AOL.  Nor did it allow AOL to include, on its default page or anywhere else, instructions telling subscribers how to reach the Navigator download site.  In any event, as the Court has found above, downloading large programs over the Internet involves considerable time, and frequently some frustration, for the average user with average hardware and an analog connection.  The prospects were slim that many AOL users (who tend to be novice users with average equipment) would expend the effort to download Navigator when they already had browsing software that worked well with the AOL service.  Finally, while the agreement permitted AOL (subject again to the fifteen-percent shipment quotas) to distribute non-Microsoft Web browsing software when requested by third-party providers, distributors, and corporate accounts, it obligated AOL to use all reasonable efforts to cause the third party to distribute that software on its own and to minimize the use of AOL’s brand name with the distribution.</span></p><p><span>290.The Microsoft executives responsible for closing the deal with AOL recognized that AOL had agreed to distribute and promote Internet Explorer to the virtual exclusion of Navigator.  Two days after Microsoft signed the agreement with AOL, Chase sent to Microsoft’s executive staff a memorandum answering questions he thought the executives might have about the agreement.  One such question was, “I find it hard to believe that AOL is using Internet Explorer as its browser.  Are there exceptions?”  Chase responded: “Yes the[re] are some but they are pretty remote.  An AOL customer could choose to use Navigator and it will be available to be downloaded from the AOL site, though not in a prominent way.  There are some circumstances with 3</span><span>rd</span><span> party distribution deals where AOL has some limited flexibility.  On its GNN service, AOL can do what it wants.  But for all intents and purposes it is true, AOL will be moving its 5M customers to a new client integrated with Internet Explorer 3 starting this summer/fall.”</span></p><p><span>291.As with the restrictive provisions in the Referral Server agreements, the provisions in the March 1996 agreement constraining AOL’s distribution and promotion of Navigator had no purpose other than maximizing Internet Explorer’s usage share at Navigator’s expense.  Considering that the restrictions applied to AOL’s proprietary access software regardless of the sub-channel through which it was distributed, and that Microsoft collected no revenue from Internet Explorer, the restrictions accomplished no efficiency.  They affected consumers only by encumbering their ability to choose between competing browsing technologies.  In order to gain AOL’s acceptance of these restrictions, Microsoft accorded AOL free desktop placement that undermined its own MSN, in which Microsoft had invested hundreds of millions of dollars.  Significantly, Microsoft did not waive any of the terms of its agreement with AOL (nor of its agreements with other OLSs) when it waived some of the restrictive provisions in its Referral Server agreements in April 1998.  The reason was Microsoft’s recognition that holding OLSs, particularly AOL, to exclusive distribution and promotion terms was more important to maximizing Internet Explorer’s usage share than holding ISPs to similar terms.</span></p><p><span>292.Microsoft closely monitored AOL’s compliance with the restrictive provisions in the March 1996 agreement.  Microsoft employees periodically inspected AOL’s service for any sign of promotions for Netscape.  The scrutiny was close enough to prompt an AOL executive to write Microsoft’s Chase: “We are not selling NS advertising around its browser or otherwise — let’s move on. . . . [I]t is not time to be paranoid . . . .”</span></p><p><span>293.Ever since the negotiations with Microsoft intensified in early 1996, it had been AOL’s intention to select one firm’s Web browsing software and then to work closely with that firm to incorporate its browsing technology seamlessly into the AOL flagship client software.  Regardless of which software it chose as its primary offering, though, AOL still wanted the ability to satisfy consumer demand for competing Web browsing software.  AOL did not want users who preferred a certain brand of Web browsing software to have to go to a competing OLS in order to obtain it.  Therefore, even once it selected Internet Explorer as the software that it would integrate seamlessly into its client, AOL would have preferred to make an AOL-configured version of Navigator readily available to subscribers and potential subscribers.  </span></p><p><span>294.Despite its preference, however, AOL did not make Navigator readily available to subscribers after the agreement with Microsoft took effect.  To the contrary, AOL made it relatively difficult for new subscribers to obtain a version of Navigator that would work with its client software, and it pressured existing subscribers who used Navigator to abandon it in favor of client software that included Internet Explorer.  In essence, AOL contravened its natural inclination to respond to consumer demand in order to obtain the free technology, close technical support, and desktop placement offered by Microsoft.</span></p><p><span>295.On October 28, 1996, Microsoft and AOL entered into an additional agreement called the Promotional Services Agreement, whereby AOL agreed to promote its new proprietary access software that included Internet Explorer to existing AOL subscribers, and Microsoft agreed to pay AOL for such promotion based on results.  Specifically, Microsoft agreed to pay AOL $500,000, plus twenty-five cents (up to one million dollars) for each subscriber who upgraded from older versions of AOL’s proprietary access software to the version that included Internet Explorer, plus $600,000 if AOL succeeded in upgrading 5.25 million subscribers by April 1997.  In addition, AOL’s Referral Server agreement with Microsoft provided that AOL would receive a two-dollar credit on referral fees for each new subscriber who used Internet Explorer.  So while the March 12, 1996 agreement ensured that nearly all new AOL subscribers would use Internet Explorer, the Promotional Services and Referral Server agreements enlisted AOL in the effort to convert the OLS’s millions of existing subscribers to Internet Explorer.  In fulfillment of these agreements, AOL began to prompt its subscribers to download the latest version of its client access software, complete with Internet Explorer, every time they logged off the service.</span></p><p><span>296.It is not surprising, given the terms of the 1996 agreements between Microsoft and AOL, that the percentage of AOL subscribers using a version of the client software that included Internet Explorer climbed steeply throughout 1997.  By January 1998, Cameron Myhrvold was able to report to Gates and the rest of Microsoft’s executive committee that ninety-two percent of AOL’s subscribers (who by then numbered over ten million) were using client access software that included Internet Explorer.  A year earlier, the same type of data had shown that only thirty-</span></p><p><span>four percent of AOL subscribers were using AOL client software that included Internet Explorer.  The marked increase resulted in no small part from AOL’s efforts to convert its existing subscribers to the newest version of its client software.  </span></p><p><span>297.Even if an AOL subscriber obtains the new client software that includes Internet Explorer, he can still browse the Web using any browsing software, including Navigator, that happened to be installed on his hard drive.  It is unlikely that many users will go to this effort, however, given the ease of browsing with the software that comes with AOL’s client software.  The average AOL user, being perhaps less technically sophisticated than the average IAP subscriber, is particularly unlikely to expend any effort to use browsing software other than that which comes included with the AOL software.  AOL, acting pursuant to the provisions of the March 1996 agreement, has not made it easy for its subscribers to locate, download, and install a version of Navigator configured for its service.  Consequently, those AOL subscribers who did not already have Navigator on their systems by the time that agreement took effect were even less likely to use Navigator.  </span></p><p><span>298.So when Microsoft executives learned that ninety-two percent of AOL subscribers were using client software that included Internet Explorer, they could rest assured that virtually the same percentage of AOL’s subscribers were using Internet Explorer whenever they connected to the Internet with AOL.  In fact, an examination of the “hit” data collected by AdKnowledge indicates that as of early 1999, only twelve percent of AOL subscribers were using Navigator when they browsed the Web (</span><span>see</span><span> Section V.H.1., </span><span>infra</span><span>, for a description of the method by which AdKnowledge collects data).  AOL (and its CompuServe subsidiary), in turn, accounted for a very large percentage of all IAP subscribers.  In fact, according to data Microsoft collected and used internally, AOL and CompuServe accounted for sixty-five percent of the combined subscriber base of the top eighty IAPs in late 1997.  It is thus a reasonable deduction that the restrictive terms Microsoft induced AOL to accept in 1996 pre-empted a substantial part of the IAP channel for Internet Explorer.</span></p><p><span>299.On November 24, 1998, AOL and Netscape agreed that AOL would acquire Netscape for 4.3 billion dollars’ worth of AOL stock.  In a related transaction, AOL entered into a three-year strategic alliance with Sun, pursuant to which Sun would develop and market both its and Netscape’s server software and would manage the companies’ joint efforts in the area of electronic commerce.  AOL purchased Netscape not just for its browsing technology, but also for its electronic commerce business, its portal site, its brand recognition, and its talented work force.  To the extent AOL was paying for Netscape’s browser business, its primary goal was not to compete for user share against Internet Explorer.  Rather, AOL was interested in Navigator to the extent that it drove Web traffic to Netscape’s popular portal site, NetCenter.  AOL was also interested in ensuring that an alternative to Internet Explorer remained viable; it wanted the option of dropping Internet Explorer to retain enough vitality so that it would not be at the mercy of Microsoft for software upon which the success of its online service largely depended.  Finally, AOL was interested in keeping Navigator alive in order to ensure that Microsoft did not gain total control over Internet standards.</span></p><p><span>300.AOL had the right under its agreement with Microsoft to terminate the distribution and promotion provisions relating to Internet Explorer on December 31, 1998.  If AOL had decided to terminate those provisions, the March 1996 agreement would otherwise have remained in effect, and AOL could have continued to base its proprietary access software on Internet Explorer, taking advantage of Microsoft’s engineering and technical support.  Microsoft, however, would have had the option of removing AOL from the OLS folder.  What is more, Chase informed AOL that Microsoft might react to AOL’s termination of the restrictive provisions by discontinuing the OLS folder altogether, which would have disadvantaged the AOL’s subsidiary OLS, CompuServe, which also enjoyed a place in the OLS folder.  </span></p><p><span>301.Despite its acquisition of Netscape, AOL did not exercise its right to terminate the exclusivity provisions of its agreement with Microsoft at the end of 1998.  AOL executives made the reasons clear to AOL’s board of directors on November 17, 1998, when they presented the Netscape/Sun transactions for the board’s approval.  They wrote:</span></p><p><span>In exchange for using IE as our primary browser component, Microsoft bundles [AOL] in the “Online Services Folder” on the Windows desktop.  This is an important, valued source of new customers for us, and therefore something we are inclined to continue.  Microsoft has made it clear that they will not continue to include us in Windows if we don’t agree to continue our “virtual exclusivity” provisions for use of IE within [AOL]. . . . There are benefits to [Netscape] of replacing IE with the [Netscape] browser — it would dramatically shift browser market share (from about 50/50 today to 65/35 in favor of [Netscape]).  However, our present intent is to continue with IE, partly to get the continued marketing benefits of Windows bundling, and partly to maximize the likelihood of continued “détente” with Microsoft.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>By not exercising its right to terminate the “virtual exclusivity” provisions in the agreement with Microsoft, AOL commited itself to abide by those restrictions until January 1, 2001. </span></p><p><span>302.AOL does not believe that it must make every possible use of Netscape’s browsing software, and maximize Navigator’s usage share, in order to justify its purchase of Netscape.  Now that AOL has the capability to produce its own state-of-the-art componentized browsing software, however, the fact remains that, of the various advantages Microsoft currently offers AOL in exchange for its agreement to distribute and promote Internet Explorer with near exclusivity, the only one likely to still be of great value to AOL at the beginning of the new millennium is the inclusion of AOL’s client software, and the promotion of its service, within Windows.  Assuming Microsoft continues to offer that placement to AOL after January 1, 2001, the extent to which AOL continues to distribute and promote Internet Explorer to the exclusion of other browsing software will depend largely on the value that AOL assigns to that placement and to any new forms of consideration Microsoft offers.  With respect to the value of placement in the OLS folder, AOL registered approximately 970,000 new subscribers through the OLS folder in the fiscal year ending in June 1998.  This represented eleven percent of the new subscriptions AOL gained that year, and it was enough to prompt AOL executives in November 1998 to describe the OLS folder to the AOL board as an “important, valued source of new customers for us.”</span></p><p><span>303.If AOL were to halt its distribution and promotion of Internet Explorer, the effect on Internet Explorer’s usage share would be significant, for AOL’s subscribers currently account for over one third of Internet Explorer’s installed base.  But even if AOL stops distributing Internet Explorer after January 1, 2001 and updates its entire subscriber base to client software that includes its own or some other proprietary browsing software, Microsoft will still have ensured that, over the preceding four years (AOL subscribers began using proprietary access software based on Internet Explorer in November 1996), a very large majority of AOL subscribers used Internet Explorer whenever they browsed the Web through the AOL service.  This period is significantly longer than the two years Gates thought AOL’s obligations would have to last in order for the deal to be worthwhile to Microsoft.</span></p><p><span>304.AOL’s subscribers now number sixteen million, and a substantial part of all Web browsing is done through AOL’s service.  By granting AOL valuable desktop real estate (to MSN’s detriment) and other valuable consideration, Microsoft succeeded in capturing for Internet Explorer, and holding for a minimum of four years, one of the single most important channels for the distribution of browsing software.  Starting the day Microsoft announced the March 1996 agreement with AOL, and lasting at least until AOL announced its acquisition of Netscape in November 1998, developers had reason to look into the foreseeable future and see that non-</span></p><p><span>Microsoft software would not attain stature as the standard platform for network-centric applications.  Microsoft exploited that interval to enhance dependence among developers on Microsoft’s proprietary interfaces for network-centric applications — dependence that will continue to inure to Microsoft’s benefit even if AOL stops distributing Internet Explorer in the future.  The AOL coup, which Microsoft accomplished only at tremendous expense to itself and considerable deprivation of consumers’ freedom of choice, thus contributed to extinguishing the threat that Navigator posed to the applications barrier to entry.</span></p><p><span>ii.Other Online Services</span></p><p><span>305.In the summer and fall of 1996, Microsoft entered into agreements with three other OLSs, namely, AT&T WorldNet, Prodigy, and AOL’s subsidiary, CompuServe.  The provisions of these agreements were substantially the same as those contained in the March 1996 agreement between Microsoft and AOL.  As with the AOL agreement, Microsoft did not deign to waive the restrictive terms in these OLS agreements when it waived similar terms in the Referral Server agreements in the spring of 1998.  The OLSs were discontented with the provisions that limited their ability to distribute and promote non-Microsoft browsing software.  Prodigy, for one, found those provisions objectionable and tried, unsuccessfully, to convince Microsoft to make the terms less restrictive.  AT&T WorldNet’s negotiator also told his Microsoft counterpart, Brad Silverberg, that AT&T wanted to remain neutral as to browsing software.  Despite their reservations, the OLSs accepted Microsoft’s terms because they saw placement in the OLS folder as crucial, and Microsoft made clear that it would only accord such placement to OLSs that agreed to give Internet Explorer exclusive, or at least extremely preferential, treatment.  As one Microsoft negotiator reported to Chase about AT&T WorldNet, “It’s very clear that they really really want to be in the Windows box.”  The OLSs became even more desperate for inclusion in the OLS folder once it was announced that their largest competitor, AOL, had already won placement there.  One Prodigy executive wrote to another two weeks after his company signed the agreement with Microsoft, “it was absolutely critical to Prodigy’s business” and “essential in order to remain competitive” that Prodigy obtain Microsoft’s agreement to include the Prodigy Internet service icon in the OLS folder.</span></p><p><span>306.Although none of these OLSs possessed subscriber bases approaching AOL’s, they comprised, along with MSN, the most significant OLSs other than AOL.  By making arrangements with them similar to the one it enjoyed with AOL, Microsoft ensured that, for as long as the agreements remained in effect, the overwhelming majority of OLS subscribers would use Internet Explorer whenever they accessed the Internet.  Since AOL owns CompuServe, the acquisition of Netscape may affect CompuServe’s arrangement with Microsoft in the future; however, the acquisition does not alter the incentives for the other OLSs to enter new agreements with Microsoft similar to the ones signed in 1996.</span></p><p><span>d.Effect of Microsoft’s Actions in the IAP Channel</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>307.As described above, Microsoft gave valuable consideration at no charge to IAPs that agreed to distribute and promote a product that brought no revenue to Microsoft.  By tendering additional valuable perquisites (at the cost of lost revenue), Microsoft induced IAPs to restrict drastically their distribution and promotion of Navigator.  With the offer of still other concessions, Microsoft induced IAPs to turn subscribers already using Navigator into Internet Explorer users.  </span></p><p><span>308.As Microsoft hoped and anticipated, the inducements it gave out </span><span>gratis</span><span>, as well as the restrictive conditions it tied to those inducements, had, and continue to have, a substantial exclusionary impact.   First, many more copies of Internet Explorer have been distributed, and many more IAPs have standardized on Internet Explorer, than would have been the case if Microsoft had not invested great sums, and sacrificed potential sources of revenue, with the sole purpose of protecting the applications barrier to entry.  Second, the restrictive terms in the agreements have prevented IAPs from meeting consumer demand for copies of non-Microsoft browsing software pre-configured for those services.  The IAPs subject to the most severe restrictions comprise fourteen of the top fifteen access providers in North America and account for a large majority of all Internet access subscriptions in this part of the world.</span></p><p><span>309.Not surprisingly, the inducements that Microsoft gave out and the restrictions it conditioned them upon have resulted in a substantial increase in Internet Explorer’s usage share.  A study Microsoft conducted shows that at the end of 1997, Internet Explorer enjoyed a ninety-</span></p><p><span>four percent weighted average share of shipments of browsing software by ISPs that had agreed to make Internet Explorer their default browser.  By contrast, the study shows that Internet Explorer had only a fourteen percent weighted average share of shipments of browsing software by ISPs that had not agreed to make Internet Explorer their default browser.  The same study shows that Microsoft’s weighted average share of browser usage by subscribers to ISPs that had made Internet Explorer their default browser was over sixty percent at the end of 1997, whereas its weighted average share of browser usage by subscribers to ISPs that did not make Internet Explorer their default browser was less than twenty percent.</span></p><p><span>310.An appropriate use of the AdKnowledge hit data shows the difference in Internet Explorer’s success among categories of IAPs subject to different levels of distribution and promotion restrictions (</span><span>see</span><span> Section V.H.1., </span><span>infra</span><span>, for a description of the method by which AdKnowledge collects data).  One category was hits originating from subscribers to IAPs that, according to a chart prepared by Microsoft for its internal use, were not subject to any distribution or promotion restrictions.  Another category was hits originating from subscribers to any IAP.  A third category was hits originating from subscribers to AOL and CompuServe.  The hit data show that, from January 1997 to August 1998, Internet Explorer’s usage share among subscribers to IAPs that were uninhibited by restrictions rose ten points, from about twenty to about thirty percent.  Over the same period, Internet Explorer’s usage share among all IAP subscribers, including those subject to restrictions, rose twenty-seven points, from twenty-two to forty-nine percent.  Finally, Internet’s Explorer’s usage share among subscribers to two IAPs subject to the most severe restrictions, AOL and CompuServe, rose sixty-five points, from twenty-two to eighty-seven percent.  The differences in the degree of Internet Explorer’s success in the three categories reveal the exclusionary effect of Microsoft’s interdiction of Navigator in the IAP channel.</span></p><p><span>4.Inducing ICPs to Enhance Internet Explorer’s Usage Share at Navigator’s Expense</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>311.ICPs create the content that fills the pages that make up the Web.  Because this content can include advertisements and links to download sites, ICPs also provide a channel for the promotion and distribution of Web browsing software.  Executives at Microsoft recognized that ICPs were not nearly as important a distribution channel for browsing software as OEMs and IAPs.  Nevertheless, protecting the applications barrier to entry was of such high priority at Microsoft that its senior executives were willing to invest significant resources to enlist even ICPs in the effort.  Executives at Microsoft determined that ICPs could aid Microsoft’s browser campaign in three ways.  First, ICPs could help build Internet Explorer’s usage share by featuring advertisements and links for Internet Explorer, to the exclusion of non-Microsoft browsing software, on their Web pages.  Second, those ICPs that distributed software as well as content could bundle Internet Explorer, instead of Navigator, with those distributions.  Finally, ICPs could increase demand for Internet Explorer, and decrease demand for Navigator, by creating their content with Microsoft technologies, such as ActiveX, that would make the content more appealing in appearance when accessed with Internet Explorer.</span></p><p><span>312.As early as the fall of 1995, Microsoft executives saw that they could help reinforce the applications barrier to entry by inducing the leading ICPs to focus on Microsoft’s browsing technologies.  In the October 1995 memorandum that Microsoft executives sent to Gates on Microsoft’s browser campaign, one of the suggestions was, “Get 80% of Top Web Sites to Target Our Client.”  Specifically, the executives wrote:</span></p><p><span>Content drives browser adoption, and we need to go to the top five sites and ask them, “What can we do to get you to adopt IE?”  We should be prepared to write a check, buy sites, or add features — basically do whatever it takes to drive adoption.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>313.By the middle of 1996, this proposal had become corporate policy.  Senior executives at Microsoft believed that inducing the ICPs responsible for the most popular Web sites to concentrate their distributional, promotional, and technical efforts on Internet Explorer to the exclusion of Navigator would contribute significantly to maximizing Internet Explorer’s usage share at Navigator’s expense.  When Microsoft began, in late 1996, to enlist the aid of the most popular ICPs, it used an inducement that it had already successfully employed with the top IAPs: Microsoft created an area on the ubiquitous Windows billboard for the promotion of ICPs and then exchanged placement in that area at no charge for the commitment of important ICPs to promote and distribute Internet Explorer exclusively and to create their content with technologies that would make it appear optimally when viewed with Internet Explorer.  Microsoft executives referred to this tactic as “strategic barter.”  As was the case with the IAPs, neither the sacrifice that Microsoft made to enlist the aid of the top ICPs nor the restrictions it placed on them can be explained except as components of a campaign to protect the applications barrier to entry against Navigator.</span></p><p><span> 314.The Active Desktop was a Microsoft feature that, if enabled, allowed the Windows user to position Web pages as open windows that appear on the background, or “wallpaper” of the Windows desktop.  If the Web pages featured “push” technology, they would automatically update themselves by downloading information from their respective servers at times scheduled by the user.  Thus, a user could position on his desktop wallpaper Web pages that displayed periodically updated stock prices, sports scores, and news headlines.  The Channel Bar was a feature of the Active Desktop.   If enabled, the Channel Bar appeared as a rectangular graphic on the desktop wallpaper.  It was divided into pre-configured links to the Web sites of certain ICPs that implemented push technology.  Microsoft introduced the Active Desktop, including the Channel Bar, as a feature of Internet Explorer 4.0, which it released on September 30, 1997.</span></p><p><span>315.As pre-configured by Microsoft, the top channel on the Channel Bar linked to a Microsoft Web site, called the “Active Channel Guide,” that provided a list of sites enabled with push technology.  The next five channels were each labeled with a generic category such as “News & Technology” or “Business.”  Clicking on one of these five channels brought up a display of icons for specific Web sites.  For example, clicking on the “Sports” channel brought up a display including icons for sports-related Web sites such as ESPN SportsZone and CNN SI.  Below the five generic category channels were branded ones, each of which would link the user directly to a specific ICP’s Web site.</span></p><p><span>316.Considering how ICPs generate revenue, it is not surprising that they attached great value to placement on the Channel Bar.  Most ICPs charge fees for placing advertisements on their Web pages.  In addition, some ICPs display certain of their content only to users who pay a fee.  The higher the volume of user traffic an ICP’s site attracts, the higher the rates it can charge for the placement of advertising on its sites.  Higher volume also brings increased revenue to ICPs that charge users for content.  Microsoft pre-configured Internet Explorer 4.0 so that the Active desktop and the Channel Bar would appear by default on a user’s Windows 95 PC system, and Microsoft forbade OEMs to disable either feature.  Microsoft and the ICPs consequently surmised that a very high volume of user traffic would be driven to the Web sites for which channels appeared on the Channel Bar.  Intuit, for one, believed that placement on the Windows desktop would provide it with unparalleled promotional and distributional advantages.  As a result, the company was prepared to pay a substantial fee for placement on the Channel Bar.  The managers of ZDNet felt the same way, as did the executives responsible for Disney’s Internet content.  Some ICPs, including Intuit, even admitted to Microsoft that inclusion on the Channel Bar was critical to them and asked what they would be obliged to pay to be included.  </span></p><p><span>317.Based on the interest ICPs expressed, as well as Microsoft’s own assessment of the value of placement on the Channel Bar, executives at Microsoft considered charging ICPs for inclusion on the Channel Bar.  They estimated that ICPs appearing directly on the Channel Bar would pay as much as $10 million per year, and that even ICPs appearing under the generic channels would pay a couple of million dollars each annually.  These estimates proved to comport well with the value that ICPs themselves actually attached to inclusion in the Channel Bar, at least before the feature had been tested in the marketplace.  For example, in December 1996, more than nine months before the Active Desktop made its debut, Microsoft signed an agreement with PointCast pursuant to which PointCast agreed to pay $10 million for the first year that its channel would appear directly on the Channel Bar.</span></p><p><span>318.Following the signing of its agreement with PointCast, Microsoft proceeded to enter similar “Top Tier” or “Platinum” agreements with twenty-three other ICPs, all in the summer and early fall of 1997.  Microsoft used the term “Top Tier” to refer to the four non-</span></p><p><span>Microsoft ICPs (including PointCast) given placement directly on the Channel Bar and the term “Platinum” to describe the twenty ICPs included in the five generic categories accessible from the Channel Bar.  Although the agreements were individually negotiated and their terms varied to some extent, the typical agreement obligated Microsoft to promote the ICP’s business in three ways.  First, Microsoft agreed to include on the Channel Bar (or in one of the lists accessible directly from the Channel Bar) a link that would send a user directly to the ICP’s “push” site.  Second, Microsoft agreed to promote the ICP’s content in national public-relations and computer-industry events, as well as on Microsoft Web sites.  Finally, Microsoft agreed to include introductory content from the ICP with certain distributions of Windows and Internet Explorer.</span></p><p><span>319.The agreements did not obligate the Top Tier and Platinum ICPs to pay money to Microsoft in exchange for any of the benefits, including placement on the Windows desktop, that Microsoft extended to them.  Rather, the agreements obligated the ICPs to compensate Microsoft in other ways.  Although the agreement that PointCast signed purported to call for a payment of ten million dollars to Microsoft, it entitled PointCast to a discount on the full amount if it behaved as other ICPs undertook to do in their own Top Tier and Platinum agreements with Microsoft.</span></p><p><span>320.The first obligation that the ICPs undertook was to distribute Internet Explorer and no “Other Browser” in connection with any custom Web browsing software or CD-ROM content that they might offer.  The term “Other Browser” was defined in the agreements as Web browsing software that ranked first or second by organizations in the business of measuring the usage of browsing software.  This obligation was pertinent only to the six Top Tier and Platinum ICPs that distributed Web browsing software during the term of the agreements:  PointCast, CNet, Intuit, AOL, Disney, and National Geographic.</span></p><p><span>321.The Top Tier and Platinum agreements also required the signatory ICPs to promote Internet Explorer and no “Other Browser” as their “browser of choice.”  In particular, the ICPs were required to display a logo for Internet Explorer and no “Other Browser” on the home page of the sites specified in the agreements and on any other pages on which the ICP typically displayed such links.  The ICPs were also required to place Internet Explorer download links on their Web sites and to remove any links to Navigator’s download site.  Aggregating the Web sites offered by the twenty-four Top Tier and Platinum ICPs, the number of Web sites affected by this provision was thirty-one.</span></p><p><span>322.A third provision that the ICPs accepted in return for placement on the Channel Bar was a prohibition against their entering agreements with a vendor of an “Other Browser” whereby the ICPs would pay money or provide other consideration to the vendor in exchange for the vendor’s promotion of the ICP’s branded content.  Finally, the agreements required the ICPs, in designing their Web sites, to employ certain Microsoft technologies such as Dynamic HTML and ActiveX.  Some of the agreements actually required the ICPs to create “differentiated content” that was either available only to Internet Explorer users or would be more attractive when viewed with Internet Explorer than with any “Other Browser.”  For example, the agreement with Intuit provided: “Some differentiated content may be available only to IE users, some may simply be ‘best when used with IE,’ with acceptable degradation when used with other browsers.”</span></p><p><span>323.The ICPs were so intent on gaining placement on the Channel Bar that they even complied, albeit reluctantly, when Microsoft imposed restrictions not contained in the Top Tier and Platinum agreements.  For example, Microsoft demanded that Disney remove its distinctive branding from its link on Navigator’s user interface and threatened to remove Disney from the Channel Bar if it did not accede.  Executives at Disney believed that such a requirement went beyond the language of the Top Tier agreement that Disney had signed with Microsoft, but they saw no recourse in making an issue of the matter, for Microsoft could keep the Disney icon off the Channel Bar during the pendency of the dispute, and Microsoft would be less amenable to promotional opportunities for Disney in the future.  Therefore, Disney capitulated.  In a similar fashion, a Microsoft employee told a counterpart at Wired Digital that even if the agreement between the companies did not technically prohibit it, Wired Digital would be violating the spirit of its agreement if it placed a link to any of its subsidiary sites on Navigator’s user interface.  What Microsoft wanted to avoid were announcements suggesting that any of Microsoft’s ICP partners were also cooperating with Netscape.</span></p><p><span>324.Intuit is a leading developer of software designed to help individuals and small businesses manage their finances.  A consumer can use one of Intuit’s popular products by purchasing a copy of the software, but Intuit makes additional features available through its Quicken.com Web site.  Thus, Intuit is both an ISV and an ICP.  Beginning in late 1995, Intuit distributed Navigator with its products in order to ensure that its users could access the features provided through Quicken.com.  In 1996, Microsoft commenced the process of converting Intuit from a Netscape partner to a distributor of Internet Explorer.  In July of that year, Gates reported to other Microsoft executives on his attempt to convince Intuit’s CEO to distribute Internet Explorer instead of Navigator:</span></p><p><span>I made it clear to him that beyond giving him the best browser technology for no cost that we were only will[ing] to do some very modest favors in addition to that. . . .  I was quite frank with him that if he had a favor we could do for him that would cost us something like $1M to do that in return for switching browsers in the next few months I would be open to doing that.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>325.Intuit did not accept Gates’ offer immediately, but less than a year later, in June 1997, Intuit became one of the ICPs to sign a Platinum agreement with Microsoft.  This allowed Intuit to place a link to Quicken.com under the “Business” heading on Microsoft’s Channel Bar.  In return, however, the agreement required Intuit to distribute Internet Explorer, and no “Other Browser,” with its software products, including those not distributed through the Channel Bar.  Intuit also agreed to the other terms, relating to the promotion of browsing technologies, business relationships with Netscape, and the adoption of Internet Explorer technologies, that applied to the other Top Tier and Platinum ICPs.  </span></p><p><span>326.Microsoft would have granted Intuit a license to distribute the componentized version of Internet Explorer at no charge even if Intuit had not entered a Platinum Agreement.  In the absence of the agreement’s restrictive terms, in fact, Intuit likely would have distributed the componentized version of Internet Explorer with its products while simultaneously promoting Navigator and distributing to consumers who requested it a version of Navigator specially-</span></p><p><span>configured for Intuit’s products.  The only way Intuit could gain a place on the Channel Bar, however, was by agreeing to the provisions that required it to limit its promotion of Navigator, to cease distributing that browser altogether, and to refuse to pay Netscape to promote Intuit products on Netscape’s Web sites.  Intuit accepted these terms reluctantly, for Navigator remained a popular product with consumers, and Netscape’s Web sites still attracted a great deal of traffic.</span></p><p><span>327.In addition to the Top Tier and Platinum agreements, Microsoft entered into two other types of agreements with ICPs.  First, Microsoft signed so-called “Gold” agreements with between thirty and fifty ICPs.  Pursuant to these agreements, Microsoft included ICPs in the “Active Channel Guide” Web site, which appeared whenever a Windows user clicked on the top link on the Channel Bar.  In exchange for this promotion, the Gold-agreement ICPs agreed to promote Internet Explorer on at least equal footing with other browsing technology, including Navigator.</span></p><p><span>328.Second, Microsoft entered into IEAK agreements with between eight and twelve ICPs devoted to business-related content.  Under the typical IEAK agreement, Microsoft agreed to include functionality in the IEAK that would facilitate the inclusion of a link to the ICP’s Web site under the “Business” category of the Channel Bar.  In exchange, the ICPs committed to distributing Internet Explorer exclusively (to the extent they distributed any browsing software), to promote Internet Explorer as their “browser software of choice,” to refrain from promoting any “Other Browser” (defined as in the other ICP agreements) on their Web sites, and to create content that could be accessed optimally only with Internet Explorer.</span></p><p><span>329.Cross-marketing arrangements in competitive markets do not necessarily make those markets less competitive; however, four characteristics distinguish this case from situations in which such agreements are benign.  First, Microsoft was able to offer ICPs an asset whose value competitors could not hope, on account of Microsoft’s monopoly power, to match.  Second, Microsoft bartered that asset not to increase demand for a revenue-generating product, but rather to suppress the distribution and diminish the attractiveness of technology that Microsoft saw as a potential threat to its monopoly power.  Third, and more specifically, Microsoft prohibited the ICPs from compensating Netscape for promotion of their products even while not attempting to prohibit the promotion itself.  This reveals that Microsoft’s motivation was not simply a desire to generate brand associations with Internet Explorer.  Finally, Microsoft went beyond encouraging ICPs to take advantage of innovations in Microsoft’s technology, explicitly requiring them to ensure that their content appeared degraded when viewed with Navigator rather than Internet Explorer.  Microsoft’s desire to lower demand for Navigator was thus independent of, and far more malevolent than, a simple desire to increase demand for Internet Explorer.  </span></p><p><span>330.The terms of Microsoft’s agreements with ICPs cannot be explained in customary economic parlance absent Microsoft’s obsession with obliterating the threat that Navigator posed to the applications barrier to entry.  Absent that obsession, Microsoft would not have given ICPs at no charge licenses to distribute Internet Explorer.  What is more, Microsoft would not have incurred the cost of componentizing Internet Explorer and then licensed that version to Intuit at no charge.  By sacrificing opportunities to cover its costs and even make a profit, Microsoft advanced its strategic goal of maximizing Internet Explorer’s usage share at Navigator’s expense.  Whereas Microsoft might have developed the Channel Bar without ulterior motive as a matter of product improvement, it would not have exchanged placement on the Channel Bar for terms as highly and broadly restrictive as the ones it actually extracted from ICPs.  Nevertheless, and to Microsoft’s dismay, circumstances prevented these restrictions from having a large impact on the relative usage shares of Internet Explorer and Navigator.</span></p><p><span>331.Despite Microsoft’s and the ICPs’ expectations to the contrary, consumers showed little interest in the Channel Bar, or in the Active Desktop in general, when the features debuted in the fall of 1997.  Moreover, reviews of the Channel Bar in computer-related publications were generally unfavorable.  The Channel Bar may not have attracted consumer interest, but the ICP agreements relating to the Channel Bar did attract controversy.  Indeed, Gates faced pointed questions about them when he appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee in March 1998.  Microsoft took several measures to quell the public criticism in early April 1998.  First, it waived the most restrictive terms in the Top Tier and Platinum agreements; thereafter, the agreements required ICPs merely to promote Internet Explorer in a manner at least equal to their promotion of Navigator.  Second, Microsoft made no attempt to renew the Gold and IEAK agreements, which had expired by their own terms in March 1998.  Third, Microsoft authorized its OEM licensees to configure the Windows 98 desktop so that the Channel Bar would not appear by default, and nearly every major OEM availed itself of the permission.  Deeming the Channel Bar more trouble than it was worth, Microsoft decided to eliminate the feature entirely from future versions of Windows, including Windows 98 updates.  Therefore, the provisions requiring ICPs to exclusively distribute and promote Internet Explorer had all expired within seven months of the Channel Bar’s release.  All of the Top Tier and Platinum agreements had expired by their own terms by December 31, 1998.  In light of its decision to discontinue the Channel Bar, Microsoft did not seek to renew any of them.</span></p><p><span>332.For a period of about eight months, however, agreements with Microsoft had prohibited approximately thirty-four ICPs from distributing Navigator and from promoting Navigator in all but a few ways.  For an overlapping period of between a year and a year-and-a-</span></p><p><span>half, those thirty-four ICPs, plus between thirty and fifty more, were required to promote Internet Explorer at least as prominently as they promoted Navigator.  Although the affected Web sites made up only a tiny percentage of those existing on the Web, they comprised the offerings of all but a few of the most popular ICPs.  If the estimation of one Microsoft employee in June 1996 can be considered accurate, the affected ICPs accounted for a significant percentage of the Web traffic in North America.  Still, there is not sufficient evidence to support a finding that Microsoft’s promotional restrictions actually had a substantial, deleterious impact on Navigator’s usage share.  For one thing, only six of the affected ICPs distributed any Web browsing software bundled with their products during the period in which Microsoft’s distributional restrictions remained in effect.  AOL obviously distributed a substantial volume of Web browsing software during this period, but since AOL was separately precluded under its Online Services Folder agreement from distributing virtually any non-Microsoft browsing software, AOL would not have distributed a significant number of Navigator copies even if it had not entered a Top Tier agreement with Microsoft.  </span></p><p><span>333.Pursuant to its agreement with Microsoft, Intuit distributed over five million copies of Internet Explorer with the 1998 versions of its products.  Microsoft had offered Intuit a componentized browser while Netscape had not, and it stands to reason that Intuit would in all probability have distributed close to the same number of Internet Explorer copies even absent the distributional restrictions imposed by its contract.  Still, Intuit had distributed over five million copies of Navigator with the 1997 versions of its products.  Unconstrained by its agreement with Microsoft, Intuit might have distributed with its 1998 products a sum approaching that number of Navigator copies along with the componentized version of Internet Explorer (particularly if the CD-ROM represented its primary distribution vehicle).  Of the affected ICPs (excluding AOL), Intuit almost certainly distributed the most Web browsing software bundled with its products.  </span></p><p><span>334.All of the Top Tier, Platinum, and IEAK ICPs were capable of including download links on their Web pages.  While many of these ICPs had included such links for Navigator prior to entering agreements with Microsoft, only Internet Explorer download links were allowed while the restrictive terms were in effect.  On the whole, it is reasonable to deduce from the evidence that the restrictions Microsoft imposed on ICPs prevented the distribution and installation of a significant quantity, but certainly less than ten million, copies of Navigator.</span></p><p><span>335.The terms Microsoft imposed did prevent a number of the ICPs otherwise inclined to do so from compensating Netscape for its promotion of the ICPs’ content in Navigator or on Netscape’s Web sites.  While they were in effect, Microsoft’s restrictions probably deprived Netscape of revenue measured in millions of dollars, but nowhere near $100 million.</span></p><p><span>336.It appears that, at the time the obligation expired, Microsoft had not yet begun to enforce its requirement that the Top Tier, Platinum, and IEAK ICPs develop content that would appear more attractive when viewed with Internet Explorer than when viewed with Navigator.  Moreover, there is no evidence that any ICP other than Disney developed any “differentiated content” in response to its agreement with Microsoft.  Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to find that the requirements that Microsoft sought to impose with respect to the use of Microsoft-specific browsing technologies had any discernible, deleterious impact on Navigator’s usage share.</span></p><p><span>5.Directly Inducing ISVs to Rely on Microsoft’s Browsing Technologies Rather than APIs Exposed by Navigator</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>337.Since 1995, more and more ISVs have, like Intuit, enhanced the features of their applications by designing them to take advantage of the type of content and functionality accessible through browsing software.  An increasing number of these applications actually rely on browsing software to function.  Microsoft’s efforts to maximize Internet Explorer’s share of browser usage at Navigator’s expense were intended to encourage developers to use Windows-</span></p><p><span>specific technologies when they wrote their applications to rely on a browser.  In addition to creating this incentive indirectly, by disadvantaging Navigator, Microsoft also targeted individual ISVs directly, extracting from them commitments to make their Web-centric applications reliant on technology specific to Internet Explorer.  </span></p><p><span>338.Because of the importance of “time-to-market” in the software industry, ISVs developing software to run on Windows products seek to obtain beta releases and other technical information relating to Windows as early and as consistently as possible.  Since Microsoft decides which ISVs receive betas and other technical support, and when they will receive it, the ability of an ISV to compete in the marketplace for software running on Windows products is highly dependent on Microsoft’s cooperation.  Netscape learned this lesson in 1995.</span></p><p><span>339.In dozens of “First Wave” agreements signed between the fall of 1997 and the spring of 1998, Microsoft has promised to give preferential support, in the form of early Windows 98 and Windows NT betas, other technical information, and the right to use certain Microsoft seals of approval, to important ISVs that agree to certain conditions.  One of these conditions is that the ISVs use Internet Explorer as the default browsing software for any software they develop with a hypertext-based user interface.  Another condition is that the ISVs use Microsoft’s “HTML Help,” which is accessible only with Internet Explorer, to implement their applications’ help systems.</span></p><p><span>340.By exchanging its vital support for the agreement of leading ISVs to make Internet Explorer the default browsing software on which their products rely, Microsoft has ensured that many of the most popular Web-centric applications will rely on browsing technologies found only in Windows and has increased the likelihood that the millions of consumers using these products will use Internet Explorer rather than Navigator.  Microsoft’s relations with ISVs thus represent another area in which it has applied its monopoly power to the task of protecting the applications barrier to entry.</span></p><p><span>6.Foreclosing Apple as a Distribution Channel for Navigator</span></p><p><span>341.</span><span>In the summer of 1995, Microsoft had been willing to cede to Netscape the development of browsing software for the Mac OS, provided that Netscape would stop competing with the platform-level browsing technologies that Microsoft was developing for its 32-bit Windows products.  The genesis of this offer had been Microsoft’s belief that Netscape could never become the leading platform for network-centric software development if it did not distribute a middleware layer for the soon-to-be dominant 32-bit Windows platform.  But once Netscape confirmed its determination to offer a middleware layer that would expose the same set of APIs on Windows, the Mac OS, and other platforms, Microsoft recognized that it needed to stifle the attention that developers would be inclined to devote to those APIs, even when the they rested on top of a non-Windows platform like the Mac OS.  After all, if Navigator became so popular on the Mac OS that developers made extensive use of the APIs exposed by that version of Navigator, those developers would be disposed to take advantage of identical APIs exposed by the version of Navigator written for the dominant platform, Windows.  Microsoft therefore set out to convince developers that applications relying on APIs exposed by Navigator would not reach as many Mac OS users as applications that invoked platform technologies found exclusively in Windows.  Therefore, Microsoft set out to recruit Mac OS users to Internet Explorer, and to minimize Navigator’s usage share among Mac OS users.</span></p><p><span>342.Just as pre-installation and promotion by OEMs is one of the most effective means of raising the usage share of browsing software among users of Intel-compatible PC systems, pre-</span></p><p><span>installation and promotion by Apple is one of the most effective means of raising the usage share of browsing software among the users of Apple PC systems.  Recognizing this, Bill Gates consistently urged Microsoft executives to persuade Apple to pre-install the Mac OS version of Internet Explorer on its PC systems and to feature it more prominently than the Mac OS version of Navigator.</span></p><p><span>343.By the summer of 1996, Apple was already shipping Internet Explorer with the Mac OS, but it was pre-installing Navigator as the default browsing software.  After a meeting with Apple in June 1996, Gates wrote to some of his top executives:  “I have 2 key goals in investing in the Apple relationship - 1) Maintain our applications share on the platform and 2) See if we can get them to embrace Internet Explorer in some way.”  Later in the same message, Gates expressed his desire that Apple “agree to immediately ship IE on all their systems as the standard browser.”</span></p><p><span>344.One point of leverage that Microsoft held over Apple was the fact that ninety percent of Mac OS users running a suite of office productivity applications had adopted Microsoft’s Mac Office.  In 1997, Apple’s business was in steep decline, and many doubted that the company would survive much longer.  Observing Apple’s poor performance in the marketplace and its dismal prospects for the future, many ISVs questioned the wisdom of continuing to spend time and money developing applications for the Mac OS.  Had Microsoft announced in the midst of this atmosphere that it was ceasing to develop new versions of Mac Office, a great number of ISVs, customers, developers, and investors would have interpreted the announcement as Apple’s death notice.</span></p><p><span>345.Recognizing the importance of Mac Office to Apple’s survival, Microsoft threatened to cancel the product unless Apple compromised on a number of outstanding issues between the companies.  One of these issues was the extent to which Apple distributed and promoted Internet Explorer, as opposed to Navigator, with the Mac OS.</span></p><p><span>346.At the end of June 1997, the Microsoft executive in charge of Mac Office, Ben Waldman, sent a message to Gates and Microsoft’s Chief Financial Officer, Greg Maffei.  The message reflected Waldman’s understanding that Microsoft was threatening to cancel Mac Office:</span></p><p><span>The pace of our discussions with Apple as well as their recent unsatisfactory response have certainly frustrated a lot of people at Microsoft.  The threat to cancel Mac Office 97 is certainly the strongest bargaining point we have, as doing so will do a great deal of harm to Apple immediately.  I also believe that Apple is taking this threat pretty seriously . . . .</span></p><p><span>347.Waldman was actually an advocate for releasing Mac Office 97 promptly, and he pressed for that outcome in his message to Gates and Maffei.  Although they applauded Waldman’s devotion to the product, Gates and Maffei made clear that the threat of canceling Mac Office was too valuable a source of leverage to give up before Microsoft had extracted acceptable concessions from Apple.  Maffei wrote Waldman, “Ben - great mail, but [we] need a way to push these guys and this is the only one that seems to make them move.”  In his response to Waldman, Gates asked whether Microsoft could conceal from Apple in the coming month the fact that Microsoft was almost finished developing of Mac Office 97.</span></p><p><span>348.In order to assure his superiors that he was pursuing corporate policy despite his personal convictions, Waldman reported to Maffei in his June 1997 message that he had recently told his counterpart at Apple that Maffei “would be recommending to Bill [Gates] that we cancel Mac Office 97.”  Waldman believed that his counterpart “got the message that we would, in fact, cancel.”  Waldman went on to write that when his counterpart had asked what specific problems Microsoft had with Apple’s recent response to Microsoft’s proposals, Waldman had replied by mentioning four issues, including “IE equal access.”  By that, Waldman meant Microsoft’s demand that the Mac OS make Internet Explorer just as available to its users as it made Navigator.  According to Waldman, the Apple employee had responded that Apple would not be able to change the Mac OS’s default browser from Navigator until it released the next version of the operating system product in the summer of 1998.</span></p><p><span>349.A few days after the exchange with Waldman, Gates informed those Microsoft executives most closely involved in the negotiations with Apple that the discussions “have not been going well at all.”  One of the several reasons for this, Gates wrote, was that “Apple let us down on the browser by making Netscape the standard install.”  Gates then reported that he had already called Apple’s CEO (who at the time was Gil Amelio) to ask “how we should announce the cancellation of Mac Office . . . .”</span></p><p><span>350.Within a month of Gates’ call to Amelio, Steve Jobs was once again Apple’s CEO, and the two companies had settled all outstanding issues between them in three agreements, all of which were signed on August 7, 1997.  Under the agreement titled “Technology Agreement,” which remains in force today, Microsoft’s primary obligation is to continue releasing up-to-date versions of Mac Office for at least five years.  Among the obligations that the Technology Agreement places on Apple are several relating to browsing software.</span></p><p><span>351.First, Apple has agreed, for as long as Microsoft remains in compliance with its obligation to support Mac Office, to “bundle the most current version of Microsoft’s Internet Explorer for Macintosh . . . with all system software releases for Macintosh Computers (‘MacOS’) sold by Apple.”  The Technology Agreement also provides: “While Apple may bundle browsers other than Internet Explorer with such Mac OS system software releases, Apple will make Internet Explorer for Macintosh the default selection in the choice of all included internet browsers (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, when the user invokes the “Browse the Internet” or equivalent icon, the Mac OS will launch Internet Explorer for Macintosh).”  In fulfillment of this requirement, Apple did not include Navigator in the default installation of the Mac OS 8.5 upgrade product.  In other words, Navigator is not installed on the computer hard drive during the default installation, which is the type of installation most users elect to employ.  Therefore, most users who upgraded their Macintosh systems to Mac OS 8.5 were unable to access Navigator without doing a customized installation.  Having already installed an altogether adequate browser (Internet Explorer) when the Mac OS 8.5 upgrade completed its default installation process, however, most users are unlikely to trouble to install Navigator as well.</span></p><p><span>352.The Technology Agreement further provides that “[a]ny other internet browsers bundled in the Mac OS system software sold by Apple shall be placed in folders in the software as released.”  In other words, Apple may not position icons for non-Microsoft browsing software on the desktop of new Macintosh PC systems or Mac OS upgrades.  Moreover, the agreement states that “Apple will not be proactive or initiate actions to encourage users to swap out Internet Explorer for Macintosh.”  Both Apple and Microsoft read this term to prohibit Apple from promoting non-Microsoft browsing software.  The agreement even states that Apple will “encourage its employees to use Microsoft Internet Explorer for Macintosh for all Apple-</span></p><p><span>sponsored events and will not promote another browser to its employees.”  Pursuant to this provision, Apple’s management has instructed the firm’s employees to not use Navigator in demonstrations at trade shows and other public events.  Also with regard to the promotion of browser technology, the agreement requires Apple to display the Internet Explorer logo on “all Apple-controlled web pages where any browser logo is displayed.”  Finally, the agreement grants Microsoft the right of first refusal to supply the default browsing software for any new operating system product that Apple develops during the term of the agreement.</span></p><p><span>353.At the same time that it entered the Technology Agreement, Microsoft concluded a “Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement” and a “Patent Cross License Agreement” with Apple.  These latter two agreements place obligations on Microsoft that are unrelated to Mac Office, and they bind Apple in areas other than browsing software.  The fact that Microsoft and Apple entered two other agreements at the same time that they entered the Technology Agreement does not change the fact that Microsoft’s commitment to continue developing Mac Office was at least partial consideration for Apple’s commitment to distribute and promote Internet Explorer more favorably than Navigator.  Indeed, the language of the agreements themselves demonstrates that Microsoft and Apple saw the Mac Office and Internet Explorer obligations as more closely linked to each other than to any other obligations the parties simultaneously undertook:  Whereas the provision in the Technology Agreement setting forth Apple’s obligations relating to browsing software explicitly states that those obligations will last as long as Microsoft complies with its obligation to continue supporting Mac Office, the provisions in the other two agreements describing the patent cross-license and Microsoft’s purchase of Apple stock mention neither browsing software nor Mac Office.  </span></p><p><span>354.That the Mac Office and browsing software obligations are tied to each other is highlighted by the fact that the Microsoft executives who negotiated the agreement believe that Microsoft’s remedy, were Apple to fail to meet its obligations with respect to browsing software, would be to discontinue Mac Office.  When, in February 1998, a Microsoft employee proposed giving Apple an HTML control in exchange for Apple’s agreement to use Internet Explorer as its standard browser internally, Waldman informed the employee that Apple was already obligated to use Internet Explorer as its standard browser internally and that Microsoft would revive the threat to discontinue Mac Office if Apple failed to comply with its obligation.  In Waldman’s words:</span></p><p><span>Sounds like we give them the HTML control for nothing except making IE the “standard browser for Apple?”  I think they should be doing this anyway.  Though the language of the agreement uses the word “encourage,” I think that the spirit is that Apple should be using it everywhere and if they don’t do it, then we can use Office as a club.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>For at least a year after the Technology Agreement went into effect, Waldman and other Microsoft employees continued to use the threat of reduced commitment to Mac Office in holding Apple to its commitments to support Internet Explorer.</span></p><p><span>355.Apple increased its distribution and promotion of Internet Explorer not because of a conviction that the quality of Microsoft’s product was superior to Navigator’s, or that consumer demand for it was greater, but rather because of the </span><span>in</span><span/><span>terrorem</span><span> effect of the prospect of the loss of Mac Office.  To be blunt, Microsoft threatened to refuse to sell a profitable product to Apple, a product in whose development Microsoft had invested substantial resources, and which was virtually ready for shipment.  Not only would this ploy have wasted sunk costs and sacrificed substantial profit, it also would have damaged Microsoft’s goodwill among Apple’s customers, whom Microsoft had led to expect a new version of Mac Office.  The predominant reason Microsoft was prepared to make this sacrifice, and the sole reason that it required Apple to make Internet Explorer its default browser and restricted Apple’s freedom to feature and promote non-</span></p><p><span>Microsoft browsing software, was to protect the applications barrier to entry.  More specifically, the requirements and restrictions relating to browsing software were intended to raise Internet Explorer’s usage share, to lower Navigator’s share, and more broadly to demonstrate to important observers (including consumer, developers, industry participants, and investors) that Navigator’s success had crested.  Had Microsoft’s only interest in developing the Mac OS version of Internet Explorer been to enable organizational customers using multiple PC operating-system products to standardize on one user interface for Web browsing, Microsoft would not have extracted from Apple the commitment to make Internet Explorer the default browser or imposed restrictions on its use and promotion of Navigator.</span></p><p><span>356.Microsoft understands that PC users tend to use the browsing software that comes pre-installed on their machines, particularly when conspicuous means of easy access appear on the PC desktop.  By guaranteeing that Internet Explorer is the default browsing software on the Mac OS, by relegating Navigator to less favorable placement, by requiring Navigator’s exclusion from the default installation for the Mac OS 8.5 upgrade, and by otherwise limiting Apple’s promotion of Navigator, Microsoft has ensured that most users of the Mac OS will use Internet Explorer and not Navigator.  Although the number of Mac OS users is very small compared to the Windows installed base, the Mac OS is nevertheless the most important consumer-oriented operating system product next to Windows.  Navigator needed high usage share among Mac OS users if it was ever to enable the development of a substantial body of cross-platform software not dependent on Windows.  By extracting from Apple terms that significantly diminished the usage of Navigator on the Mac OS, Microsoft severely sabotaged Navigator’s potential to weaken the applications barrier to entry.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>G.Microsoft’s Success</span><span/><span>in Excluding Navigator from the Channels that Lead Most Efficiently to Browser Usage</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>357.The cumulative effect of the stratagems described above was to ensure that the easiest and most intuitive paths that users could take to the Web would lead to Internet Explorer, the gate controlled by Microsoft.  Microsoft did not actually prevent users from obtaining and using Navigator (although it tried to do as much in June 1995), but Microsoft did make it significantly less convenient for them to do so.  Once Internet Explorer was seen as providing roughly the same browsing experience as Navigator, relatively few PC users showed any inclination to expend the effort required to obtain and install Navigator.  Netscape could still carpet bomb the population with CD-ROMs and make Navigator available for downloading.  In reality, however, few new users (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, ones not merely upgrading from an old version of Navigator to a new one) had any incentive to install — much less download and install — software to replicate a function for which OEMs and IAPs were already placing perfectly adequate browsing software at their disposal.  The fact that Netscape was forced to distribute tens of millions of copies of Navigator through high-cost carpet-bombing in order to obtain a relatively small number of new users only discloses the extent of Microsoft’s success in excluding Navigator from the channels that lead most effectively to browser usage.</span></p><p><span>H.The Success of Microsoft’s Effort to Maximize Internet Explorer’s Usage Share at Navigator’s Expense</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>358.Microsoft’s efforts to maximize Internet Explorer’s share of browser usage at Navigator’s expense have done just that.  The period since 1996 has witnessed a large increase in the usage of Microsoft’s browsing technologies and a concomitant decline in Navigator’s share.  This reversal of fortune might not have occurred had Microsoft not improved the quality of Internet Explorer, and some part of the reversal is undoubtedly attributable to Microsoft’s decision to distribute Internet Explorer with Windows at no additional charge.  The relative shares would not have changed nearly as much as they did, however, had Microsoft not devoted its monopoly power and monopoly profits to precisely that end.</span></p><p><span>1.The Change in the Usage Shares of Internet Explorer and Navigator</span></p><p><span>359.A developer of network-centric applications wants as many consumers as possible to acquire and use its products.  It knows that only consumers running a browser that exposes the requisite APIs will be able to use network-centric applications that rely on those APIs.  So in deciding whether to concentrate its development work on APIs exposed by Netscape’s Web browsing software or Microsoft’s, one of the questions a developer will ask is how much Navigator is being used in relation to Internet Explorer.  Dividing the total usage of each browser product by the total usage of all browsing software (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, usage of the installed base) answers this question, for it reveals the proportion of total usage accounted for by each product.  The relative attractiveness to developers of Navigator and Internet Explorer thus depends to a large extent on their relative shares of all browser usage.  </span></p><p><span>360.According to estimates that Microsoft executives cited to support their testimony in this trial, and those on which Microsoft relied in the course of its business planning, the shares of all browser usage enjoyed by Navigator and Internet Explorer changed dramatically in favor of Internet Explorer after Microsoft began its campaign to protect the applications barrier to entry.  These estimates show that Navigator’s share fell from above eighty percent in January 1996 to fifty-five percent in November 1997, and that Internet Explorer’s share rose from around five percent to thirty-six percent over the same period.  In April 1998, Microsoft relied on measurements for internal planning purposes that placed Internet Explorer’s share of all browser usage above forty-five percent.  These figures are broadly consistent with ones AOL relied on in evaluating its acquisition of Netscape:  AOL determined that Navigator’s share had fallen from around eighty percent at the end of 1996 to the “mid 50% range” in July 1998 and that Internet Explorer’s share had climbed to between forty-five and fifty percent of the domestic market by late 1998.</span></p><p><span>361.Before a developer sinks costs into writing applications that rely on APIs exposed by Navigator or Internet Explorer, the developer will also want to know what share of browser usage each of the competing platforms will enjoy in the future, when the developer’s applications will reach the marketplace, and even farther into the future, when the developer will try to sell updated versions of those applications.  Dividing the new usage of each browser product by the new usage of all browsing software (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, incremental usage) helps to formulate a prediction.  If a browser product’s current share of all browser usage is fifty percent, and its share of incremental browser usage is thirty percent, the product’s share of all browser usage will, assuming the share of incremental usage does not rise, gradually approach thirty percent, as the size of the population of browser users grows and current users update their PC systems.  So Navigator’s and Internet Explorer’s relative attractiveness as platforms also depends greatly on their relative shares of incremental browser usage.  Microsoft’s tactics were focused on channels for the distribution of new browsing software.  Moreover, excluding the installed base from the calculation heightens the sensitivity with which share of incremental browser usage reacts to contemporaneous forces.  Microsoft was thus particularly interested in share of incremental browser usage, not only as an indication of Navigator’s and Internet Explorer’s relative attractiveness as platforms, but also as a sensitive reading of the impact that its actions were having.</span></p><p><span>362.According to data on which Microsoft relied in the course of its business, Internet Explorer was, by late 1997, capturing a larger share of incremental browser usage than Navigator.  Specifically, data that the company then deemed reliable showed that fifty-seven percent of the new users of browsing software in the last six months of 1997 used Internet Explorer, while only thirty-nine percent used Navigator.  By February 1998, Microsoft’s data showed that sixty-two percent of the new Internet connections over the previous six months were using Internet Explorer, versus thirty-eight percent for Navigator.  Since there is no indication that Navigator users as a group employ their browsers more than Internet Explorer users, these data indicate that Internet Explorer’s share of incremental usage had exceeded Navigator’s by late 1997.  This meant that Internet Explorer’s share of all browser usage was moving to surpass Navigator’s.  To Microsoft, these numbers not only marked a significant decline in Navigator’s attractiveness as a platform, they also reflected the substantial impact of Microsoft’s actions.</span></p><p><span>363.The “hit” data collected by AdKnowledge comport with the share estimates on which Microsoft and AOL relied internally.  AdKnowledge is a company that markets Web advertising services.  Once the proprietor of a Web site sells space on its pages to an advertiser, AdKnowledge stores the advertisements on its servers and delivers them to the appropriate pages when they are accessed by users.  One day every month, AdKnowledge monitors the number of times that each of the advertisements appears on users’ screens.  Each appearance of an advertisement on a user’s screen is called a “hit.”  As part of the hit data it collects, AdKnowledge logs the type of Web browsing software used to access the pages on which the particular advertisements appear.  Thus, the AdKnowledge data can be used to calculate monthly snapshots of the shares of usage that particular types of Web browsing software attract from the population of users accessing the Web pages that AdKnowledge monitors.  To the extent AdKnowledge can detect the IAPs through which individual users access the monitored sites, the data can also be used to calculate estimates of the usage shares that particular types of browsing software attract from the subscriber bases of particular IAPs.</span></p><p><span>364.The AdKnowledge data show that Internet Explorer’s share of hits to the monitored Web sites rose from twenty percent in January 1997 to forty-nine percent in August 1998 and that Navigator’s share fell from seventy-seven to forty-eight percent over the same period.  Dividing the change in the respective numbers of Internet Explorer and Navigator hits from the first quarter of 1998 to the third quarter of 1998 by the change in the number of total hits over that same period yields a fifty-seven percent share of incremental browser usage for Internet Explorer and a forty percent share for Navigator.  These figures are again consistent with the estimates on which Microsoft and AOL relied internally.</span></p><p><span>365.When a user accessing the Internet through AOL moves from one Web page to another, AOL temporarily stores, or “caches,” the first Web page on a local server.  When the subscriber seeks to return to the first page, AOL delivers it from the local server rather than returning to the Web for a refreshed version of the page.  AdKnowledge only counts a hit when one of the monitored advertisements is served to a users’ computer from the Web.  Thus, AdKnowledge undercounts hits by AOL users.  AdKnowledge’s attempt to implement “cache-</span></p><p><span>fooling” measures has not eliminated the effects of caching.  Largely as a result of the restrictive terms Microsoft prevailed upon AOL to accept, Internet Explorer enjoys a very high share of browser usage by AOL subscribers.  Consequently, Internet Explorer’s share of all hits detected by AdKnowledge is lower than its actual share of all usage.  Correcting for the effects of caching results in virtually no change to the AdKnowledge-based calculation of relative browser usage shares in early 1997; however, it raises by approximately five percent the figure representing Internet Explorer’s share of browser usage in the third quarter of 1998.</span></p><p><span>366.Although AdKnowledge only monitors hits to commercial Web pages, there is no indication that certain types of Web browsing software are used more than others to access commercial, versus non-commercial Web sites.  Furthermore, the same share trends reflected in the AdKnowledge data appear in data collected from a prominent academic site.  The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champlain monitors, on a weekly basis, the browsing software accessing its popular engineering Web site.  The resulting data, which AOL found important enough to rely on in evaluating the purchase of Netscape, yield virtually the same usage share figures as do the AdKnowledge data.</span></p><p><span>367.AdKnowledge does not undertake to collect data on the use of browsing software to navigate proprietary OLS content or intra-enterprise networks (“intranets”).  This does not detract from the value of the AdKnowledge data as a measure of usage share for developers’ purposes, however, for most developers of network-centric applications look to write applications that will run through Web sites, not through OLS proprietary content or pages on an intranet.  Most developers will therefore pay most attention to estimates of the extent to which a particular type of browsing software is being used to browse the Web.  Moreover, only a very small percentage of the copies of Web browsing software in operation are used exclusively to navigate intranets.</span></p><p><span>368.The advertisement banners on some Web sites alternate between different advertisements.  Assuming that AdKnowledge delivers these advertisements, a single visit to a Web site could register with AdKnowledge as multiple hits as the advertisements “rotate” on the user’s screen.  This phenomenon does not spoil the essential reliability of the AdKnlowledge data as a reporter of browser usage share, though.  In order for there to be a bias of significant proportions, users of either Internet Explorer or Navigator would have to exhibit a special propensity to keep pages open as the advertisements rotate.  There is no reason to believe that this is the case.  </span></p><p><span> 369.Thus none of the characteristics of the AdKnowledge data invalidate it as a useful measure of browser usage share.  It is understandable, therefore, that in evaluating the purchase of Netscape, AOL viewed AdKnowledge’s hit data as one of the more reliable indicators of trends in the relative shares of all browser usage enjoyed by Navigator and Internet Explorer.</span></p><p><span>370.Microsoft’s economic witness, Richard Schmalensee, testified survey data collected by Market Decisions Corporation (“MDC”) provide a more accurate measure of the usage shares enjoyed by different brands of Web browsing software than AdKnowledge’s hit data.  The calculations that Schmalensee made using the MDC data lead to results that differ, in one main respect, from the results generated with hit data.  Whereas the AdKnowledge data show Navigator’s share falling from seventy-five to fifty-six percent from the first to the third quarter of 1997, the MDC data show Navigator’s share holding steady at fifty-five or fifty-six percent over the same period.  Although both sources show Internet Explorer’s share gaining steadily throughout that period, the MDC data indicate that Internet Explorer’s rise was coming not at Navigator’s expense, but rather at the expense of other browser products, which, according to the MDC data, collectively enjoyed a substantial share into 1997.  The AdKnowledge data, by contrast, indicate that the share of usage attributable to browsers other than Internet Explorer and Navigator has never been substantial and that Internet Explorer’s rise has always been at Navigator’s expense.</span></p><p><span>371.The MDC estimates of the shares attributable to Navigator and other non-</span></p><p><span>Microosft browser products in 1996 differ markedly from those on which Microsoft and AOL relied in the course of making business judgments.  Notably, in August 1996, four months after it commissioned the first MDC survey, Microsoft continued to estimate Navigator’s share as exceeding eighty percent.  In fact, the senior Microsoft executives who testified in this trial still believed at the time of their testimony that Navigator’s usage share in late 1995 and early 1996 had exceeded eighty percent.  To the extent the MDC estimates differ from those which Microsoft and AOL used internally, and which senior Microsoft executives still embrace, the Court is inclined to trust the latter estimates.  More broadly, the sets of questions contained in the MDC surveys and the internally inconsistent responses they evoked reveal that a substantial percentage of the respondents misunderstood some of the patently ambiguous questions they were asked, and that a large number responded to questions when they were unsure of, or even clearly misinformed regarding, the answers.  The Court accordingly gives no weight to any of the conclusions that Microsoft draws from MDC survey data.</span></p><p><span>372.In summary, the estimates on which Microsoft and AOL relied and the measurements made by AdKnowledge and the University of Illinois provide an adequate basis for two findings:  First, from early 1996 to the late summer of 1998, Navigator’s share of all browser usage fell from above seventy percent to around fifty percent, while Internet Explorer’s share rose from about five percent to around fifty percent; second, by 1998, Navigator’s share of incremental browser usage had fallen below forty percent while Internet Explorer’s share had risen above sixty percent.  All signs point to the fact that Internet Explorer’s share has continued to rise — and Navigator’s has continued to decline — since the late summer of 1998.  It is safe to conclude, then, that Internet Explorer’s share of all browser usage now exceeds fifty percent, and that Navigator’s share has fallen below that mark.</span></p><p><span>373.These trends will continue.  In February 1998, Kumar Mehta, the Microsoft employee responsible for tracking browser share, told Brad Chase that Microsoft’s best model projected that Internet Explorer’s usage share in early 2001 would stand between sixty and sixty-</span></p><p><span>eight percent.  This comports with the forecast on which AOL relied in deciding to purchase Netscape:  The report presented to AOL’s board of directors prior to their vote on the transaction predicted that Navigator’s usage share would fall to between thirty-five and forty percent by late 2000.  The most reasonable prediction, then, is that by January 2001, Internet Explorer’s usage share will exceed sixty percent while Navigator’s share will have fallen below forty percent.</span></p><p><span>374.Navigator’s large and continuing decline in usage share has demonstrated to developers the product’s failure to mature as the standard software used to browse the Web.  Internet Explorer’s success in gaining usage share, together with the lack of contenders other than Navigator, has simultaneously sent the clear message to developers that no platform for network-</span></p><p><span>centric applications can compete for ubiquity with the 32-bit Windows API set.</span></p><p><span>2.The Cause of the Change in Usage Shares</span></p><p><span>375.The changes in usage share described above would likely not have occurred had Microsoft not improved its browsing software to the point that, by late 1996, the average user could not discern a significant difference in quality and features between the latest versions of Internet Explorer and Navigator.  As Microsoft’s top executives predicted, however, Internet Explorer’s quality and features have never surpassed Navigator’s to such a degree as to compel a significant part of Navigator’s installed base to switch to Internet Explorer.  An internal Microsoft presentation concluded in February 1998 that “[m]any customers see MS and NS as parity products; no strong reason to switch,” and another internal review three months later reported, “IE4 is fundamentally not compelling” and “[n]ot differentiated from Netscape v[ersion]4 — seen as a commodity.”  For a time, even among new users, Navigator was likely to win most choices between comparable browser software, because most people associated the Internet and cutting-</span></p><p><span>edge browsing technology with Netscape rather than with Microsoft.  So, if Microsoft had taken no action other than improving the quality and features of its browser, Internet Explorer’s share of usage would have risen far less and far more slowly than it actually did.  While Internet Explorer’s increase in usage share accelerated and began to cut deeply into Navigator’s share after Microsoft released the first version of Internet Explorer (3.0) to offer quality and features approaching those of Navigator, the acceleration occurred months before Microsoft released the first version of Internet Explorer (4.0) to win a significant number of head-to-head product reviews against Navigator.  This indicates that superior quality was not responsible for the dramatic rise Internet Explorer’s usage share.</span></p><p><span>376.Including Internet Explorer with Windows at no additional charge likely helped the usage share of Microsoft’s browsing software.  It did not, however, prevent OEMs from meeting demand for Navigator, which remained higher than demand for Internet Explorer well into 1998.  Moreover, bundling Internet Explorer with Windows had no effect on the distribution and promotion of browsing software by IAPs or through any of the other channels that Microsoft sought to pre-empt by other means.  Had Microsoft not offered distribution licenses for Internet Explorer — and other things of great value — to other firms at no charge; had it not prevented OEMs from removing the prominent means of accessing Internet Explorer and limited their ability to feature Navigator; and had Microsoft not taken all the other measures it used to maximize Internet Explorer’s usage share at Navigator’s expense, its browsing software would not have weaned such a large amount of usage share from Navigator, much less overtaken Navigator in three years.</span></p><p><span>I.The Success of Microsoft’s Effort to</span><span/><span>Protect the Applications Barrier to Entry from the Threat Posed by Navigator</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>377.In late 1995 and early 1996, Navigator seemed well on its way to becoming the standard software for browsing the Web.  Within three years, however, Microsoft had successfully denied Navigator that status, and had thereby forestalled a serious potential threat to the applications barrier to entry.  Indeed, Microsoft’s Kumar Mehta felt comfortable expressing to Brad Chase in February 1998 his “PERSONAL opinion” that “the browser battle is close to over.”  Mehta continued: “We set out on this mission 2 years ago to not let netscape dictate standards and control the browser api’s [</span><span>sic</span><span>].  All evidence today says they don’t.”</span></p><p><span>378.The population of browser users is expanding so quickly that Navigator’s installed base has grown even as its usage share has fallen.  In fact, AOL credited an estimate stating that Navigator’s installed base in the United States alone grew from fifteen million in 1996 to thirty-</span></p><p><span>three million in December 1998.  By all indications, Navigator’s installed base will continue to grow.  This does not mean, however, that Navigator is — or will be — an attractive enough platform for the development of network-centric applications to weaken the applications barrier to entry.  As discussed above, the APIs that Navigator exposes could only attract enough developer attention to threaten the applications barrier to entry if Navigator became — or appeared destined to become — the standard software used to browse the Web.  Navigator’s installed base may continue to grow, but Internet Explorer’s installed base is now larger and growing faster.  Consequently, the APIs that Navigator exposes will not attract enough developer attention to spawn a body of cross-platform, network-centric applications large enough to dismantle the applications barrier to entry.</span></p><p><span>379.Not only did Microsoft prevent Navigator from undermining the applications barrier to entry, it inflicted considerable harm on Netscape’s business in the process.  By ensuring that the firms comprising the channels that lead most efficiently to browser usage distributed and promoted Internet Explorer to the virtual exclusion of Navigator, Microsoft relegated Netscape to more costly and less effective methods of distributing and promoting its browsing software.  After Microsoft started licensing Internet Explorer at no charge, not only to OEMs and consumers, but also to IAPs, ISVs, ICPs, and even Apple, Netscape was forced to follow suit.  Despite the fact that it did not charge for Internet Explorer, Microsoft could still defray the massive costs it was undertaking to maximize usage share with the vast profits earned licensing Windows.  Because Netscape did not have that luxury, it could ill afford the dramatic drop in revenues from Navigator, much less to pay for the inefficient modes of distribution to which Microsoft had consigned it.  The financial constraints also deterred Netscape from undertaking technical innovations that it might otherwise have implemented in Navigator.  Microsoft was not altogether surprised, then, when it learned in November 1998 that Netscape had surrendered itself to acquisition by another company.  </span></p><p><span>380.Were AOL ever to attempt to revive Navigator’s usage share with the intention of building it into a significant platform for the development of network-centric applications, that effort would not make any headway before January 1, 2001, when AOL’s obligation to distribute Internet Explorer on a preferential basis expires.  In fact, there is presently no indication that AOL will try even after that date to raise Navigator’s usage share substantially.  First of all, as explained above, AOL need not revive Navigator’s usage share in order to achieve an adequate return on its investment in Netscape.  Secondly, while the due-diligence summary and board-of-</span></p><p><span>directors presentation that preceded the Netscape acquisition discuss AOL’s commitment to invest marketing resources in an effort to stem the slide in Navigator’s share, neither report indicates any intention on AOL’s part to invest in actually raising Navigator’s share.</span></p><p><span>381.Also detracting from the notion that AOL is committed to reviving the middleware threat through Navigator is the fact that AOL included in the November 1998 agreement with Sun a provision making clear that the new partnership with Sun in no way obligated AOL to drop Internet Explorer from its client software in favor of Navigator.  The provision states that “AOL has no present intention to make any such replacement or use and shall have no obligation to make any such replacement or use, and that it is AOL’s present expectation that it . . . may seek to renew and/or extend and expand its present agreement with Microsoft Corporation to continue to distribute Internet Explorer.”</span></p><p><span>382.Bill Gates himself, who is not one to underestimate threats to Microsoft’s business, apparently concluded after reviewing the November 1998 transactions that AOL would not seek to develop a platform that would compete with Microsoft’s network-centric interfaces.  In December 1998, during a meeting convened to analyze the implications of the AOL/Netscape/Sun transactions, Gates declared to the assembled Microsoft executives, “AOL doesn’t have it in their genes to attack us in the platform space.”</span></p><p><span>383.Finally, if its coveted placement in the Online Services Folder fails to entice AOL into extending its agreement with Microsoft past January 2001, Microsoft assuredly has the wherewithal to offer AOL additional inducements in exchange for yet more commitments that will preclude a resurgence of Navigator’s usage share.  Even if, despite the absence of signs to that effect, AOL drops Internet Explorer and adopts Navigator with a mind to reviving Navigator’s usage share after January 1, 2001, Navigator’s transformation into a platform attractive enough to threaten the applications barrier would be a chimerical aspiration, especially considering Microsoft’s increasing influence over network-centric standards.  In any event, nothing that happens after January 1, 2001 will change the fact that Microsoft has succeeded in forestalling for several years Navigator’s evolution in that direction.</span></p><p><span>384.Although the suspicion lingers, the evidence is insufficient to find that Microsoft’s ambition is a future in which most or all of the content available on the Web would be accessible only through its own browsing software.  The evidence does, however, reveal an intent to ensure that if and when full-featured, server-based applications begin appearing in large numbers on the Web, the number of them relying solely on middleware APIs (such as those exposed by Navigator) will be too few to attenuate the applications barrier to entry.  </span></p><p><span>385.At least partly because of Navigator’s substantial usage share, most developers continue to insist that their Web content be more-or-less as attractive when accessed with Navigator as it is when accessed with Internet Explorer.  Navigator will retain an appreciable usage share through the end of 2000.  After that point, AOL may be able and willing to prevent Internet Explorer’s share from achieving such dominance that a critical mass of developers will cease to concern themselves with ensuring that their Web content at least be accessible through non-Microsoft browsing software.  So, as matters stand at present, while Microsoft has succeeded in forestalling the development of enough full-featured, cross-platform, network-centric applications to render the applications barrier penetrable, it is not likely to drive non-Microsoft PC Web browsing software from the marketplace altogether.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>VI.MICROSOFT’S RESPONSE TO THE THREAT POSED BY SUN’S IMPLEMENTATION OF JAVA</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>386.For Microsoft, a key to maintaining and reinforcing the applications barrier to entry has been preserving the difficulty of porting applications from Windows to other platforms, and vice versa.  In 1996, senior executives at Microsoft became aware that the number of developers writing network-centric applications in the Java programming language had become significant, and that Java was likely to increase in popularity among developers.  Microsoft therefore became interested in maximizing the difficulty with which applications written in Java could be ported from Windows to other platforms, and vice versa.</span></p><p><span>A.Creating a Java Implementation for Windows that Undermined Portability and Was Incompatible with Other Implementations</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>387.Although Sun intended Java technologies eventually to allow developers to write applications that would run on multiple operating systems without any porting, the Java class libraries have never exposed enough APIs to support full-featured applications.  Java developers have thus always needed to rely on platform-specific APIs in order to write applications with advanced functionality.  Recognizing this, Sun sponsored a process for the creation of a software method that would allow developers writing in Java to rely directly upon APIs exposed by a particular operating system in a way that would nevertheless allow them to port their applications with relative ease to JVMs running on different operating systems.</span></p><p><span>388.On March 12, 1996, Sun signed an agreement granting Microsoft the right to distribute and make certain modifications to Sun’s Java technologies.  Microsoft used this license to create its own Java development tools and its own Windows-compatible Java runtime environment.  Because the motivation behind the Sun-sponsored effort ran counter to Microsoft’s interest in preserving the difficulty of porting, Microsoft independently developed methods for enabling “calls” to “native” Windows code that made porting more difficult than the method that Sun was striving to make standard.  Microsoft implemented these different methods in its developer tools and in its JVM.  Microsoft also discouraged its business allies from aiding Sun’s effort.  For example, Gates told Intel’s CEO in June 1996 that he did not want the Intel Architecture Labs cooperating with Sun to develop methods for calling upon multimedia interfaces in Windows.  </span></p><p><span>389.Since they were custom-built for enabling native calls to Windows, and because they were developed by the firm with the most intimate knowledge of Windows, the native methods that Microsoft produced were slightly easier for developers to use than the method that derived from the Sun-sponsored effort, and Java applications using Microsoft’s methods tended to run faster than ones calling upon Windows APIs with Sun’s method.  If a developer relied on Microsoft’s methods rather than Sun’s, however, his Java application would be much more difficult to port from the Windows-compatible JVM to JVMs designed to run on different operating systems.  </span></p><p><span>390.Microsoft easily could have implemented Sun’s native method along with its own in its developer tools and its JVM, thereby allowing Java developers to choose between speed and portability; however, it elected instead to implement only the Microsoft methods.  The result was that if a Java developer used the Sun method for making native calls, his application would not run on Microsoft’s version of the Windows JVM, and if he used Microsoft’s native methods, his application would not run on any JVM other than Microsoft’s version.  Far from being the unintended consequence of an attempt to help Java developers more easily develop high-performing applications, incompatibility was the intended result of Microsoft’s efforts.  In fact, Microsoft would subsequently threaten to use the same tactic against Apple’s QuickTime.  Microsoft continued to refuse to implement Sun’s native method until November 1998, when a court ordered it to do so.  It then took Microsoft only a few weeks to implement Sun’s native method in its developer tools and JVM.</span></p><p><span>391.Although the Java class libraries have yet to provide enough functionality to support full-featured applications, they have gradually expanded toward that goal.  In 1997, Sun added a class library called Remote Method Invocation, or “RMI,” which allowed Java applications written to call upon it to communicate with each other in certain useful ways.  Microsoft was not willing to stand by and allow Java developers to rely on new Java class libraries unimpeded.  The more that Java developers were able to satisfy their need for functionality by calling upon the Java class libraries, the more portable their applications would become.  Microsoft had developed a set of Windows-specific interfaces to provide functionality analogous to the functionality RMI offered; it wanted Java developers to rely on this Windows-specific technology rather than Sun’s cross-platform interface.  Microsoft thus refused to include RMI as a standard component of the Java runtime environment for Windows that it shipped with Internet Explorer 4.0.</span></p><p><span>392.The license agreement it had signed with Sun the previous year obligated Microsoft to offer RMI, at a minimum, on its developer Web site.  Microsoft did so, but with respect to the RMI beta release, it buried the link in an obscure location and neglected to include an entry for it in the site’s index.  Referring to RMI and any Java developers who might access Microsoft’s site looking for it, a Microsoft employee wrote to his approving manager, “They’ll have to stumble across it to know it’s there. . . . I’d say it’s pretty buried.”</span></p><p><span>393.It is unclear whether Microsoft ultimately placed RMI in a more prominent place on its developer Web site.  Even if it did, the fact that RMI was not shipped with Microsoft’s Java runtime environment for Windows meant that Java developers could not rely on its being installed on consumers’ PC systems.  If developers wanted their Java applications to call upon communications interfaces guaranteed to be present on Windows users’ systems, they had no choice but to rely on the Microsoft-specific interfaces instead of RMI.  Microsoft undertook the effort to remove RMI from the rest of the Java class libraries, instead of simply leaving it in place and allowing developers to choose between it and Windows-specific interfaces, for the sole purpose of making it more difficult for Java developers to write easily portable applications.</span></p><p><span>394.In a further effort intended to increase the incompatibility between Java applications written for its Windows JVM and other Windows JVMs, and to increase the difficulty of porting Java applications from the Windows environment to other platforms, Microsoft designed its Java developer tools to encourage developers to write their Java applications using certain “keywords” and “compiler directives” that could only be executed properly by Microsoft’s version of the Java runtime environment for Windows.  Microsoft encouraged developers to use these extensions by shipping its developer tools with the extensions enabled by default and by failing to warn developers that their use would result in applications that might not run properly with any runtime environment other than Microsoft’s and that would be difficult, and perhaps impossible, to port to JVMs running on other platforms.  This action comported with the suggestion that Microsoft’s Thomas Reardon made to his colleagues in November 1996: “[W]e should just quietly grow j++ [Microsoft’s developer tools] share and assume that people will take more advantage of our classes without ever realizing they are building win32-only java apps.”  Microsoft refused to alter its developer tools until November 1998, when a court ordered it to disable its keywords and compiler directives by default and to warn developers that using Microsoft’s Java extensions would likely cause incompatibilities with non-Microsoft runtime environments.</span></p><p><span>B.Inducing Developers to Use the Microsoft Implementation of Java Rather than Sun-Compliant Implementations</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>395.If all Microsoft had done to combat the growth of easily portable Java applications had been to increase the incompatibility between its Java implementation and ones complying with Sun’s standards, the effect might have been limited.   For if Sun could have assured developers that a Windows-compatible Java runtime environment that complied with Sun’s standards would be installed on as many Windows PCs as Microsoft’s version, and that it would run Java applications as well as Microsoft’s, developers might have considered the cost in portability associated with relying on Microsoft-specific technologies and instead written their Java applications using Sun’s developer tools.  When Netscape announced in May 1995 that it would include with every copy of Navigator a copy of a Windows JVM that complied with Sun’s standards, it appeared that Sun’s Java implementation would achieve the necessary ubiquity on Windows.  </span></p><p><span>396.Determined to induce developers to write Java applications that relied on its version of the runtime environment for Windows rather than on Sun-compliant ones, Microsoft made a large investment of engineering resources to develop a high-performance Windows JVM.  This made Microsoft’s version of the runtime environment attractive on its technical merits.  To hinder Sun and Netscape from improving the quality of the Windows JVM shipped with Navigator, Microsoft pressured Intel, which was developing a high-performance Windows-</span></p><p><span>compatible JVM, to not share its work with either Sun or Netscape, much less allow Netscape to bundle the Intel JVM with Navigator.  Gates was himself involved in this effort.  During the August 2, 1995 meeting at which he urged Intel to halt IAL’s development of platform-level software, Gates also announced that Intel’s cooperation with Sun and Netscape to develop a Java runtime environment for systems running on Intel’s microprocessors was one of the issues threatening to undermine cooperation between Intel and Microsoft.  By the spring of 1996, Intel had developed a JVM designed to run well on Intel-based systems while complying with Sun’s cross-platform standards.  Microsoft executives approached Intel in April of that year and urged that Intel not take any steps toward allowing Netscape to ship this JVM with Navigator.  </span></p><p><span>397.By bundling its version of the Windows JVM with every copy of Internet Explorer and expending some of its surplus monopoly power to maximize the usage of Internet Explorer at Navigator’s expense, Microsoft endowed its Java runtime environment with the unique attribute of guaranteed, enduring ubiquity across the enormous Windows installed base.  As one internal Microsoft presentation from January 1997 put it, the company’s response to cross-platform Java entailed “[i]ncreased IE share — integrat[ion] with Windows.”  Partly as a result of the damage that Microsoft’s efforts against Navigator inflicted on Netscape’s business, Netscape decided in 1998 that it could no longer afford to do the engineering work necessary to continue bundling up-</span></p><p><span>to-date JVMs with Navigator.  Consequently, it announced that, starting with version 5.0, Navigator would cease to be a distribution vehicle for JVMs compliant with Sun’s standards.</span></p><p><span>398.The guaranteed presence of Microsoft’s runtime environment on every Windows PC and the decreasing likelihood that the primary host of the Sun-compliant runtime environment (Navigator) would be present, induced many Java developers to write their applications using Microsoft’s developer tools, for doing so guaranteed that those applications would run in the Java environment most likely to be installed on a Windows user’s PC.  Owing to Microsoft’s deliberate design decisions, more developers using Microsoft’s Java developer tools meant that more Java applications would rely on the Windows-specific technologies in Microsoft’s runtime environment and thus would not be portable.</span></p><p><span>399.Microsoft was not content to rely solely on its anti-Navigator efforts to ensure that its Java runtime environment would be the only one guaranteed to be present on Windows PC systems.  After all, Netscape was not the only ISV capable of placing copies of a runtime environment on users’ systems.  Many developers of network-centric applications were just as capable of bundling compatible runtime environments with their applications as they were of bundling browsing software.  If the right runtime environment already came bundled with the right browsing software, all the more convenient for the ISV.  If not (as would increasingly be the case after Netscape stopped bundling a runtime environment with Navigator), though, the ISV could still separately obtain the desired runtime environment and bundle it with every copy of its product.  </span></p><p><span>400.Recognizing ISVs as a channel through which Java runtime environments that complied with Sun’s standards could find their way onto Windows PC systems, Microsoft induced ISVs to distribute Microsoft’s version instead of a Sun-compliant one.  First, Microsoft made its JVM available to ISVs separately from Internet Explorer so that those uninterested in bundling browsing software could nevertheless bundle Microsoft’s JVM.  Microsoft’s David Cole revealed the motivation for this step in a message he wrote to Jim Allchin in July 1997: “[W]e’ve agreed that we must allow ISVs to redistribute the Java VM standalone, without IE.  ISVs that do this are bound into Windows because that’s the only place the VM works, and it keeps them away from Sun’s APIs.”  </span></p><p><span>401.Microsoft took the further step of offering valuable things to ISVs that agreed to use Microsoft’s Java implementation.  Specifically, in the First Wave agreements that it signed with dozens of ISVs in 1997 and 1998, Microsoft conditioned early Windows 98 and Windows NT betas, other technical information, and the right to use certain Microsoft seals of approval on the agreement of those ISVs to use Microsoft’s version of the Windows JVM as the “default.”  Microsoft and the ISVs all read this requirement to obligate the ISVs to ensure that their Java applications were compatible with Microsoft’s version of the Windows JVM.  The only effective way to ensure compatibility with Microsoft’s JVM was to use Microsoft’s Java developer tools, which in turn meant using Microsoft’s methods for making native calls and (unless the developers were especially wary and sophisticated) Microsoft’s other Java extensions.  Thus, a very large percentage of the Java applications that the First Wave ISVs wrote would run only on Microsoft’s version of the Windows JVM.  With that in mind, the First Wave ISVs would not have any reason to distribute with their Java applications any JVM other than Microsoft’s.  So, in exchange for costly technical support and other blandishments, Microsoft induced dozens of important ISVs to make their Java applications reliant on Windows-specific technologies and to refrain from distributing to Windows users JVMs that complied with Sun’s standards.  The record contains no evidence that the relevant provision in the First Wave agreements had any purpose other than to maximize the difficulty of porting Java applications between Windows and other platforms.  Microsoft remained free to hold the First Wave ISVs to this provision until a court enjoined its enforcement in November 1998.</span></p><p><span>402.In addition to the First Wave agreements, Microsoft entered an agreement with at least one ISV that explicitly required it to redistribute Microsoft’s JVM to the exclusion of any other and to rely upon Microsoft’s native methods to the exclusion of any other methods.  Such agreements were also prohibited by the November 1998 injunction.</span></p><p><span>403.Microsoft anticipated that the Java language would become a popular medium in the multimedia arena.  It thus wanted to ensure that the Java software created to deliver multimedia content would not rely on Java implementations that fostered portability.  RealNetworks developed the most popular software for the creation and play-back of streaming multimedia content.  Therefore, Microsoft sought to ensure that, to the extent Java developers relied on RealNetworks’ technologies, they would not be relying on a Java implementation that complied with Sun’s standards.  So, in the July 18, 1997 agreement that it entered with RealNetworks, Microsoft conditioned its agreement to distribute RealNetworks’ media player with Internet Explorer on RealNetworks’ agreement to exert its best efforts to ensure that its player primarily use Windows-specific technology, rather than any analogous interfaces that Sun or Netscape might develop, to display multimedia content.  Absent this obligation, there would have been no technical reason why RealNetworks could not have designed its media player to support both Microsoft’s technologies and ones developed by Sun or Netscape.  Although RealNetworks subsequently announced that it planned to continue developing its own fundamental streaming software, the July 18 agreement limited the extent to which that software would include Java technologies that complied with Sun’s standards.</span></p><p><span>C.Thwarting the Expansion of the Java Class Libraries</span></p><p><span>404.As discussed above, Microsoft’s effort to lock developers into its Windows-</span></p><p><span>specific Java implementation included actions designed to discourage developers from taking advantage of Java class libraries such as RMI.  Microsoft went further than that, however.  In pursuit of its goal of minimizing the portability of Java applications, Microsoft took steps to thwart the very creation of cross-platform Java interfaces.  The incorporation of greater functionality into the Java class libraries would have increased the portability of the applications that relied on them, while simultaneously encouraging developers to use Sun-compliant implementations of Java.  In one instance of this effort to stunt the growth of the Java class libraries, Microsoft used threats to withhold Windows operating-system support from Intel’s microprocessors and offers to include Intel technology in Windows in order to induce Intel to stop aiding Sun in the development of Java classes that would support innovative multimedia functionality.</span></p><p><span>405.In November 1995, Microsoft’s Paul Maritz told a senior Intel executive that Intel’s optimization of its multimedia software for Sun’s Java standards was as inimical to Microsoft as Microsoft’s support for non-Intel microprocessors would be to Intel.  It was not until 1997, though, that Microsoft prevailed upon Intel to not support Sun’s development of Java classes that would have allowed developers to include certain multimedia features in their Java applications without sacrificing portability.  </span></p><p><span>406.In February 1997, one of Intel’s competitors, called AMD, solicited support from Microsoft for its “3DX” technology, which provided sophisticated multimedia support for games.  Microsoft’s Allchin asked Gates whether Microsoft should support 3DX, despite the fact that Intel would oppose it.  Gates responded: “If Intel has a real problem with us supporting this then they will have to stop supporting Java Multimedia the way they are.  I would gladly give up supporting this if they would back off from their work on JAVA which is terrible for Intel.”  Near the end of March, Allchin sent another message to Gates and Maritz.  In it he wrote, “I am positive that we must do a direct attack on Sun (and probably Oracle). . . . Between ourselves and our partners, we can certainly hurt their (certainly Sun’s) revenue base. . . . We need to get Intel to help us.  Today, they are not.”  Two months later, Eric Engstrom, a Microsoft executive with responsibility for multimedia development, wrote to his superiors that one of Microsoft’s goals was getting “Intel to stop helping Sun create Java Multimedia APIs, especially ones that run well (ie native implementations) on Windows.”  Engstrom proposed achieving this goal by offering Intel the following deal:  Microsoft would incorporate into the Windows API set any multimedia interfaces that Intel agreed to not help Sun incorporate into the Java class libraries.  Engstrom’s efforts apparently bore fruit, for he testified at trial that Intel’s IAL subsequently stopped helping Sun to develop class libraries that offered cutting-edge multimedia support.</span></p><p><span>D.The Effect of Microsoft’s Efforts to Prevent Java from Diminishing the Applications Barrier to Entry</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>407.Had Microsoft not been committed to protecting and enhancing the applications barrier to entry, it might still have developed a high-performance JVM and enabled Java developers to call upon Windows APIs.  Absent this commitment, though, Microsoft would not have taken efforts to maximize the difficulty of porting Java applications written to its implementation and to drastically limit the ability of developers to write Java applications that would run in both Microsoft’s version of the Windows runtime environment and versions complying with Sun’s standards.  Nor would Microsoft have endeavored to limit Navigator’s usage share, to induce ISVs to neither use nor distribute non-Microsoft Java technologies, and to impede the expansion of the Java class libraries, had it not been determined to discourage developers from writing applications that would be easy to port between Windows and other platforms.  Microsoft’s dedication to the goal of protecting the applications barrier to entry is highlighted by the fact that its efforts to create incompatibility between its JVM and others resulted in fewer applications being able to run on Windows than otherwise would have.  Microsoft felt it was worth obstructing the development of Windows-compatible applications where those applications would have been easy to port to other platforms.  It is not clear whether, absent Microsoft’s interference, Sun’s Java efforts would by now have facilitated porting between Windows and other platforms enough to weaken the applications barrier to entry.  What is clear, however, is that Microsoft has succeeded in greatly impeding Java’s progress to that end with a series of actions whose sole purpose and effect were to do precisely that.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span/></p><p><span>VII.THE EFFECT ON CONSUMERS OF MICROSOFT’S EFFORTS TO PROTECT THE APPLICATIONS BARRIER TO ENTRY</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span>408.The debut of Internet Explorer and its rapid improvement gave Netscape an incentive to improve Navigator’s quality at a competitive rate.  The inclusion of Internet Explorer with Windows at no separate charge increased general familiarity with the Internet and reduced the cost to the public of gaining access to it, at least in part because it compelled Netscape to stop charging for Navigator.  These actions thus contributed to improving the quality of Web browsing software, lowering its cost, and increasing its availability, thereby benefitting consumers.</span></p><p><span>409.To the detriment of consumers, however, Microsoft has done much more than develop innovative browsing software of commendable quality and offer it bundled with Windows at no additional charge.  As has been shown, Microsoft also engaged in a concerted series of actions designed to protect the applications barrier to entry, and hence its monopoly power, from a variety of middleware threats, including Netscape’s Web browser and Sun’s implementation of Java.  Many of these actions have harmed consumers in ways that are immediate and easily discernible.  They have also caused less direct, but nevertheless serious and far-reaching, consumer harm by distorting competition.</span></p><p><span>410.By refusing to offer those OEMs who requested it a version of Windows without Web browsing software, and by preventing OEMs from removing Internet Explorer — or even the most obvious means of invoking it — prior to shipment, Microsoft forced OEMs to ignore consumer demand for a browserless version of Windows.  The same actions forced OEMs either to ignore consumer preferences for Navigator or to give them a Hobson’s choice of both browser products at the cost of increased confusion, degraded system performance, and restricted memory.  By ensuring that Internet Explorer would launch in certain circumstances in Windows 98 even if Navigator were set as the default, and even if the consumer had removed all conspicuous means of invoking Internet Explorer, Microsoft created confusion and frustration for consumers, and increased technical support costs for business customers.  Those Windows purchasers who did not want browsing software — businesses, or parents and teachers, for example, concerned with the potential for irresponsible Web browsing on PC systems — not only had to undertake the effort necessary to remove the visible means of invoking Internet Explorer and then contend with the fact that Internet Explorer would nevertheless launch in certain cases; they also had to (assuming they needed new, non-browsing features not available in earlier versions of Windows) content themselves with a PC system that ran slower and provided less available memory than if the newest version of Windows came without browsing software.  By constraining the freedom of OEMs to implement certain software programs in the Windows boot sequence, Microsoft foreclosed an opportunity for OEMs to make Windows PC systems less confusing and more user-friendly, as consumers desired.  By taking the actions listed above, and by enticing firms into exclusivity arrangements with valuable inducements that only Microsoft could offer and that the firms reasonably believed they could not do without, Microsoft forced those consumers who otherwise would have elected Navigator as their browser to either pay a substantial price (in the forms of downloading, installation, confusion, degraded system performance, and diminished memory capacity) or content themselves with Internet Explorer.  Finally, by pressuring Intel to drop the development of platform-level NSP software, and otherwise to cut back on its software development efforts, Microsoft deprived consumers of software innovation that they very well may have found valuable, had the innovation been allowed to reach the marketplace.  None of these actions had pro-competitive justifications.</span></p><p><span>411.Many of the tactics that Microsoft has employed have also harmed consumers indirectly by unjustifiably distorting competition.  The actions that Microsoft took against Navigator hobbled a form of innovation that had shown the potential to depress the applications barrier to entry sufficiently to enable other firms to compete effectively against Microsoft in the market for Intel-compatible PC operating systems.  That competition would have conduced to consumer choice and nurtured innovation.  The campaign against Navigator also retarded widespread acceptance of Sun’s Java implementation.  This campaign, together with actions that Microsoft took with the sole purpose of making it difficult for developers to write Java applications with technologies that would allow them to be ported between Windows and other platforms, impeded another form of innovation that bore the potential to diminish the applications barrier to entry.  There is insufficient evidence to find that, absent Microsoft’s actions, Navigator and Java already would have ignited genuine competition in the market for Intel-compatible PC operating systems.  It is clear, however, that Microsoft has retarded, and perhaps altogether extinguished, the process by which these two middleware technologies could have facilitated the introduction of competition into an important market.</span></p><p><span>412.Most harmful of all is the message that Microsoft’s actions have conveyed to every enterprise with the potential to innovate in the computer industry.  Through its conduct toward Netscape, IBM, Compaq, Intel, and others, Microsoft has demonstrated that it will use its prodigious market power and immense profits to harm any firm that insists on pursuing initiatives that could intensify competition against one of Microsoft’s core products.  Microsoft’s past success in hurting such companies and stifling innovation deters investment in technologies and businesses that exhibit the potential to threaten Microsoft.  The ultimate result is that some innovations that would truly benefit consumers never occur for the sole reason that they do not coincide with Microsoft’s self-interest.</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span/></p><p><span>___________/s/_______________</span></p><p><span>Thomas Penfield Jackson</span></p><p><span>U.S. District Judge</span></p><p><span/></p><p><span/></p><p><span/></p><p><span>Date:November 5, 1999</span></p>  ]]></content>

Mr. Kenneth Lay
Chairman
Enron Corporation
1440 Smith Street
Houston, Texas 77002

Dear Mr. Kenneth Lay:

This brief note concerns an innovative business development opportunity in
the rapidly expanding field of B2B eProcurement/e-commerce.  I am trying to
initiate a system to fully integrate an industry that is fragmented and in
need of adding scalable 'process' efficiencies.  This will require
substantial resources that are not available to me. These resources would be
less significant to a company like Enron Corporation.  However the upside
potential would, I believe, be significant to your corporation. The risk
reward ratio in this marketplace favors the upside potential significantly.
This market is ripe for innovation because of the fundamental need to
improve product and service delivery in a cost effective and timely manner.
The process has already begun but will require a critical mass player that
can deliver open-market eProcurement.  The process related savings alone
will be approximately $11 billion annual when an effective supply chain
system is implemented. The timing is critical since in the next 18- 36
months the winners and losers would have already lined up for success and
failure.  A linchpin is needed and it could well be Enron.  I have little
doubt that Enron could do the job and become the stand-alone leader in this
field.

I am writing to Enron Corporation to determine your potential interest in a
very large global marketplace that is poised for transformation and
transition.  This marketplace is currently valued in excess of $300 billion
annual worldwide with high profit margins as well as large continuing
revenue growth rates in excess of 10% annually. There are buy and sell side
opportunities for revenues as well as a transactional fee opportunity.

What I am proposing would be the critical next innovative step to enter a
new level of global sourcing, purchasing, risk management and distribution
for this industry.

I realize the vagueness and brevity of my comments but without an existing
level of confidentiality I cannot expand these thoughts.  If you have
interest in taking one additional step to determine if my strategic concept
has merit please let me know.

Best regards,

John Manfredonia

  <content name="title" action="cluster">Re: Clinton Energy Vacation Policy &amp; Request</content>
  <content type="text" name="message">I was disappointed,  to say the least, at the return email I received from you so I waited before replying so as not to react in haste. Previously I stuck to facts and did not bring things of a personal nature into the equation. I feel, however, that there are a few things you should know about me and how I have exemplified the ENRON VISION so you can realize why I took this so seriously and why am, to be blunt, ticked off at the resolution.
In the 4 years that I worked on the scheduling desk for Clinton I never missed a day of work.........not one.
I never took vacation during bid week or during tie out time.
Between 96 - 00 I took all but 3 days vacation between the months of May - October so as not to interfere with winter gas operations.
I have had nothing but above average reviews in the past 5 years,  been promoted twice, and received special recognition for working shorthanded through the winter of 99-00.
As you can see I have consistently put ENRON ahead of personal conveniences and strived to do the right thing for the company. I am distressed that the very values Enron holds me to ring hollow with regards to how I have been treated.
Changing vacation rules, be it legally legitimate, does not exemplify INTEGRITYin my eyes!
Not stating a policy change (THERE HAS STILL NEVER BEEN A FORMAL STATEMENT OF THIS CHANGE) does not illustrate COMMUNICATION!
Stating that I will be paid for vacation less any I take between now and the severance date is deceptive at the least and would not constitute RESPECT, EXCELLENCE nor INTEGRITY!
FACT - items 1 - 6 in the original email are 100% true. #2 is of the most significance as the words came from the lips of our HR representative that I would be paid the vacation amount we discussed UNLESS I TOOK ANY VACATION BETWEEN NOW AND JUNE 1st.
FACT - At least 2 people were allowed vacation time off during this transition (Susan Weison, Sheri Wallace)
FACT - If you check my vacation records you will find that I have taken a vacation EVERY YEAR IN MAY. My request was made, like in all previous years, a few weeks before I wanted to take it. HAD I KNOWN THAT THE RULES OF THE GAME WERE GOING TO BE CHANGED I WOULD HAVE MADE MY INTENTIONS KNOWN EARLIER.

In conclusion I do not expect, or even wish for a response. I have enjoyed my time with Clinton Energy and Enron. I have learned much and forwarded my career greatly and for that I am thankful. I just wanted you to know where I am coming from and how an unfortunate situation of severance was turned into one in which I leave being taught a lesson by Enron that does not make me a better person, just a smarter one. This lesson; a spotless record &amp; loyalty to a company means very little. It is better to look out for #1. In the end the company you work for is going to protect their best interests regardless of the rhetoric in their Vision Statement. Thank you for your time.

Respectfully,

Sean Zurbrick

Subject:	Re: Clinton Energy Vacation Policy &amp; Request   

Sean;

Thank you for bringing your concerns to us.  We value the input of our employees, and constantly seek ways to improve the quality of our employee benefits.  After talking to some of the parties involved in this matter and reviewing our vacation policy, we find that your management acted within the scope of its responsibility and within the bounds of our vacation policy.  In addition, we find no evidence of inconsistencies and believe that you and your co-workers at Clinton have been treated equitably and fairly regarding the denial of vacation during this transition period. 

In closing, we support the decision to deny vacation requests to the Clinton employees affected by this transition.  Should you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to direct them to your management

Subject:	Clinton Energy Vacation Policy &amp; Request

I have held discussions with Tim Weithman, Ashley Kerr &amp; Ken Brooks (immediate supervisor) regarding a request for vacation for the 3rd or 4th week in May. I have been told recently by both Ms. Kerr as well as Mr. Weithman that those of us being severed from the company are not permitted to take any vacation time between now and June 1st. It would seem that there are several inconsistencies regarding Enron policy as well as how the subject was presented both to the group as well as individually. Below are the inconsistencies I speak of.

During the group meeting in the beginning of April there was no mention of "vacation freezes". The only reference to time that was mentioned was that you must be employed by Enron as of June 1, 2001 to receive the severance package.
During my private discussion, in which both Ms. Kerr and Ms. Gray were present, I was presented with the specifics of the severance package. I specifically remember being asked for my current unused vacation amount. I gave them the amount of 152 hours and was told that I would be reimbursed for that total unless, of course, I took any additional vacation. This implied that regular Enron vacation policies would be in effect. Again, at no time was it presented to me that I was ineligible to take ANY of my earned vacation or that there would be any deviations from normal Enron policy regarding vacation.
At no time has Mr. Weithman, Ms. Gray, Ms. Kerr or any other Enron agent made public a policy of vacation freezes.
At no time were there ever any public or private requests that the plans for those with previously scheduled vacations to be made available to any Enron agent.
I can find nothing in my severance package that states any deviation from the standard Enron vacation policy.
I realize that Enron policy requires vacation approval from the supervising employee. It states in that policy the following:
"An employee's preference for scheduling vacation should be adopted when possible."
"The supervisor must verify that unit staffing needs are met before approving an employee's vacation request."
I am currently still an Enron employee.  I have also verified that staffing needs are met. 

In summary, as you can see there are several inconsistencies with regards to the vacation policy for those being severed at Clinton Energy. It more than offends me that I am being prohibited from taken ANY part of the 152 hours of accrued vacation that is, by all accounts, mine to take. This being said, I am formally requesting one last time that I be granted my vacation request during the month of May. Furthermore I would like this approval as soon as possible so that I may make necessary arrangements. As you review this I am consulting an attorney so that I may be advised of my rights regarding this matter.

Thank you,

Sean Zurbrick

  <content type="text" name="message">Steve Kean and I believe quite strongly, within a four peer group structure,  that we need to allocate somewhere between 30 and 50 percent of Gov't./ public  Affairs out of commercial support into specialized technical- there is a clear divide between individuals in the Gov't/public  Affairs groups  who are managing significant risk for the company and having a significant and  direct impact on commercial activities/ net income( these individuals should be moved to specialized technical)....and others who are performing a less strategic function( who should remain in the commercial support category). With that said, it is probably not necessary to undertake this effort for  mid-year PRC purposes since we are probably moving to a three peer stucture where that split could be achieved (for year-end purposes where the compensation impact would be felt). If we stay with the four group stucture, I intend to push hard for the remapping of Gov't Affairs by year-end.
    On a completely seperate issue, I continue to be  very concerned about the impact of the "preferred" distribution  relative to the bottom category for " commercial support" groups(I'm not implying this is'nt an issue for commercial groups- I just don't have the same ability to assess the impact there)....the concern, simply stated,  is that  it may be entirely  counterproductive to force individuals who are not performance problems  into a category that has significant implications for their careers here at Enron, particularly after going thru the past year where many of the non-performers in my group and others  were moved out of the company- the replacement costs for moving good performers out of the company for the sake of a "preferred" distribution are quite high...and that is even before you begin  to assess the incalcuable damage to morale that will invariably occour.
       Thanks.

Subject:	PEER GROUP MAPPING

Following my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group mapping for all business units. This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.

We were considering moving to a 3 Peer Group Structure however it as agreed at the last PRC Committee Meeting  to stay with the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most activities had been placed with the exception of just  2 or 3. It was agreed that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 Peer Groups. All functions/activities within the business units should now be reflected on the acttached. 

The actions points from this excercise are:

1	to review and agree the attached mapping 

2    consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in previous PRC meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them 	as indicated on the attachment.

3	invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider questionable or requiring further explanation.

      Please return your comments to David Oxley by Friday May 25.

      To have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final VP/MD PRC Meetings.  Definitions of the peer groups are also attached for your ease of
      reference.

Over the past few months, Enron Global Finance has been evaluating various opportunities where Enron and Smith Graham &amp; Company may be able to work together.  Unfortunately, the process was slowed when our primary contact at Smith Graham, Gabriel Hayes, left the firm earlier this year.  We have since reestablished discussions and the Global Finance Group is preparing a proposal that a portion (about $30 million) of the Enron Cash Balance Plan portfolio be dedicated to an emerging managers portfolio.  One-third of this money ($10 million) would be invested in bonds, which could be placed with Smith Graham, as the fixed-income manager .  (Total Plan assets are about $235 million.)

The proposal will be submitted to the Plan Administrative Committee at its quarterly meeting on May 3rd.  The proposal should be well received as the Committiee has previously requested that  we optimize our existing allocation to minority money managers.  Gerald Smith has been advised that Enron is looking at ways to allocate money to the firm, and that a decision should be reached sometime in May.  We have not communicated the specific details of our intentions as of yet pending the outcome of the May 3rd meeting.

I am available for further discussion at your convenience.

Regards,
Tim DeSpain

FYI - Strong and colorful words  from a powerful man.
 
Given Lockyer's abilities,  position and and ambition, I would advise building bridges and mending fences  while this is still at the taunting stage.  He wants your  attention.  Knowing him, I'd say that a direct and friendly  call from you or Ken today, followed by a meeting would go a long  way.

Gen. Bill  Lockyer this week suggested the chairman of a Houston-based power company  should be locked in a prison cell with an amorous, tattooed inmate named  Spike.       Lockyer, who is investigating  whether energy firms have manipulated prices on the wholesale electricity  market, made the comment in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that  appeared Tuesday.       "I would love to  personally escort [Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth] Lay to an 8-by-10 cell  that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi my name is Spike,  honey,' " Lockyer said.       Enron spokesman  Mark Palmer called the comment "counterproductive rhetoric" that "does not  merit a response."       But other industry  representatives denounced the remark as "outrageous," especially because  neither Lockyer's office nor any investigative panel has filed charges  against Enron or other companies.       "You'd  expect that the state's chief legal counsel would file charges first and  make public statements second," said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power  Trading Forum, an association of energy producers and traders. "We're very  disappointed with his choice of words, which don't exactly fit the profile  of his office."       In an interview Tuesday,  Lockyer said he decided to "ratchet up" the commentary to "put [energy  companies] on notice" that "we are not afraid of them and have the will to  prosecute."       "What I'm trying to do is  let these economic buccaneers understand that if we catch them, they're  going to be prosecuted," Lockyer said. "Just because they're  multimillionaires and run big corporations, it doesn't provide them with  immunity."       The attorney general is  investigating whether power company officials tried to maximize profits  through illegal manipulation of prices on the wholesale energy market.  Several panels, including a state Senate committee and the California  Public Utilities Commission, are conducting similar probes.        On Tuesday, Lockyer announced that three  power companies have agreed to turn over documents subpoenaed months ago  by his investigators. The attorney general went to court to obtain the  documents after the companies failed to meet a March 19 deadline to hand  them over.       Lockyer said the forthcoming  documents would help his office as it sifts through mountains of evidence  in search of possible violations of antitrust or unfair business practice  laws.       "Evidence is accumulating that  certainly infers illegal activity," Lockyer said. "But we need to make  sure it's compelling and clear enough that you can convince a jury."        Lockyer said he singled out Enron's  chairman because the Houston company is the world's largest energy trader.        At least one observer found Lockyer's  comments refreshingly candid. Harry Snyder, a senior advocate of Consumers  Union, said, "Let Lockyer be Lockyer."  * * *      Times staff writer Dan  Morain contributed to this story.

  <content type="text" name="message">On May 10, 2001, a memo was sent out regarding "Peer Group Mapping".  This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.

Please refer to the attached original memo, if you have not responded to David Oxley and have any comments 
please respond to him by May 25, 2001.

Dave Delainey



Following my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group mapping for all business units. This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.

We were considering moving to a 3 Peer Group Structure however it as agreed at the last PRC Committee Meeting  to stay with the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most activities had been placed with the exception of just  2 or 3. It was agreed that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 Peer Groups. All functions/activities within the business units should now be reflected on the acttached. 

The actions points from this excercise are:

1	to review and agree the attached mapping 

2    consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in previous PRC meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them 	as indicated on the attachment.

3	invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider questionable or requiring further explanation.

      Please return your comments to David Oxley by Friday May 25.

      To have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final VP/MD PRC Meetings.  Definitions of the peer groups are also attached for your ease of
      reference.

  <content name="title" action="cluster">Lay It On the Line Survey Results</content>
  <content type="text" name="message">Recently, I asked you to "Lay It On the Line" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward.

First, let's take a look at the survey results.

I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were:

1.	Stock price
2.	The PRC
3.	Employee/internal morale
4.	External reputation and image
5.	"Walking the talk" of integrity and respect
_________________________________________________________________________________________

II.  We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.

_________________________________________________________________________________________

III.  We asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A "meltdown" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact &amp; Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&amp;A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com &lt;http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY &amp; RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.</content>

  <content type="text" name="message">Dear Jeff,

I sent you a presentation concerning InterFit Health which is the diagnostic
screening company we discussed months ago. There are two issues I would like
to address: I. Are you interested in investing? 2. I would like to present
to Enron our scope of services which will in all certainty provide lower
healthcare cost and greater productivity. The cost of our biometric testing
is very modest in comparison to your total health costs and leads to
designing your benefits program with disease risk knowledge vs. shooting in
the dark. This is a truly unique approach which is why JP Morgan Chase,
Reliant, and Halliburton have become clients of the company in the last
month. I know that you are very time constrained so if you cannot address
this with me please refer me to another Enron officer who has bottom line
responsibility for your healthcare costs. The same information was sent to
Ken and I have placed a call to him. I appreciate your considering our
services.

Best regards,

Walt</content>

  <content type="text" name="message">Dear Messer's Skilling and Lay,

I heard a song with the lyrics "how can I say thanks for all the things you've done for me", I'm pretty sure it's by Andre Crouch.  Let me thank you for the help and loving kindness you and ENRON has shown to me during the period after the devasting floods.  I've never worked for such a wonderful company before, the people here in every walk of life are so very friendly.  The scriptures speaks of drawing people toward you with loving kindness, and you certainly have here at ENRON.  The people that i've met here want to be here and that's a good sign.  One morning on the elevator a lady was singing on the way to her floor, i didn't recognize the tune right away, probably because it was early morning, the tune turned out to be "OKLAHOMA" so I joined her, she invited me to come and be a part of the ENRON CHOIR.  Just  the other day you Mr. Skilling passed my desk and asked had my group just moved to the 31st floor, i've only been here at ENRON since January '01 and wasn't aware that my group had moved from the 29th floor.  My Grandmother always used to tell me as a child, "you better keep a thought in mind, that someones watching you, and they want to be just like you, setting their examples by you, and they're never gonna miss a single thing you do.  And I live by that today.  Well I can be a little longwinded,  but remember:

If I can help somebody  as I pass along,
If I can cheer somebody with a word or song,
If I can can show somebody that he's traveling wrong,
Then my living shall not be in vain.

And you both have certainly obeyed that dictum.


God Bless You Both,

California; Metro Desk
Electricity Cost Data Spread the Blame Power: Many suppliers charged more
than the firms that Davis has pilloried, records show.

SACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more diverse
group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray Davis,
who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records
show.


During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretches of
power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and private
entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid
to Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by
the Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California.


Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per
megawatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San Diego Gas
& Electric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power, the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a
megawatt-hour charged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC
Hydro, to $292 an hour by the DWP.


In fact, some of the biggest private power companies singled out for
criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc., Duke Energy and
Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid for the period.
Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 per megawatt-hour,
according to an analysis of the documents.


The figures cover the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased
by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more
than a month of razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power
emergencies.


Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest
barbs at private out-of-state generators because, in general, they have
reaped the highest profits over the longest period.


"You have to look at the whole picture," Maviglio said.


"The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the
generators who wear cowboy hats," he said. "Their profits were 100% to 400%
above last year. . . . Just because there are other entities who are
charging us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact that we are
getting ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte."


The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times
on the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on California's
electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year's first
quarter.


The records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion buying power in
the first five months of the year, and underscore the complexity of the
state's energy problem. They also show that patterns of high prices are not
limited to a few generators.


Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the water resources agency, said that the
reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the
year. "All the prices were high," he said, noting the downward trend in
costs since his agency began buying power in mid-January.


The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purchases went from $316
in January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an average of $321 per
hour to $271, the reports show.


In the first quarter of the year, some public entities' prices far exceeded
those of the biggest private companies. For example, Houston-based Enron,
one of the nation's biggest power traders, charged an average of $181 per
megawatt-hour. And Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold the most to the state,
a total of $706 million, charged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour.


By contrast, a Calgary, Canada, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a
megawatt-hour, and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average
charges of $330 per megawatt-hour.


A spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said recently that the "vilification of
Enron was based on politics, not facts." Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not
be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the
past, the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered
last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on.


A spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric,
said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to
see the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be
reached Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of
producing the power needed by the state were extremely high.


More Power Bought Than Projected


Hidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agency's efforts,
coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas
prices, have begun to tame the state's market.


Still, the state had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May,
about 10% more than Davis' analysts had projected.


Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply
problems in April. He said reports will show that power purchases fell
short of state projections in June and early July.


The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June
and July, partly because spot prices have fallen sharply, often to well
under $100 a megawatt-hour.


A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday credited
Davis' program of nurturing new power generation and establishing long-term
power contracts with with "moving the California electric energy industry
closer to normalcy."

  <content type="text" name="message">Dear Mr. Lay &amp; Mr. Skilling,

I cannot begin to express my gratitude to you and Enron for the $1000.00 I received.  My husband and I were devastated when our home flooded.  I was so proud to be an Enron employee when I heard that we had donated $500,000 to the flood relief fund.  But when I learned that we would be eligible for $1000 as flood victims, I could only burst into tears and thank God for working for such a humanitarian company.  I was a participant in the Fortune 500 survey last year and rated Enron as THE best place to work for! I truly believed it then and even more so now.  Thank you again for going above and beyond this employees' expectations.  We are truly grateful.

Saturday, May 26, 2001 (SF Chronicle)
Enron's secret bid to save deregulation/PRIVATE MEETING: Chairman pitches his plan to prominent Californians
Christian Berthelsen, Scott Winokur, Chronicle Staff Writers


   Energy executive Kenneth Lay, head of powerful Enron Corp., quietly
courted Arnold Schwarzenegger, Richard Riordan, Michael Milken and other
luminaries this week in Beverly Hills to drum up support for his solution
to California's energy crisis.
   His prescription called for more rate increases, an end to state and
federal investigations and less rather than more regulation.
   Lay, a close friend of President Bush and one of his largest campaign
contributors, hosted a private 90-minute meeting in a conference room at
the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills on Thursday.
   Among the participants were Milken, the former head of the Drexel Burnham
Lambert investment banking firm who pleaded guilty to fraud charges in
1990 and who now runs a think tank based in Santa Monica; movie star
Schwarzenegger;
   and Riordan, the mayor of Los Angeles. Schwarzenegger and Riordan have
been courted recently as GOP gubernatorial candidates.
   One participant, who agreed to speak on the condition he not be
identified, said the meeting appeared to be geared toward getting
participants to support Lay's vision and then champion it to officials who
are trying to solve the state's energy mess.
   PLAN TO RESCUE DEREGULATION
   The source said the timing and tone of the meeting suggested Lay is
concerned that California will abandon its disastrous experiment with
power markets by either re-regulating the system or creating a government
authority to provide electricity. Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation last
week to create and fund a state power authority that would build, buy and
run power plants in California.
   "They're trying to rescue deregulation," the source said of Enron
executives. "They think the whole state power authority is a bad idea."
   At the meeting, Enron representatives circulated a four-page position
paper titled "Comprehensive Solution for California," which was obtained
by The Chronicle. It said ratepayers should bear responsibility for the
billions in debt incurred by the state's public utilities and that
investigations of power price manipulation and political rhetoric are
making matters worse.
   The paper made no mention of the possibility that much of the runaway
electricity costs in California is due to market manipulation by power
generators and traders -- a possibility given credibility in studies by
regulators and economists.
   One of the talking points read: "Get deregulation right this time --
California needs a real electricity market, not government takeovers."
Another point suggested giving consumers monetary rebates for conserving
electricity.
   INVOLVED IN EARLY DAYS
   Lay has been an aggressive champion of deregulated electricity markets and
was an early advocate in persuading California to begin its experiment
with a competitive power market system.
   Lay has created a new kind of company in the process, one that essentially
produces nothing but makes money as a middle-man, buying electricity from
generators and selling it to consumers. During the first quarter of this
year, Enron's revenues increased 281 percent to $50.1 billion.
   Asked about the purpose of the meeting, Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for
Enron, said she would "look into that" and then did not return repeated
telephone calls seeking comment. One participant said Denne was present at
the meeting.
   D.C. CONNECTIONS
   Meanwhile, Lay's power in Washington is reported to have reached
unprecedented heights. According to a story in yesterday's New York Times,
Lay supplied the Bush administration with a list of candidates for jobs
regulating the power industry and even interviewed one of them. The story
also said Lay essentially threatened to seek the removal of the chairman
of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Curt Hebert, if he does not
support Lay's desire to further deregulate the nation's electricity
system. Lay denied the allegation.
   Also in attendance at this week's meeting were Bruce Karatz, chief
executive of home builder Kaufman &amp; Broad; Ray Irani, chief executive of
Occidental Petroleum; and Kevin Sharer, chief executive of biotech giant
Amgen.
   Among those who were invited but did not attend were former Los Angeles
Lakers star Earvin "Magic" Johnson; supermarket magnate and Bill Clinton
supporter Ron Burkle; and Dennis Tito, recently returned from the world's
first civilian space trip.
   Milken, through a spokesman, confirmed that he attended the meeting, but
declined to be interviewed. Schwarzenegger could not be reached for
comment through a publicist, and Sharer did not return a call yesterday
afternoon.
   A spokesman for Riordan, Peter Hidalgo, said the Los Angeles mayor
attended,
   but was "not intending to formulate any kind of policy position on this
issue.
   His intent is to listen to all sides."
   Attached to the Enron handout was a two-page open letter, addressed to
Davis and the state Legislature, apparently prepared for those who support
Lay's position and would be willing to sign their names to it. The source
who participated in the meeting said those assembled appeared noncommittal
and asked a number of questions of Lay, but did not agree to champion his
agenda.

  <content type="text" name="message">Rosie...absolutely!!  I'll make my schedule work.  However, unless this is a personal favor Ken is doing for the gentlemen involved, I'd also be happy to "field" this for him.  I told Ken we(University Affairs/Public Affairs) would not impose on his schedule for these kinds of visits until after January.  Clearly, there are occasions where some of Ken's many friends contact him directly, and , as kind as Ken is, even at extreme times, he agrees.   However, if this is not a personal visit, I'm quite certain this dean is looking for a better financial and recruiting relationship with Enron.  In fact, we are putting together a "master Plan"" financial relationship with UT overall (Rick Causey is the exec lead), and realistically, we are not recruiting engineers per se.  So Rosie my darling friend, let me know if you'd like me to politely intervene and take this off your list, or if this  is one of those personal friendship situations, in which case, I'll be there on the 14th!
 
Thanks and kisses!!

  <content type="text" name="message">
Hi  Kenneth,
We are within a year anniversary attempt to arrange a meeting with you and
our CEO  Jack Nester in order to present Telecompression, and how we can cut
"Enron Corp." by hundreds of millions off Long Distance phone bill.
The second part of this email is to show how we are advancing toward this
"Goal" and asking to allow us this meeting or a conference call with you.

Telecompression Technologies  announces  IntraTel,  groundbreaking new 40-1
Telecompression software that dramatically reduces intra-office
long-distance phone bills.
IntraTel, a revolutionary new 40-to-1 voice compression software solution
that could shave millions of dollars off corporate long-distance telephone
bills, has just been announced by Telecompression Technologies, Inc. (TTI)
California.
IntraTel, converts a company's LAN, WAN, intranet or VPN into the most
advanced telephony communications system ever available. "For large
corporations with multiple offices, campuses, including offices abroad,
"this is the communications technology breakthrough everyone's been waiting
for. It's easily the most significant cost-savings telecommunications tool
of the past 50 years."

IntraTel, is unique because of its dynamic bandwidth allocation and an
unparalleled capacity of providing toll quality voice with up to 40-to-1
voice compression. It outpaces standard code compressions that can, at best,
deliver voice at an 8-to-1 compression. This makes possible a level of
compression, which TTI has trademarked as Telecompression, applicable across
corporate enterprise networks regardless of bandwidth.  "we can do all of
this without sacrificing voice quality."

IntraTel, which quickly installs on a Windows 2000 network, allows companies
to immediately realize savings of thousands of dollars every month for calls
to dispersed company facilities and their surrounding area codes.  "For very
large corporations with staffs and facilities all over the world, savings
could easily run into the millions of dollars every year."

IntraTel replaces a company's standard telephone communications with
network-based PCs on any type of digital network. The company installs the
IntraTel Server software on one or more network domain controllers or
dedicated Windows 2000 workstations, and individual users can easily
download the IntraTel Client software from the network. This gives each
intra-company PC user, regardless of his or her global location, access to
the program's unique cost-saving benefits and features.

The program makes possible extremely high-quality PC-to-PC, PC-to-phone and
phone-to-PC connections. It supports 10baseT, 100baseT, and 1000baseT, as
well as optical-based networks. PBX features are included to facilitate user
transition from conventional Telco-type systems to network-based telephony
operations. IntraTel can support up to 65,000 users over a wide area
intranet or VPN comprised of either copper, fiber, satellite, wireless or
combined system.

Other features include phone conferencing for up to eight individuals in
multiple locations, whiteboard chat, optional voice mail lobby, text chat,
file transfer and save-to-file, and more.
Among the many options are IntraTel Phone Jump, which lets any user dial any
phone number in an area code in which the company has both an IntraTel
Access Server and a connected employee/user. In other words, if your San
Francisco office has an employee in London with the IntraTel server and PC
software in place, you could call any other phone number in that London area
code without paying long-distance phone charges.

The new IntraTel Encryption option. This solution gives businesses low-cost
capabilities for protecting their worldwide telecommunications. IntraTel
Encryption provides the highest level of secure voice, text and data
transfer with channel-by-channel encryption. Each company receives and
manages its own custom key store, giving it maximum security for sensitive
communications."

This email is divided to 4 sub emails....

First I would like to apologize for miss presenting my self as the person
who talk to Mr., Lay and Mr. Whalley, I assumed that you knew the connection
between Dirad Inc. ( called as of July 2001  Telecompression Technology Inc.
TTI ), StealthSoft, and e-Business.


On October 2000 Dirad Inc. Willie Williams spoke to Mr. Lay , and Mr.
Whalley, Willie was referred to Bob Justice and Ted Sietz few days later we
had signed an NDA with Enron in order to conduct a meeting between Dirad
technical scientists. Mr. Cecil Motley and  Mr. Ted Sietz VP Enron
Broadband.
Two months later we had a meeting with Ted Sietz, Rob Justice, and a few
other gentleman from Enron at our offices in California. At that time our
patent technology was early on in the development stage.
( If you like I can fax you this NDA )

As a prodigy development organization Dirad  change their name to
Telecompresion Technology Inc. to refract the new "Netch" we created in the
telecommunication industry.
Since the market is extremely "Hot", and we are experiencing 420K potential
" Sits"  currently testing our Beta technology. We fill it is the time to
take action.
TTI  has a valid business propositions and we can present it to Enron Corp.
at your convenience . Our CEO would like to meet Mr. Ken Lay to introduce
the hole concept to Enron Corp. and alleviating your trading partner MCI,
and maybe Qwest Commu. if they aren't out of the picture already.

Around mid July 2001, I spoke to Rick Causey about our mature developed
technology, and send and email to him introducing TTI. When I called back
his assistant Sharon Westford, referred me to George Wasaff who referred me
to Peter Goebel,
I sent an email to Peter Goebel at the end of August ,and showed him the
info on Telecompression web site. Peter asked Hasan Imam to call me.

All of us Robert Conley, Morgan Law from StealthSoft , Willie Williams and
E-Business are working together promoting Telecompression Technology.

Enclosed is the 2  correspondences:
1. Between me and your associates.
2. The correspondence between my associate Morgan Laws, and Robert Conley
   the former Chairman of Lockheed Corporation and you.

Subject: reference correspondence with Mr. Kenneth Lay re 50% savings on
Enron phone billing



Dear Mr. Knight:

The following message was sent to Mr. Lay last week.

Please review the contents.  I will ask StealthSoft associate
Arik Amir to contact you via E-mail with more specific
details. Demonstration testing is now underway with companies
similar to Enron who wish to trim their phone bill down 50%.
It costs nothing for the test which proves the above.  Thank
you for your assistance with Arik Amir.

"Dear Mr. Lay:

There is a way to save Enron approximately $1 billion during
the next 18 months.

A simple demonstration at zero cost to Enron is available.
If you like what Enron saves during the 2 week test, you
will greatly appreciate the annual savings.

Our Chairman Robert F. Conley, Esq. is the former Chairman
of Lockheed Corporation International.  Mr. Conley established
the Lockheed Overseas Network in 120 nations.  Prior to Lockheed
he established the General Dynamics Overseas Network worldwide.
Mr.. Conley is most impressed with the technology mentioned above
and the savings in telecommunications for major corporations.

If the saving of this kind of money is appealing to you, please
E-mail or contact me for a 2 week test,, and/or additional
information.

Thank you for reviewing this offer.

Sincerely,

Morgan Laws
Director of Foreign Operations
StealthSoft Corporation

  <content type="text" name="message">Dear Family,

Just for everyone's information, there is no special dress code.  Dinner
will remain casual to casual/chic, as usual.  We have scheduled Allen Ross
to be there early in the evening to help us take a few very special group
photographs.  Because of this we are providing VERY SIMPLE NON-SCAREY
Halloween costumes for the wee ones to put on over their casual attire for
photos.

I don't want to make this a difficult or painful process and the costumes
will hopefully make it fun.  The most important photograph I am hoping to
get is with "Pop-Pop and his six great grandchildren."  If that goes well,
Pop-Pop will step out and Mamia and Papi will step in quickly to be
photographed with all of their precious grandchildren.  Then depending on
whether the wee ones can handle it and don't have melt down, we would also
love for the five children and spouses to quickly join in for a larger group
shot.  If it works, it works...and it doesn't, it doesn't.  NO BIG DEAL!
We'll just see how it goes.

If all goes well, once we have finished with our special photo session, any
of you who may want individual photographs taken are on your own to do so as
you wish.

I hope this answers all of the questions Barb's early e-mail might have
sparked.  If not, call me.

Love, Mamia

  <content type="text" name="message">Ken,

I wanted to update you on the reaction to your most recent letter to the Indian Prime Minister. You recall that we recommended you write again to the Prime Minister and express disappointment at the lack of progress since your July trip and your August letter containing our offer to sell our equity at costs. I believe writing this letter was the proper response but only time will tell what reaction (if any) finally comes from the Indian government.

I think you should know about the press coverage of the letter, just in case the letter were to come up in any conversation you might have with someone from the US government. I am not anticipating this at all, but I would not want you to be unprepared about the press coverage. The US embassy over here is very much up to speed.  I met again with Ambassador Blackwill on Tuesday of this week and gave him a general update on the current status. His view is that it is very difficult in the post-Sept. 11 environment to get anyone in Delhi or Washington to pay attention to economic matters such as Dabhol, but he is trying as best he can. He is meeting with Brajesh Mishra (Prime Minister's principal secretary) on Saturday, who will have just returned from Washington meetings with Ms. Rice, among others, principally to discuss anti-terrorist matters. John Hardy of our DC office briefed the State Department last week in advance of these meetings, and we are awaiting to hear any discussion or outcome regarding Dabhol.

Regarding press coverage of the letter, as we anticipated, the entire letter was leaked to the press. Several articles have appeared that describe the "harshly worded" letter and many articles have quoted verbatim sections from the letter. The Wall Street Journal article from last week presented the letter fairly, and I think it came out rather sympathetic to our position. The Indian papers have been neutral to negative. For example, an editorial (reprinted below) was in Wednesday's Financial Express, a business daily in India (but not as widely circulated or respected as The Economic Times or The Business Standard). Note the editorial below says your letter states "that any government found to have expropriated the property of US firms automatically faces sanctions from that country." Your letter did not state that, but this is a holdover from the earlier Financial Times interview.

Many people I have met with in the Indian government have made references to the letter, saying they do not think it was appropriate. I respond by saying that given our 9 year history of nothing but frustrations, and the lack of progress over the past 2 months, we do think it is appropriate and it reflects our current views regarding our experience in India. Generally, when they mention it time and again, it probably means the letter is having at least some of its intended effect. 

I'll keep you, Stan and Jim updated as we hear more from the Indian government.

Wade

THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, Wednesday, September 26, 2001


Lay off, Mr Lay (Editorial)
Enron tries terror tactics

Enron Corporation's CEO Kenneth Lay has reportedly written a letter to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee warning him of adverse consequences to the Indian economy if the Dabhol Power Company imbroglio is not resolved quickly. He says that if Enron receives anything less than its full investment in DPC, it would amount to an act of expropriation. He further points out that any government found to have expropriated the property of US firms automatically faces sanctions from that country. Reportedly, the letter was written three days after the attack on the World Trade Centre. So Mr Lay probably ought to be forgiven for reading more than he should into the "dead or alive" rhetoric of his pal, George W Bush, whose election campaign Mr Lay generously funded. Saner counsel has since prevailed even at the White House; and far from imposing fresh sanctions, the US government is busy buying support even from countries such as Pakistan by lifting sanctions and offering a hefty aid package. Enron has never hesitated to use the considerable economic and political clout of the US government in pushing the Dabhol project at various times. Post September 11, the US government - which is in fact 'rewarding' Pakistan despite its clearly identified role in funding terrorist groups - ought not to be terrorising India on Enron. Hence, it is entirely appropriate for the Prime Minister to borrow that little Americanism, recently made popular by Pervez Musharraf, and ask Kenneth Lay to lay off!

Interestingly, Mr Lay's letter apparently makes no mention of several important facts that will dictate how much India may have to pay Enron. These include the findings of the Madhav Godbole committee report which expose substantial overcharging by DPC on several counts and reveals excess capacity created for port handling and regassification. Moreover, DPC's inability to ramp up the power plant to full contracted capacity within the specified time period has enormous penal provisions attached to it. This serious technical deficiency apart - which alone is grounds enough for repudiating the DPC contract - the government also has a good case to charge the US company with fraud and misrepresentation. The Maharashtra government 's judicial inquiry only makes India's case stronger. Let us not allow ourselves to be pushed around by Enron's threats and political connections.

Dear Mr. Lay,
I would like to take this opportunity to say that I am very sorry to see the developments relating to the proud company that you built, and to say thank you for the time I spent under your leadership.  I was with Enron for two and a half years, and I enjoyed that period as much as any time in my career.
>From my first exposure to you, the new employee orientation, I was very impressed by your willingness to address the group, and as you walked by on your way out, you smiled and nodded at me.  I was confident that I had made the right decision to join Enron. I also respect your sincere interest in the community, and the efforts that were undertaken to help those less fortunate. I believe that you handled the California energy issue with exactly the right amount of finesse and determination on behalf of Enron. Your willingness to forego the significant payments available to you under your contract is another example of the type of person that you are. I think that what might have impressed me the most, however, is the Christmas gathering on the 50th floor two years ago when you took time out of your valuable day to greet and take pictures with a long line of the rank and file employees, including contract security personnel.  The list goes on and on, requiring mu! ch more time and space than is available here.
You have earned my respect, and I wish you the absolute best in the future.  If there is ever anything that I can do to help in any way, please do not hesitate to contact me.  I have significant experience in customer/supplier relationships, contracts, and I am a very effective negotiator.
Again, thank you for all that you have done for me, the energy industry, and the city of Houston. 
Sincerely,
Tom Moore  ]]></content>

Subject:	RE: Daily Update

On Behalf of Jeff Shields

So when is Ken Lay going to tell us something with substance in these reports. This morning I listened as four different co-workers came in and logged on and snickered or made other negative remarks in response to today's email on behalf of Ken Lay. One person said she wished we would stop getting these emails because they are "empty." All we are getting are generalities and hollow comments about yesterdays news. Lets hear some positive statements from Ken Lay making clear that the financial actions of Enron are clean. I would appreciate being told exactly what it is that the SEC is looking  for. Many in the Portland office are asking just who are these Board members and what is it that drives our Senior Management? We know their names, we don't understand their values. I want to see leadership. Where is Ken and the Board? Mayor Guiliani got out in the public after the World Trade Center disaster and reassured the public. He became a leader. He didn't sit in his office and have a ghost writer send empty emails to city employees. 

I watched as Rite Aid went through something similar to what Enron is going through. Enron would be well served to study the Rite Aid situation and learn from their experience. Rite Aid stumbled along for 6 months while the Board and CEO defended their actions and were not able to face reality until the company stock fell from $50 to $3. You need to make dramatic changes in the management structure or else management needs to step out and publicly restore confidence. It does NO GOOD for the Board and Ken to stand behind management and business groups only to turn around and put individuals "on leave" or close those business groups you stood behind a day earlier. 

I noticed how little confidence the top executives at Enron had in this company when they sold off hundreds of millions of dollars in stock between November and February. Many of us see that as the beginning of the moral bankruptcy at the top of Enron. We put our retirement in your hands and you pilfered it. I had so much faith in Enron's management that I have taken my annual bonus in stock options. To me that is a duty to demonstrate my commitment to Enron. Rumors are circulating in the Portland office that the Board is not likely to fund a bonus pool this year. Now that is inspiration! Is that true? 

You MUST instill confidence in your employees TODAY. You claim that Enron employees are your most valuable assets. You had better treat them as such. Email such as this one DO NOT INSPIRE confidence. This is not Enron's proudest moment. I enjoy working for the company. I take pride in my work and do my job honestly and open. The deals I bring in to this company are done in the spirit of mutual benefits with our counter parties. I was disappointed to get a copy of a PR piece in my home mail yesterday with interviews and profiles of "Three Men."  Reading their values and accomplishments led me to believe these guys are motivated not by family and ethics but rather by material possession. This is the intellect of failure. If your driven simply to own a boat and your measure of success was recognized when you bought a big house, there is a very high probability that you will breech the line of ethical (and perhaps legal) financial actions in order to have more. 

Please send us a statement from Ken Lay and the Board telling us about the Cultural Values they are going to strive to instill in the company. I think a huge statement would be made by having the Board of Directors and Ken Lay personally reinvest the hundreds of millions of dollars that you have taken out of this company back in Enron stock TODAY. 

Ken Lay should come to Portland and give us reassurance that the earnings from this business unit mean something. Ken needs to be a leader. Please, no more ghost emails.

Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.</content>

Oh Mr. Lay, I am woefully sorry. I know you will be talking to the employees soon and I will be praying for you. 
I was just praying and asking God what I could say to you. I don't want to be presumptuous. This is the verse that came to mind. Psalm 34:19 "Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all."  
You may not feel righteous right now but you are. When you gave Jesus your life, you became righteous. So you will be delivered-it may not look like it now but this is not the end of the story. He has a plan. I know that you can't see HOW this could work together for good for you but it will. Great is His faithfulness! All afflictions-it says. ALL!

   Subject:  Precious man of God. 
   Mr. Lay, 
   I am a former employee of Enron and have been through many trials in 
the 
   past few years. God has been faithful and seen me through them all. 
Dear 
   sir, I can tell you that I can count it all joy. I just want to 
   encourage you. These look like very dark times right now. Call upon 
the 
   name of the Lord. Throw yourself on the mercy and grace of the Lord 
and 
   remember all that he has done. He is a BIG, GOOD God that LOVES you! 
His 
   arm hasn't been shortened that He cannot help you. 
   You will be glad to know that the true testimony of you as a man is 
of a 
   good report. You will glorify God in this. I am listening to a song 
   right this minute that I so wish you could hear. It would bring you 
such 
   comfort. It is based on the verse that talks about "all of my help 
   cometh from the Lord". How true that is for you. 
     Lord Jesus, you are a good God that sees all things. Mr. Lay is a 
man 
     of God. That means he is your child. You tell us that you are an 
ever 
     present help in time of trouble. These troubles are over his head 
but 
     under your feet. Lord Jesus, show yourself strong on his behalf. 
     Glorify yourself and Mr. Lay will give you the glory. He knows, 
Lord. 
     Help him in this time when the waters are flowing over his head. 
Hear 
     him from where you are. We are all but dust. Who are we that you 
are 
     mindful of us but you tell us in your Word that You have good 
thoughts 
     and plans for us and they are for good and NOT EVIL that we may 
have 
     an expected end. (Jer 29:11-For I know the thoughts that I think 
     toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to 
     give you an expected end.) Who can stand except you give us grace? 
     Lord, you are so good. Remind Mr. Lay of who you really are. In the 
     mighty name of Jesus! 
   Mr. Lay, get some scripture to hang onto-write it down on a card and 
   carry it with you. When things come against you (the enemy), you will 
   need to remember who you are in Jesus! The greatest battle on earth 
was 
   fought with the Word of God (Satan against Jesus in the wilderness)! 
   Isaiah 54:17-No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and 
   every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt 
   condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their 
   righteousness is of me, saith the LORD. 
   Oh Mr. Lay, one more thing. I am telling you that I haven't a clue as 
to 
   what has or has not been done. I just want to show you something from 
   the Word of God how God is. If you will read Isaiah's calling in 
Isaiah 
   6 and read Moses' calling in Exodus 3, you will see that God DOES NOT 
   mention their sin to them. Isaiah was just overcome with the glory of 
   God and confessed all by himself and Moses (remember he had killed an 
   Egyptian) was just trying to convince God that He had to be wrong. 
The 
   ONLY reason I mention it is because sometimes we delay in going to 
God 
   because we think we have done something wrong. God tells us that He 
   hasn't dealt with us according to our sins. KNOW that NO MATTER WHAT, 
   Jesus is ready to fight on your behalf! It is ALWAYS about God's 
SPIRIT 
   and not our strength. 
   When I started this email, you were just a stranger. You are now my 
   beloved brother in Christ. Isn't it amazing how God works. He has 
knit 
   my heart to yours. I will be on my knees for you. Phillipians tells 
us 
   to pray for E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G! What does everything mean? 
EVERYTHING! 
   God's gonna do some amazing stuff so get ready!!!! His ways aren't 
our 
   ways and remember too-He is able to do EXCEEDINGLY ABOVE what we can 
ask 
   or think! 
   Lynda Phinney 
   The Joy of the Lord is my strength...

   Dear Lane -

   Ken Lay said to advise you that he can speak to the session August 5 -

   Mr.  Lay,

   Hello.  Tori left a message requesting me to  send my invitation to you
   again...we really feel is it vital that now, more than  ever, our top
   military leaders need to hear from the private sector's top  leaders

   on their success.  I truly hope you will consider speaking  to this
   prestigious group of gentlemen who are the decision makers in  our proud
   military.  I look forward to hearing from  you.

  <content type="text" name="message">Hi Morgan,

Now that I do not work for Ken Lay and, as a stockholder, he actually
works for me, I can go directly too him and tell him what I really
think.  I can also tell all of the board members what I think as well,
without fear of getting fired by one of my former politically motivated
bosses.  Ken Lay earned a PHD as an economist.  He knows exactly what I
am talking about.  What he is doing is trying correct many bad Enron
decisions and to find "easy" income in a tough time.  He is very good at
"working the floor", as I call it, of the New York Stock Exchange.  He
has probably made deals with brokers and large mutual fund managers such
as Vanguard and Fidelity for them to repurchase large amounts of Enron
stock IF he can clean up Enron and bring in some revenue.  So far, so
good.  The problem arises when you look at the quality of the revenue
Ken is generating.  What I see is largely from "one time" sales of
existing assets and not from continuing operations.  In other words, the
effect is only temporary and it is much harder to re-create at a later
time because the "asset" is gone.

Personally, I am not buying into the "trust me" line from Enron.  It is
time for Enron's leadership to earn their millions in salary.

Love,
Dad

Ken,

Thank you for your response to my email.  Whether you actually took the
time to respond or left it to one of your assistants, I hope you read my
comments/suggestions and truly understood them.

I have a few more comments and suggestions!

You are correct, overall stock values have declined and Enron has some
additional, unique issues related to its broadband and tele-com
business, payments from California and large investments in foreign
power plants, particularly India.  However, I cannot agree with your
comments (or Jeff's) about short sellers.

Short sellers, like jackals and vultures, exist for a reason and are an
important part of the whole financial community in which we live.  Short
sellers (and Jackals) are always looking for a deal(meal).  When they
find an unhealthy company (animal), they investigate, which oftens leads
to greater opportunities.  Enron, under Jeff's leadership, was not
healthy and the short sellers (jackals) found a wonderful opportunity.

Your current job, as was Jeff Skilling's, is to not provide the short
sellers (jackals) a reason or opportunity to focus on Enron's stock
price.

I applaud your recent commitment to the financial community to provde
better definition regarding Enron's profits.  Developing the necessary
internal mechanism for a largely transparent financial reporting system
will police itself and will ultimately reinforce confidence in Enron's
true value.

As an economist, you need to remember that the market value of any
company, in today's economy, is largely based on the market's perception
of its value. As you and I have so recently seen, the market very often
reacts on preception and only looks at intrinsic value as an
afterthought.  The financial community believes that if it quacks like a
duck and walks like a duck, then....just maybe it is a duck and not
really a racehorse

Enron executives need to be more cognizant of the negative impact their
excessive insider selling of shares has on market preception.  Using
stock options in lieu of salary is a very powerful incentive but it can
also backfire, especially if the proper safe guards are not in place.
Excessive insider trades can and should be limited.

Doing good things for the right reasons works! For some years now,
Northern's leadership has not done many good things for the right
reasons.  They are highly political and have developed a nasty habit of
not telling their upper management (Stan Horton) the truth, but what
Stan wants to hear.  They are doing many things, not because they
should, but becaue they can get away with them.  This activity works
only as long as their customers do not have a choice!  You want
examples-look at the non-Enron pipeline activity in Florida and the
upper midwest.

A solid domestic asset with a reasonable return is much better than the
possibility of much higher returns on assets in unstable, foreign
markets.  Enron is not smarter than the world and the world has
certainly demonstrated that it will not allow Enron to possess very much
control over world affairs.  Let's learn from our mistakes!

Selling difficult assets, such as in India, is good.  Selling profitable
assets, such as Portland General is bad just to make the bollom line
revenue. Warren Buffet, an Omaha native, does not look like such an old
fuddy-duddy as he once did, as recently as last year.  Strong, solid
fandamentals do count and ......

Short sellers will always be around and DOING GOOD THINGS FOR THE RIGHT
REASONS truly works!!!

Sincerely,

Neal Shaw

Neal:

I appreciate your recent e-mail concerning the decline in Enron's stock
price.  I share with you a very deep disappointment and frustration
about
this decline.

The decline has occurred for a number of reasons.  First, overall stock
values have declined significantly this year.  Enron's stock price has
declined more than averages primarily because of the total melt down in
the
broadband and tele-com business, difficulties with getting paid by the
California utilities and trouble with our large power plant and LNG
project
in India.  These problems have been further compounded by endless
misinformation and rumors, probably promulgated by short sellers.

In any event, I believe we our making progress in addressing these
various
problems.  I believe our stock price will increase over the short to
intermediate term.  With good success, we will be able to restore most
or
all of the value we lost this year over the not too distant future.

I appreciate your concerns and your suggestions and I will certainly do
everything I can to restore your confidence in Enron.

Sincerely,

Ken

   Ken,

   My name is Neal Shaw and I worked for Northern Natural Gas Company in
   Midland, Minneapolis and Omaha in the Marketing Department of Enron's
   Gas Pipeline Group for almost 19 years.  I left the company is
December
   2000. I have a major portion of my investment portfolio in Enron
shares.

   I just read an interesting article titled Sizing up CEO aplomb under
   duress a major concern. by Jamie Lareau.  This article focused on how
to
   recognize CEO's and CEO candidates who were not up to the
requirements
   of their job and used Jeff Skilling as an example.  I have agreed
with
   views of this journalist for some time, especially since Jeff called
a
   fund manager an "asshole".  Publically calling someone is simply Not
   something any CEO should do and you and Enron's board should have
done
   something about Jeff then.

   My point is as follows:  Where were you and the Enron Board during
all
   this?  Why have you let people like Jeff Skilling and Stan Horton
   virtually destroy all growth prospects for the pipelines and totally
   concentrate on trying to make money without an asset base?  A lot of
   people believed Jeff's hype and many people have suffered!  Has Jeff
   suffered?.  I think not especially since he has left Enron with
millions
   of our dollars in his pocket.  Hopefully he will be able to afford
the
   time off to "find himself".

   Did you see the movie "Top Gun"?  Toward the end of the movie, Tom
   Cruise, otherwise know as Maverick, blamed himself for the loss of
his
   friend and simply disengaged from combat flying.  However, when
things
   got really rough, Maverick re-engaged the enemy and did what he was
   hired to do.

   Do you know where this is going?

   You are once again Enron's "Top Gun"!  The enemy is Enron's depressed
   stock price.  It is time for you to re-engage and live up to your
title
   of "Top Gun" and CEO!  I and the rest of Enron's stock holders need
you
   to repair the damage Jeff did and STOP the damage people like Stan
   Horton are currently doing and get Enron back in the mix.

   I sincerely hope you are still capable of doing a good job.  If you
are
   not, refund your salary since Jeff took over and step down.

   Sincerely,

   Neal Shaw

   Ken,
   Ben Streetman, Dean of the UT School of Engineering, tells me that he
   will be in Houston on November 14 and would like to meet with you. I
   realize that your schedule is overflowing these days; however, should
   time permit, the Dean would sincerely appreciate an opportunity to visit
   with you for a few minutes.
   Thank you.

Ken,
Sorrry by my late answer. I am working for Enron since March of this year. I am knwing the Company and I thing that is a very good Company. Now, we are living a very difficult moment around the world and here, we have passing the worst crisis that I have known, but I thrust that next year will be better and we will be able to grow up in South America.
 
 Well, about the 5 questions that you asked, I think:

The Stock are in lowest price. My expectation is that they will increase their value. 
The PRC is very important if every people act with sincerity and if the high level of the Company use that information with criteria to acomodate the employees on the correct position according their skills. 
My moral is optimistic and I transmit the same at the other 17 employee of the Plant. I am committed with Enron and I will work with the objective to improve the performance of the business. 
Localy the image of the Company is very well. Furthermore, we permanent recomending at our employees on this matter. I am sure that the image of the Company is according the image that their employees shows inside and outside the Plant. 
Enron is a Company that have all support that any person can needs. I have had experience when I have needed anything and I have received the support and the respect of people from many places. Enron have a lot of people that are very skills in many issues and they are available to assist in any time.

Many thanks to allow to express my thought.

Best Regards,

Roberto Volont?

Asunto: Lay It On the Line Survey Results



Recently, I asked you to "Lay It On the Line" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward.

First, let's take a look at the survey results.

In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation.

I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were:

1.      Stock price

2.      The PRC

3.      Employee/internal morale

4.      External reputation and image

5.      "Walking the talk" of integrity and respect

_________________________________________________________________________________________

II.  We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.


        % of employees responding

        strongly agree/agree:

I am committed to staying at Enron.     64.1%

Enron is a company I would invest my money in.  60.1%

I am treated with respect.      60.0%

I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family.      59.1%

I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing.    54.7%

Enron truly encourages people to take risks.    47.5%

My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.  46.6%

Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.     41.6%

_________________________________________________________________________________________

III.  We asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.


        More    Same    Less    N/A    
Concerned for communities       34.5%   44.9%   10.3%   10.3%  
Innovative      30.8%   35.7%   24.6%   8.9%

1.      People (the high quality of people at Enron was the most widely-cited aspect):

-X--     talented

---     creative

---     learn from one another

2.      Culture and reputation:

---   willingness to be aggressive and take risks

-X--   ability to embrace change

---   involvement in community

3.      Work environment:

---   true meritocracy

-X--   unlimited opportunities

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:

---     A decline in the overall market and economy;

---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;

---   A "meltdown" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;

---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and

---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---     Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.

---     We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.

We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:

---     Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.

--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:

---     Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.

---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.

---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.

---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.

---     We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.

Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.

---     We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact &amp; Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.

---     Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:

---     We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&amp;A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com &lt;&lt;http://home.enron.com>>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.

--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY &amp; RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.

---     Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.

---     We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.

---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.</content>

I don't want to show this one to Ken.  This guy sounds really angry, though, and wants Ken to write him back.

Dear Mr. Lay ---

As a recently terminated employee of Enron, I have watched the stock's
dramatic tumble in the last weeks mount on top of the horrible performance
over the last months.  As Chairman and CEO, you are ultimately responsible
for everything that goes on in the company.  Without getting into the
potentially criminal and certainly ill-conceived activities of you and other
Enron executives, past and present, I think you have done little but pay lip
service in order to correct things.

Mr. Lay, you and the other executives receive very large salaries.  None of
you is hurting for money.  I think it unconscionable that you and other
executives continue to draw a paycheck.  While employees and others like me
have seen our net worth go from respectable sums to zero, you remain wealthy
beyond most of our dreams.  What's worse, you take more from the company
every week in the form of pay.  I realize you haven't had a soul in quite
sometime.  But are you so unconcerned with the well-being of the people like
me who believed in you and worked years and years for you, that you feel
justified adding insult to injury?  You have literally ruined the lives of
thousands of people.  Your employees deserve better than this!  I was
terminated at mid-year because my book was losing $2 million.  That's right,
$2 million!  That's after I'd made tens of millions for you over the past
eight years.  You and yours have lost me more than that of my own personal
money now.  I don't quite know how to fire you.

It's obvious that neither you nor any other executive currently in power at
Enron have any credibility whatsoever.  Cutting off difficult questions on a
conference call or ignoring pointed questions from employees don't go along
way in restoring any credibility or respect.  There is none left, and yet
you continue to take money out of the Enron coffers for yourself in the form
of compensation.  The hubris there is so incredible to me that it defies
comprehension.

Why, exactly, is Enron paying you?  Do you feel justified being paid by
Enron?  Do you feel justified seeing Enron pay large sums of money to others
involved while those of us with our retirement and childrens' education
funds tied up in Enron suffer more?

I worked at Enron from May of 1993 until this month.  I watched my net worth
increase substantially with my hard work at Enron.  Now, in the blink of an
eye, my net worth has plummeted to levels I haven't experienced since long
before I went to work at Enron.  I worked there for nearly nine years and
now have nothing to show for it.  Well, that's not entirely true.  I have
learned a valuable lesson.  I will never put my faith in someone again like
I did in you.  I now know that you couldn't care less about the well-being
of your employees.  You do still, however, show an incredible capacity for
greed.  You continue to rob the company of funds that could be going to more
useful places.

As I said, I was terminated because my book had $2 million in losses YTD
based on a couple of bad trades and some bad positions I inherited.  In this
pay-for-performance world, where does that leave you?  You continue to
enrich yourself while losing billions of dollars every single day.  I
imagine the PRC would have looked poorly on me if I lost 10-30% of the
company's value each day the market was open.

I no longer work for Enron, but I am left holding the bag with a ton of
worthless options and shares in my 401(k).  I only have a short time in
which to exercise those options.  I don't have the luxury of waiting for
enough good news to come out of the company to make them valuable.  I'm just
one of the thousands upon thousands of financial lives you've ruined.  The
very people that have made you rich you have made poor.  And somehow, you
seem to smile as you keep doing it!

I'd like your response as to why you feel it necessary for you and notable
others to continue to take money from the rest of us in the form of a
paycheck.  Please write me back.

Sincerely,


Scott Hendrickson

Mr. Lay, 
I am a former employee of Enron and have been through many trials in the past few years. God has been faithful and seen me through them all. Dear sir, I can tell you that I can count it all joy. I just want to encourage you. These look like very dark times right now. Call upon the name of the Lord. Throw yourself on the mercy and grace of the Lord and remember all that he has done. He is a BIG, GOOD God that LOVES you! His arm hasn't been shortened that He cannot help you. 
You will be glad to know that the true testimony of you as a man is of a good report. You will glorify God in this. I am listening to a song right this minute that I so wish you could hear. It would bring you such comfort. It is based on the verse that talks about "all of my help cometh from the Lord". How true that is for you. 
Lord Jesus, you are a good God that sees all things. Mr. Lay is a man of God. That means he is your child. You tell us that you are an ever present help in time of trouble. These troubles are over his head but under your feet. Lord Jesus, show yourself strong on his behalf. Glorify yourself and Mr. Lay will give you the glory. He knows, Lord. Help him in this time when the waters are flowing over his head. Hear him from where you are. We are all but dust. Who are we that you are mindful of us but you tell us in your Word that You have good thoughts and plans for us and they are for good and NOT EVIL that we may have an expected end. (Jer 29:11-For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.) Who can stand except you give us grace? Lord, you are so good. Remind Mr. Lay of who you really are. In the mighty name of Jesus!

Mr. Lay, get some scripture to hang onto-write it down on a card and carry it with you. When things come against you (the enemy), you will need to remember who you are in Jesus! The greatest battle on earth was fought with the Word of God (Satan against Jesus in the wilderness)!
Isaiah 54:17-No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is of me, saith the LORD.
Oh Mr. Lay, one more thing. I am telling you that I haven't a clue as to what has or has not been done. I just want to show you something from the Word of God how God is. If you will read Isaiah's calling in Isaiah 6 and read Moses' calling in Exodus 3, you will see that God DOES NOT mention their sin to them. Isaiah was just overcome with the glory of God and confessed all by himself and Moses (remember he had killed an Egyptian) was just trying to convince God that He had to be wrong. The ONLY reason I mention it is because sometimes we delay in going to God because we think we have done something wrong. God tells us that He hasn't dealt with us according to our sins. KNOW that NO MATTER WHAT, Jesus is ready to fight on your behalf! It is ALWAYS about God's SPIRIT and not our strength. 
When I started this email, you were just a stranger. You are now my beloved brother in Christ. Isn't it amazing how God works. He has knit my heart to yours. I will be on my knees for you. Phillipians tells us to pray for E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G! What does everything mean? EVERYTHING! God's gonna do some amazing stuff so get ready!!!! His ways aren't our ways and remember too-He is able to do EXCEEDINGLY ABOVE what we can ask or think!
Lynda Phinney 
The Joy of the Lord is my strength...

  <content type="text" name="message">Dr. Lay,

There is something you can do in light of the recent events. Since I went out on Workmans' Compensation, Enron's policy has been to cover the balance of my salary over the compensation  payment. This money has been critical in keeping our lives and home together. With three more surgeries and a minimum 7-8 months (best case) before I will be rehabilitated and able to return to work, under whatever circumstance, the continuance of my current agreement is critically important to us. 
My concern is that if, or when, EES ceases to exist, before, or after, the Dynergy transaction, that my status may alter in a way that has devastating consequences in an already stress filled situation. My wife is desperate for some assurance, that we will be able to maintain our household until I can fully function @ work again. Is there some way you can help us in this matter? There seems to be quite a bit of confusion regarding what will happen to us.
Thank you.

Joe

Joe -

I was really sorry to hear about your accident.  But delighted we could provide a plane to get you and your wife back to New Jersey.

Hope your recover quickly and if there is any way we can help, let me know.

Dear Dr. Lay,

On  Friday, September 8, 2000, I was on a business trip in Findlay, Ohio meeting with Marathon Ashland Petroleum Company Inc. We had recently signed a  five year  electric deal in Houston covering their  Illinois pipeline and terminal facilities behind four utlities. I was there at their request to review other opportunities in Illinois and Ohio and present them with small gifts over a celebration dinner with their spouses. On Saturday, September 9, 2000 at approximately 5:30 am I was struck in my car by an eighteen wheeler passing traffic in a no passing zone.
Your kindness in providing my wife and I with your personal jet so that I could transfer from the Toledo trauma facility I was in, to a local hospital in our home state of New Jersey was greatly appreciated. I needed to be with my daughters and family and be fully evaluated for the multiple traumas I suffered. Getting home meant everything to us at the time, and there were no good alternatives before your generous gesture.
Since last year I have had three surgeries and am preparing for cervical spine surgery October 23, 2001, followed by knee surgery and ankle surgery. It has been an immensely stressful time for all of us, but we always come back to your help at our time of need. In addition, Dr. Lay, I cannot say enough about the kindness and care of Mark Harada, my supervisor and friend, who was at my side after the accident and who has been an endless source of support through our difficult times.
Mark Harada has been recognized by Enron for the exceptional individual he is. His potential value to Enron is immeasurable. He is truly the embodiment of what an Enron manager should be. I was saddened to hear his leadership role in EES had been diminished. He is exceptional.
Based on the  surgeries that lay ahead of me, with the accompanying rehabilitation periods, it appears that I will not be returning to EES for several months. That is why I'm writing to you now. This was a long overdue note of thanks.
Lastly, in a conversation with John Boosey, (formerly Enserch), before his death, he asked if I spoke with you, to pass on his regards. John was a mentor to me during my years with Enserch/Ebasco and had been in ill health for some time.
Finally, from my wife, Dr. Gail Holian Pestana and I, thank you again for bringing us home.

Our Best Regards,

Joe and Gail

  <content type="text" name="message">My Mom will be bringing our cousin Elizabeth Bourne to Houston August 5 to
attend Theatre Under the Stars Humphrey School of Musical Theatre with Carl
Benjamin for the week and she would like to see all of you.... I am
wondering what everyone's availability is for an early Sunday evening dinner
August 5 or alternatively, any evening Monday - Wednesday that week.  We
will gladly host a barbecue at our newly remodeled hacienda or if you don't
want/don't have time to make the journey to the 'burbs, we could pick a
restaurant.  Please reply and let me know.

Barbara:  Jeff, Carl and I are looking forward to attending the dinner
Tuesday evening.

Everyone, have a terrific weekend!

Hello Everyone,
Just a friendly reminder that the Family dinner is
planned for the 12th at the Grotto restaurant in their
private room at 5:30.  Good food and good fun!
Please RSVP by Friday.  David and Courtney I know that
you are not coming but I wanted to include you in the
reminder incase your plans changed.

For those recieving osmars food.  To make thing run
smoothly in his department it is very important that
you return the circle menu by the friday before the
menu starts.  Osmars mondays have been very rushed
while he waits to find out who is eating.  If you know
you are going to be out of town then please email me
or indicate this on the menu and return it to Osmar.

I have completed the holiday house schedule for 2002
and Sally is madly typing as we speak.  I would expect
to see it early next week.

Please note that I will be in Aspen all next week, and
in Canada until the 21st.  If you need to reach me do
not hesitate to call my mobile or email me.

Take Care, Barb

Subject:	Lay It On the Line Survey Results

Recently, I asked you to "Lay It On the Line" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward.

First, let's take a look at the survey results.

In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation.

I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were:

1.	Stock price
2.	The PRC
3.	Employee/internal morale
4.	External reputation and image
5.	"Walking the talk" of integrity and respect
_________________________________________________________________________________________

II.  We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.


	% of employees responding
	strongly agree/agree:
I am committed to staying at Enron.	64.1%
Enron is a company I would invest my money in.	60.1%
I am treated with respect.	60.0%
I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family.	59.1%
I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing.	54.7%
Enron truly encourages people to take risks.	47.5%
My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	46.6%
Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	41.6%

_________________________________________________________________________________________

III.  We asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.

	More	Same	Less	N/A	
Concerned for communities	34.5%	44.9%	10.3%	10.3%	
Innovative	30.8%	35.7%	24.6%	8.9%	
Entrepreneurial	28.5%	37.8%	23.7%	10.0%	
Ethical	17.0%	45.1%	28.1%	9.8%	
Trustworthy	14.9%	39.0%	36.9%	9.2%	
Arrogant	39.1%	32.4%	13.3%	15.2%	
Self-serving	41.9%	38.6%	7.5%	12.0%	


_________________________________________________________________________________________
IV.  Finally, we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron.

1.	People (the high quality of people at Enron was the most widely-cited aspect):
---	talented
---	creative
---     learn from one another
2.	Culture and reputation:
---	innovative spirit
---   willingness to be aggressive and take risks
---   ability to embrace change
---   involvement in community
3.	Work environment:
---	pay and benefits
---   true meritocracy
---   unlimited opportunities

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A "meltdown" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact &amp; Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&amp;A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com &lt;http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY &amp; RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

Subject: Unreal!
Hello family and  friends.  I just received this message from, Youri, a friend of mine in  Europe.  He explains that this photo was apparently taken by a tourist  moments before the terrorist airline crash into the World Trade Center and that  the film/camera was found in the ruble and obviously developed.  If this is  real... can you imagine!!!!!!!!!  Totally disturbing, totally  unreal.

  <content type="text" name="message">Dear Mr. Lay:

I'm writing this note to you as a show of support to you during your dire
times.  The reason that I share this with you is my respect for you as a
CEO, a business leader and a person.  My wife is one of your employees who
routinely shares stories about you that are nothing less than inspiring.  I
know that during difficult times, sometimes words emerge that can help
people through difficult times.  I believe that you are sincere man and
know that you must be broken hearted, but I hope that this article can help
you lead a dispirted workforce to see things more clearly.  My wife, Shelly
Pierce, has worked for Enron for the past two years and like many of your
employees, has lost a great deal of her life savings.  Of course, I accept
most of the blame for this for reasons related to this article.  I lost my
investment discipline and held out the false hope that Enron could not
falter.  After reading the article to her while I was out of town, I
believe that her spirit was a bit rejuvenated and she was ready to face the
challenges that lay before you.

Mr. Lay, I appreciate the opportunity that you have given my wife and our
family and hope that this story inspires you to regain your successes.

"In recession, face brutal facts, thrive"
By Jim Collins

    A man in his early 20s recently asked me, "So what's a recession like?"
Its an entirely alien concept to him; he'd grown up during the greatest
economic boom in modern memory.  His question drove home the fact that we
haven't faced a severe, protracted economic setback for nearly 2 decades,
leaving us terribly unpracticed at dealing with tough times.
    With this recession - long in coming, perhaps long to stay - now
officially upon us, it is imperative that corporate leaders relearn a key
lesson about how great companies (and great people) deal with difficult
times differently from how they deal with merely good ones.  That lesson is
the "Stockdale Paradox," a peculiar psychology shown by those who emerge
from tough times not just intact, but stronger.
    Adm. Jim Stockdale was the highest-ranking U.S. military officer in the
Hanoi prison camp during the Vietnam War.  Tortured many times during his
8-year imprisonment, Stockdale lived without any prisoner's rights, no set
release date and no certainty as to whether he would ever again see his
family.
    He shouldered the burden of command while fighting an internal war
against his captors and their attempts to use the prisoners for propaganda.
At one point, he beat himself with a stool and cut himself with a razor,
deliberately disfiguring himself so that he could not be put on video as an
example of a "well-treated prisoner."  He exchanged secret intelligence
information with his wife through their letters knowing that discovery
would mean more torture and perhaps death.  After his release, Stockdale
became the first three-star officer in the history of the Navy to wear both
aviator wings and the Congressional Medal of Honor.
    You can understand, then, my anticipation at the prospect of spending
part of an afternoon with Stockdale, who happened to be at the Hoover
Institute across the street from my office when I taught at Stanford.  In
preparation, I read In Love and War, the book he and his wife wrote to
chronicle their experiences those 8 years.
    As I read the book, I found myself getting depressed.  It just seemed
so bleak - the uncertainty of his fate, the brutality of his captors.  And
then it dawned on me:  Here I am sitting in my warm comfortable office,
looking out over the Stanford campus on a beautiful Saturday afternoon.
I'm getting depressed reading this, and I know that he gets out, reunites
with his family and becomes a national hero.  If it feels depressing for
me, how on earth did he deal with it when he was actually there and did not
know the end of the story?
    "I never lost faith in the end of the story," Stockdale said when I
asked him.  "I never doubted not only that I would get out, but also that I
would prevail in the end and turn the experience into the defining event of
my life that, in retrospect, I would not trade."
    I didn't say anything for many minutes, and we continued the slow walk
toward the faculty club, Stockdale limping and arc-swinging his leg, still
stiff from repeated torture.  Finally, I asked, "Who didn't make it out?"
    "Oh, that's easy," he said.  "The optimists."
    "The optimists?  I don't understand," I said, completely confused.
    "The optimists.  Oh, they were the ones who said, 'We're going to be
out by Christmas.'  And Christmas would come, and Christmas would go.  Then
they'd say, 'We're going to be out by Easter.'  And Easter would come, and
Easter would go.  And then Thanksgiving, and then it would be Christmas
again.  And they died of a broken heart."
    After another long pause, he turned to me and said, "This is a very
important lesson.  You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in
the end - which you can never afford to lose - with the need for discipline
to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they
might be."
    My conversation with Stockdale had a profound influence on me, but I
never really considered it a business lesson until my research team began
to wrestle with the question of why some companies rise from difficulty to
become great while others emerge from those exact same difficulties
weakened and dispirited.  We found that companies that became great
embraced a corporate version of the Stockdale Paradox.
    Fannie Mae, for example found itself in the 1982 recession losing $1M
every business day, with $56B in loans under water.  Many analysts thought
Fannie Mae, which was getting 9% on its mortgage portfolio but paying 15%
on the debt it issued, was doomed.
   But CEO David Maxwell and his team never wavered in their aim to not
merely survive, but also to prevail as a great company.  Yes, they
confronted the brutal fact that the interest-rate problem was not going to
magically disappear (certainly not by Christmas).  But they used this grim
fact as a catalyst for creating an entirely new business model based on
asking three central questions of greatness:
        What can we potentially do better than any other company in the
        world?
        What can best drive our economic engine?
        What best ignites the passions of our people?
    Instead of reacting to the recession with mindless restructuring,
Fannie Mae rebuilt itself based on its answers to these questions.
Eventually, it generated investor returns nearly eight times those of the
general stock market.
    When asked how he dealt with the nay Sayers and the analysts who wrote
Fannie Mae off, Maxwell said that it was never an issue inside the company.
"Of course, we had to stop doing a lot of stupid things, but we never
entertained the possibility that we would fail.   We were going to use the
calamity as an opportunity to remake Fannie Maw into a great company."
    The sad truth is that most executive teams won't respond that way to
these dark days of uncertainty.  Instead of using this recession as an
opportunity to fundamentally rethink their business and rebuild a culture
of discipline, the will simply restructure, lay off a bunch of people and
liquidate their cultural equity.  Mediocre leaders will hold out false
hopes for a quick fix, only to watch those hopes be swept away by events.
Their companies will begin to die of a broken heart.
    It need not be this way.  Those who lead with the Stockdale Paradox -
those who retain the unwavering faith that they will find a way to prevail
in the end, but who also retain the discipline to confront the most brutal
facts of reality - will find this an ideal time to rebuild and reinforce
greatness.

    Used correctly, this recession can be a defining time in your firm's
history that , in retrospect, you would not trade.  Used wrongly, this
recession will weaken your foundations and make it that much harder to
become great.  The choice is yours.

I have asked both Ben Smith and Dan Leff to confirm
that these expenses will be paid so I can close the
office in Nevada.  It is a small amount but I can not
cover the cost for Enron out of my personal funds.
The total outstanding is $3,443.04.  Can you please
see that this gets paid ASAP.
Thanks and God Bless,
Chuck Allured

Ben, Leticia,
I hope this is not the last time we get to work
together.  As we discussed, I will have some office
closure expenses that I will need to get reimbursed
for.  I have been locked out of the server so I can
not enter them into the xms system.
This amounts to the following:

ATT wireless:
$212.71 November Billing
$90 Termination charge

Nevada Bell:
$170 November billing (est.)
$500 DSL Setup fee (November)
$49.95 November DSL monthly fee
$250 Termination Charge of one year contract

--------
$1,272.66 Total

Can you please process this and get $ to me asap so I
can disconnect all of the services?  You can reach me
at (775)832-2141 or cra123@yahoo.com

Thanks for all of the memories and may God bless us
all.
Chuck

In the event the foundation closes sooner rather  than later, I was wondering if each of you could possibly write me a letter of  recommendation.

  <content name="title" action="cluster">Three proposals, following up our recent meeting.</content>
  <content type="text" name="message">Dr. Kenneth L. Lay
Chairman of the Board
Enron Corp.


	Dear Dr. Lay,

We met less than a week ago, on Wednesday 16 May 2001, during the OECD Forum
2001 in Paris.

I'm an independent consultant and innovator, with a special interest in
energy and new technologies. I have more than ten years experience in
research and innovation in economics, business and technology.

I attended the session on energy you chaired during that OECD Forum. After
the session, I had a discussion with you. Unfortunately, your time was too
short. You gave me your card and asked me to write you.

As I told you, I think I can add value to your staff, bring new lines of
businesses to Enron and with them, many new clients. And above all,
unprecedented profits.

I am writing you to propose my contribution in these purposes. I'm mainly
making three proposals to Enron.

1.- Working for Enron as an external consultant.

Here, I would rather like to work on assignments, medium or long term, with
a preference for the following jobs: risk assessment and/or management,
strategic analysis on geopolitical, macroeconomics and societal issues. I
think these are important tasks for a company like Enron. The current
problems with Enron's Dabhol power plant in the Maharashtra state in India
stresses the kind of importance I'm mentioning.

I can also conduct surveys and provide Enron with technical and fruitful
information and policy recommendations. I've done a job like that recently,
on the oil-pipeline project in Chad and Cameroon. As you may already know,
this is a $4 billion project recently launched, with the support of the
World Bank, and led by three major energy firms: Exxon and Chevron of the
USA, and Petronas of Malaysia. I wrote a detailed and long report, which
combined public and private sectors' concerns, and also communities'
interests. Having operations worldwide, Enron I think needs the type of
technical works I've done on that major energy project.

I have a good expertise in energy economics. I attend international
congresses on that subject, for instance in Boston in January 2000. Since
more than five years, as a journalist or as an independent consultant, I
have been covering the works and studies of, or participated to workshops
and seminar organized by, the IEA (International Energy Association). I know
Mr. Robert Priddle, IEA chair, who also attended that energy session during
the OECD Forum 2001. I know the work he and his team of experts have been
doing.


2.- Being fully employed by Enron.

In this respect, I would prefer to work as a researcher for either Enron
Project Development and Management or Capital and Risk Management
departments. In these fields, I've also innovated. I've created among
concepts, tools and processes. For instance, the "Sensible Guide for
Action". This is a tool theoretically powerful and practically very
efficacious. It's main goal is to help decision-makers, in both private and
public sectors. The Sensible Guide for Action assists them in their approach
to solve technical problems. The SGA is a five-leaf bough.

I've also created a method to assess a firm capacity to create wealth. This
method can be adapted to fit some particular projects. The method is very
useful in countries where there's no stocks market, and where capital
markets are not sufficiently large. That's the case of underdeveloped
countries in general, where yet the energy demand if forecast to grow the
most in the coming decades. Enron cannot overlook this, or miss the business
and profit opportunities in this growth.


3.- The Business of Businesses.

Dear Dr Lay, if you accept this third proposal, it will probably be the best
investment Enron has ever made. I'm an independent researcher and
entrepreneur, with a strong quantitative analysis competence, and a
multidisciplinary background, both by education and professionally. I'm a
graduate in mathematics and in mechanical engineering (University of Paris)
and also in business and economics (Institut d'Etudes Politiques of Paris).

In this third proposal I'm bringing to Enron two key inventions I've made,
two types of financial products targeting consumers and companies. I believe
they will interest Enron.

These products have a market potential worldwide, unlimited. They will
create an entirely new industry: the business of businesses.

I'm currently looking for investors with whom I can launch those products.
We will be the world leader here, and remain in that position for a long
time before copycats try to reach us. I've created the products, and nobody
knows about them or about their extraordinary markets.

I started to talk to you about these products when we met, but you were
hurrying, and the many solicitations and noises of the Forum made it
difficult to explain my point. I'm writing you as you asked me, because
firstly I believe these products will interest Enron. Secondly I know how
these products will boost three types of Enron services: Online Marketplace;
Broadband Services; and Energy &amp; Commodities. Plus, these products, and the
business of businesses they create are an excellent placement for Enron.

Among the many reasons why I believe my products will interest Enron are
these:

(i) Their market is global.
(ii) They are directly related to consumption and savings.
(iii) They're excellent saving vehicles, for instance for pension or life
insurance.
(iv) They concern payment transactions and transmissions (And thanks to
information technology, costs here decrease while productivity will grow).
(v) They are both offline and online business (These products will be
excellent for Enron e-business).
(vi) I want to be and remain a global leader.
(vii) The products' growth potential is borderless
(viii) There's no competitor and before copycats arrive we would have
strongly imposed ourselves as The Leader and the Reference, increasing
chances that customers remain faithful to us.
(ix) My products will allow Enron to beat its competitors.
(x) Enron will earn a lot of revenues, many new clients, and very big and
unprecedented profits.

I'm looking for investors willing to put around $7 million. Given that the
revenues generated can very rapidly reach the range of $500 million to $1
billion, that initial $7 million is a wise and very profitable investment.

If you're interested, I'm ready to present the products and its business
scenario to you. The business model is very innovative, unprecedented.

These products' market is the whole world. But the first three markets I
would like to attack are the UK, Germany and moreover, Japan.

Today's news about Japan is rather bad. Economists and many observers see a
declining Japan. Me not. They may be right from a pure statistical and
macroeconomic viewpoint. But they fail to see deeper. They overlook the
other face of Japan. For my part, I see great business opportunities in
Japan, today and for the coming decade. Particularly for the financial
products I'm proposing.

These financial products I want Enron to launch with me in Japan, perfectly
fit Japanese consumption manners, their problematic pension system, and life
insurance structure there.

Public pension systems are under pressure every where, particularly in
Japan. In Germany they are trying to reform it. But there's no consensus in
the governments (federal and states') or in the Parliaments (federal and
states'). Last week, Chancellor Gerhard Schr?der won some parliamentary
approval. But the package he proposed is far from solving the issue.

In the meantime, problems may accumulate, the situation could worsen. What
seems sure is that in a foreseeable future, governments, not only in Germany
but in all developed and ageing countries, will no longer be able to pay
pensions at the level they have promised or are continuing to promise.

An additional bad news, even company pensions will suffer. In today's
"Financial Times" (Tuesday 22 May 2001, page 17), Peter Thompson, incoming
chairman of the British National Association of Pension Funds "warned UK
workers that they would no longer rely on comfortable company". He adds that
"many wold have to work until they were 75 -- 10 years longer than the
current retirement age - if they wanted to enjoy a financially comfortable
old age".

Therefore, workers and citizens should start, right no! to save for
themselves. My products are here the best saving vehicle I know.

And to what I know of Enron, it seems to me that Enron's shareholders also
will appreciate the kind of new business and investment opportunity I'm
bringing to their company. They will allow Enron to create a new and
unprecedented business model that all its competitors will envy. In a way,
Enron will change for its advantage, the way to do business in general, and
energy business in particular, thanks to the "business of businesses"
concept I've elaborated.


Dear Dr. Lay, as I read in Enron's web site, the list of awards you have
received: impressive. Congratulations! Two qualities common to all of them
are leadership and creativity. I wish these will help you to catch the
wonderful opportunity I'm bringing to you, in order to allow Enron to
accomplish a phenomenal progress.

Leadership and moreover creativity are also two qualities I've been trying
to put into practice. This effort creates a sort of affinity between us.
Thus, I think we can easily understand one another, speaking in some way,
the same language. Hence an additional reason that brings me to write you
and to make my proposal directly to you.

Given what I've learned of Enron's vision and values, I would like to stress
four of the twelve headings that are listed in Enron "vision and values"
page: innovation, diversity, change and excellence. Four headings that are
at work in each of the three proposals I've just made to you. When I knew
you were coming to that Forum, I prepared some materials for you and was
ready to present my proposals to you in details and to answer all your
questions. I'm still ready to do it. I'm even ready to come to Houston for
that purpose.


In one recent Enron's ad, I read : "Enron: Endless possibilities". Let's
make it true. Let's do it together. Let's reap the enormous benefits of "The
Business of Businesses"!

Thank you.

Best regards.

I wanted to inform you of an investment opportunity with Shawn Gross.   
 
He planning on developing a 2.5-acre tract at the corner of Kirby &amp;  Braeswood.  This location as you know is close to the medical center area  and surrounded quality old neighborhoods.  Two apartments in the area have  been very successful.  The Providence across the street is getting rental  rates in the $1.22 per square foot and Kirby Place, an older apartment complex,  is getting $1.13 per square foot.
 
The preliminary plan is to develop three or four story structures with a  total of approximately 110 or 150 units, respectively.  The total  project cost are projected to be $8.1 million or $10.9 million.  Capital  required for this development is between $1.6 million (for the three story  development) and $2.2 million (for the four story development).  An  additional call later on during development could be around $200,000 due to  increasing costs (i.e, increase in lumber prices).  The property would  probably be completed 18 months out.  Projected IRRs are between 20% to 28%  depending on the sale of the property.  Return on Cash Invested starts at  approximately 11% in 2002 and increases steadily up 20% around 2006.   Assumptions are: $1.22 per square foot rents; revenues &amp; expenditures rising  3.5%; vacancy loss of 5%; Cap Rate of 8.5%; total project cost between $8.1  million and $10.9 million, depending on three or four stories.  There is an  issue with the property being in the 100-Year Floodplain, but he is proposing to  alleviate the problem by creating a water feature on the property and raise the  grade of builderable area above the Floodplane.
 
I spoke to Jenard about the project before I've been able to discuss it  further with Shawn.  I asked him about some of the assumptions, such  as the rental rates and cap rates which I thought where a bit aggressive.   He told me to the contrary, that Shawn's other project is pulling in  similar rates, as well as other non-Shawn projects.  With regards to the  cap rate, he said that he has been seeing 8%, which would call for a greater  sales price than the assumed 8.5% (I can discuss this in further detail for  anyone who doesn't understand cap rates).  Jenard is investing 15% of  the capital required as a limited partner (same terms as the rest of the  partners) and Shawn is investing 5% (4% as a limited partner, 1% as GP).   Shawn will be the developer, JMG Builders will be doing the construction, and  JMG Managers, Ltd. will be managing the property.  In otherwords, Dad will  have his construction company and management company doing the project.   Shawn will be the developer.  While the property is under operation there  should be distributions (not treated as capital returned).  At the time of  sale, mortgage refinance, or other capital event, after all debts have been  repaid, all of the partners will get their capital contribution back.   Then, profits are distributed.  I can go through the partnership structure  for those who are interested, which includes distributions and fees.   
 
I am considering investing in 1% to 2% of the deal.  A 1% percent  investment amounts to either $16,000 or $22,000 invested, depending on the three  or four story scenario, plus the possible additonal cash call of $2,000.   There are several risks (i.e., softening of rental rates) which dooesn't make  the returns a guarantee.  However, I feel good about the Houston  economy and absorption rates in the residental (and commercial) markets for  Houston.  Feedback from Jenard regarding his developments in  Houston and Steve Keller's South Rice Apartment development have all been  extremely positive.  Shawn's personal developments include:  one in  Houston completed and doing great;  the other Houston project never got  developed because someone offered him so much money on the land, he and his  partners had to take it (not a bad problem considering it took the risk out of  developing and returned an enormous IRR to the investors).  Although he has  not developed much, his father is an investor and will have some  involvement.  Money invested would be tied-up for at least two years  (unless something happens like his last project), but up until a sale which  could take between 2 to 5 years (or longer) there could be distributions.   That assumes that the project is doing well.
 
Anyway, please let me know if any of you are interested.  The deal  is scheduled to fund June 10.  Like I said, I have not heard from him  on all the specifics.  Therefore, I don't know at this time how much is of  the deal is even available.  I would be glad to discuss this in greater  detail with any of you that are interested.

Mark, David Robyn &amp; Liz,
 
If you need cash, but don't want to sell stock or options, I have a  possible solution.  I am currently waiting for approval for a Line of  Credit (LOC) at PaineWebber.  I don't know how much each of you has  there, but I have all of my assets (stocks) held there, which includes managed  accounts (i.e., Cypress Asset &amp; TCW).  If you need funds for something,  such as a private investment, a new car or to pay down some other  more costly debt, then you can draw on this LOC up to 65% the value of the  collateral.  The terms of the LOC does not allow for the purchase public  equities (stocks).  I will say that we are getting the "family special" on  this, because this would typically only be offered to clients that had tens of  millions with PaineWebber.
 
The LOC terms are the following:
(1)  Must have combined assets > $550,000 held at  Painewebber (must be marketable securities, excludes PaineWebber alternative  investments)
(2)  Rate is 30 day-LIBOR plus 45 basis points (same rate  for KLL/LPL)
(3)  65% LTV
 
Alternatively, you can borrow on your margin account there if you already  have one.  However, the LTV is only 50%.
 
I notified Ann Bennett (PaineWebber) today that this might be of  interest for some of you.  You can call her directly at 713-957-7042 to set  this up.  I would be happy to discuss this further with any of you.

Enron taps credit line; stock slides

10/27/2001
Associated Press Newswires 
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. 

HOUSTON (AP) - After Enron Corp. tapped into more than $3 billion in credit in an effort to boost confidence of investors and customers, stock prices dropped. 

Enron Corp.'s stock price hit its lowest point in more than five years Friday. Shares fell 95 cents on Friday to $15.40, a level not seen since 1995, as analysts continued to muddle through a complicated series of bookkeeping issues revealed after the company's earnings announcement earlier this month.

The stock is down more than 50 percent in two weeks, and the company lost almost $14 billion in market value. 

Late this week the company decided to convert $3 billion in revolving credit it has through various banks into cash. The company put about $1.1 billion in the bank in an effort to reassure business partners and investors of its liquidity and is using the $2.2 billion balance to begin an orderly repurchase of a certain kind of short-term corporate IOU known as commercial paper. 

"Nothing spells confidence quite like cash, which is what we want investors to understand," said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer of the $1.1 billion banked this week. 

Palmer could neither confirm nor deny that the company is negotiating further lines of credit with banks but described such actions as "good management decisions." 

On Oct. 16 Enron's third-quarter earnings release drew renewed attention to an issue investors and analysts had previously been unhappy about: Then-Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, with the Enron board's approval, had formed and run two investment partnerships that could have created a conflict of interest. 

The partnerships, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron. 

Fastow had resigned from his roles in the partnerships months ago when Wall Street began to question whether he could watch out for the interests of Enron's shareholders and the investment partnership simultaneously. But last week when the company reported a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity, new questions began to arise. 

The Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Enforcement launched an informal inquiry into the partnerships, and earlier this week Fastow was put on a leave of absence. 

Reducing the company's debt exposure through commercial paper and putting it back into more traditional financial tools, like a revolving line of credit, could give great peace of mind to Enron's investors, said Anatol Feygin, an analyst with J.P. Morgan. 

"It helps them shore up their support behind their energy trading business, which is really the core of their operations," Feygin told the Houston Chronicle for Saturday's editions. 

Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities, still sees the move as somewhat confusing. 

"Just last week they were touting their unused lines of credit as a plus, but the fact that they tapped those now sends a strange, mixed message," she said. "Do they need the cash to keep the rating agencies off their back? Is it a gesture for customers? It first struck me as another one of these strangely timed actions on the part of management."

Turning Up the Heat: 

Energy trader Enron ousted its chief financial officer days after it said the SEC was conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it made with entities tied to the CFO, Andrew S. Fastow. Enron said Fastow took a leave of absence to restore investor confidence. Enron shares have plunged 50% recently, after it announced the probe and reported a $618 million loss.

Bulls Look To Recovery, As Techs Lead The Surge 
By Andrew Barry 


-- In what undoubtedly will become a business-school case study, Enron let potentially containable concerns about some asset writedowns and a formerly obscure group of partnerships mushroom into a full-blown financial crisis last week. 

Enron's stock plunged 10.60 to 15.45, following a 10-point drop in the prior week, and the company's bonds fell sharply as yields rose to junk levels of around 10%. By week's end, Enron had drawn down $3 billion in bank credit lines to pay off nearly $2 billion in maturing commercial paper, leaving it only about $1 billion of net liquidity. 

Enron's big energy trading operation, which accounts for the bulk of the company's profits and most of its equity valuation, now may be vulnerable because it hinges on a solid credit rating and the confidence of trading counterparties. Enron faces potential debt downgrades from the major rating agencies, but the company is likely to remain an investment-grade credit. Moody's Investors Service now rates its debt Baa1, three notches above junk. 

One doomsday scenario is that counterparties on existing Enron trades, concerned about Enron's viability, push for settlement of the trades, precipitating the kind of liquidity crisis that engulfed Long-Term Capital Management in 1998. 

Despite entreaties by friendly Wall Street analysts to come clean about its financial situation, Enron has resisted, refusing to disclose the size of potential liabilities involving Enron-created partnerships whose debt is guaranteed by Enron. 

Enron called a conference call Tuesday to clear the air, but it ended up compounding its problems by failing to answer questions posed by a Boston investor about the Marlin partnership, leaving Wall Street with the clear impression that the company faces a nearly $1 billion loss on that deal. 

Some suspect that Enron stonewalling is motivated by fears that further disclosure will expose the inadequacy of the asset coverage behind its partnerships and thus significant Enron liabilities that will impair the company's credit ratings. There may also be the need for potential writedowns of various Enron assets, including its money-losing broadband business. 

Enron now trades at only a slight premium to its second-quarter book value of $13 a share, but it's worth noting that tangible book, excluding goodwill, was only $9 a share. Book value fell in the third quarter by an undetermined about because of Enron's $1 billion asset writedown and its still-mysterious $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity related to one of its partnerships. The third-quarter book value won't be known until Enron releases its balance sheet, which may not occur until its quarterly 10-Q is released. 

The Enron situation is another black eye for Wall Street research. The company was a Street favorite for years because of its strong and consistent profit growth. Enron was able to get away with providing minimal disclosure about its energy trading activities and its partnerships because analysts and investors didn't demand it. The Enron bull case essentially boiled down to the company's leadership in the booming energy trading markets and analysts' confidence in management. The Street really didn't provide much more insight than that into a company that at one point had a $75 billion valuation. That value has since shrunk to $14 billion. 

Enron's woes also show how equity analysts pay too little attention to company balance sheets. Until last week, Enron analysts still were more focused on earnings dilution than the more important issue of Enron's financial health. 

Enron had about $15 billion in debt and preferred stock outstanding at the end of the second quarter and an undetermined amount of guaranteed off-balance-sheet debt. Enron clearly ignored the importance of its balance sheet, allowing it to grow enormously over the past few years. Judging from the company's rather meager credit lines, Enron apparently figured nobody would ever doubt the financial strength of the king of the energy markets.

City - Enron directors cash in shares.
By Simon English.

LEADING executives at Enron, the troubled US energy giant, cashed in shares worth more than $100m ( #70m) this year in the run-up to a financial crunch that has left the company's credibility in ruins. 

Research by Thomson Financial shows that Kenneth Lay, chief executive, sold about 400,000 shares this year, netting him more than $25m. He still held 2.8m shares until July.

Other executives made similar sales, a revelation likely to anger investors who have seen the shares fall from $83 at the start of the year to $45 by July. They halved again this week and fell to below $16 yesterday. Enron declined to comment on the share sales. 

Mr Lay said in a statement that he is seeking to "dispel uncertainty in the financial community" by drawing on lines of credit to restore faith in Enron's financial strength. Enron will pay off debts of $2.2 billion and keep another $800,000 in cash. He said: "We know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community." 

The company is facing an inquiry by the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission into partnerships managed by Andrew Fastow, former chief financial officer. 

Mr Fastow was ousted on Wednesday night as part of the company's moves to restore confidence, though Enron insists he has done nothing wrong. 

Enron lost $1 billion in the third quarter on what it has called "failed investments".

ENRON STOCK SINKS TO 5-YEAR LOW 

Energy trading giant Enron Corp., its stocks hammered by a potential credit crunch and its chief financial officer's ouster, fell to its lowest close in more than five years on Friday. The fall was sparked by word of a big quarterly loss and a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into the ousted CFO's links to some of Enron's partnerships. Enron stock closed at $15.50, off 85 cents or 5.2 percent, on the New York Stock Exchange.

Enron Taps Credit Line; Stock Slides

Enron Corp.'s stock price hit its lowest point in more than five years Friday after it tapped into more than $3 billion in revolving credit in an effort to re-assure investors and customers. 

Shares fell 95 cents on Friday to $15.40, a level not seen since 1995, as analysts continued to muddle through a complicated series of bookkeeping issues revealed after the company's earnings announcement earlier this month. The stock is down more than 50 percent in two weeks, and the company lost almost $14 billion in market value.

Late this week the company decided to convert $3 billion in revolving credit it has through various banks into cash. The company put about $1.1 billion in the bank in an effort to reassure business partners and investors of its liquidity and is using the $2.2 billion balance to begin an orderly repurchase of a certain kind of short-term corporate IOU known as commercial paper. 

"Nothing spells confidence quite like cash, which is what we want investors to understand," said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer of the $1.1 billion banked this week. 

Palmer could neither confirm nor deny that the company is negotiating further lines of credit with banks but described such actions as "good management decisions." 

Enron's most recent woes began Oct. 16 when its third-quarter earnings release drew renewed attention to an issue investors and analysts had previously been unhappy about: Then-Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, with the Enron board's approval, had formed and run two investment partnerships that could have created a conflict of interest. 

The partnerships, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron and were formed originally as a way to offset risks associated with some of the company's newer businesses such as broadband trading. 

Fastow had resigned from his roles in the partnerships months ago when Wall Street began to question whether he could watch out for the interests of Enron's shareholders and the investment partnership simultaneously. But last week when the company reported a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity, new questions began to arise. 

Analysts began to demand more details behind the workings of the partnerships, details that Enron did not provide as quickly as some would have liked. 

Enron Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay told analysts and investors the company was careful to ensure that the interests of Enron and its shareholders were protected, but The Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Enforcement launched an informal inquiry into the partnerships, and earlier this week Fastow was put on a leave of absence. 

In drawing down the $3.3 billion line of revolving credit this week, the company put about $1.1 billion in the bank to ensure liquidity and is using the balance to begin an orderly repurchase of its commercial paper. 

Now Enron will begin repurchasing its commercial paper. This is a way for companies to raise money over a short period at rates that are usually slightly better than what banks offer, and often with more flexible terms. 

Investors in commercial paper -- who are actually more like lenders, since it's actually a form of debt -- are often fund managers who often have large sums of extra cash in search of short-term investments. 

The investors like commercial paper because it lets them earn money on cash that would sit idle otherwise and lets them do it through something issued only by companies with top credit ratings and usually backed by bank lines of credit. 

"To some extent, redeeming the commercial paper is at the expense of the capital markets, which look at it negatively," said Anatol Feygin, an analyst with J.P. Morgan. 

But reducing the company's debt exposure through commercial paper and putting it back into more traditional financial tools, like a revolving line of credit, could give great peace of mind to Enron's investors, he said. 

"It helps them shore up their support behind their energy trading business, which is really the core of their operations," Feygin said. 

Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities, still sees the move as somewhat confusing. 

"Just last week they were touting their unused lines of credit as a plus, but the fact that they tapped those now sends a strange, mixed message," she said. "Do they need the cash to keep the rating agencies off their back? Is it a gesture for customers? It first struck me as another one of these strangely timed actions on the part of management." 

Jeff Dietert, an analyst at Simmons &amp; Co., said Enron management needs to continue to make clear the issues that have investors confused and concerned. 

In a worst-case scenario, investor fears could create a vicious cycle that continues to drive the stock down, which would force bond rating agencies to consider downgrades of Enron. That could lead to lower credit ratings, which would force Enron's energy trading partners to limit their exposure to the company and cut back on business with it. 

"Thus, we see a big incentive for Enron to clarify the issues," Dietert wrote in a report Friday. "Our gut feel is that Enron can pull it off." 

Feygin said he also believes the company will continue to do better in revealing its financial dealings but thinks there may be more surprises in store. 

For example, a Wall Street Journal article Friday discussed for the first time another business entity with ties to Enron known as Chewco. It was formed in 1997 with about $400 million in financial backing to buy interests in unnamed Enron assets. 

Chewco was run by Michael Kopper, a managing director of Enron's Global Equity Markets Group. 

"Frankly, that was the first time I had ever heard of that entity," Feygin said. "Until now, everything that's come out I've at least heard of or had some idea of what they were from the company's filings or discussions. This is something I had never heard of before."

Enron Taps All Its Credit Lines To Buy Back $3.3 Billion of Debt
By FLOYD NORRIS

The New York Times 
Page 2, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company 

The Enron Corporation, trying to reassure investors that it has ample liquidity, began to repurchase all its outstanding commercial paper yesterday, using $3.3 billion it borrowed from banks by depleting its lines of credit. 

An Enron spokesman said that when the commercial paper repurchases are completed the company will retain more than $1 billion in cash.

The moves did not appear to reassure investors, as Enron's share price fell to another six-year low. Shares traded as low as $15.04 yesterday, before ending the day at $15.40, down 95 cents. 

The move will raise the interest expense for the company, because banks normally charge more than companies have to pay in the commercial paper market, and because its outstanding debt will rise by the additional $1 billion. 

Enron's debt is rated investment grade. But its bonds now trade below investment grade levels, although not so low that it appears investors fear an early default. But with the bonds trading so low, it is unlikely Enron will be able to sell more commercial paper. 

Enron's stock has been plunging since Oct. 17, shortly after it disclosed that its third-quarter balance sheet, which has yet to be released, will show a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity as a result of complicated transactions involving partnerships formerly controlled by Andrew Fastow, who was the company's chief financial officer until he was replaced on Wednesday. 

The stock has lost more than half its value since the earnings announcement, and the company has disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission has asked questions about its accounting practices.

Enron Decline Continues

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. bonds and shares fell after the largest energy trader tapped a $3-billion credit line because it has been shut out of the leading market for low-interest, short-term loans. 

The company's stock has fallen 54% in the last 14 days after investors questioned its transactions with affiliates run by Enron's former chief financial officer. The shares fell 95 cents, or 5.8%, to $15.40 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Investors said Chief Executive Kenneth Lay has failed to reassure them that the company's credit rating won't be cut. Enron can no longer borrow in commercial paper markets, where short-term loans carry lower rates than banks offer. 

"Do they have the financial flexibility they once had? No," said John Cassady, who helps manage $3 billion in bonds at Fifth Third Bancorp. "People are questioning the credibility of management." 

The company will use its credit line to pay off $2.2 billion in commercial paper it has outstanding, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said. 

The price of Enron's 6.75% bonds, which mature in 2009, declined 11/2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86 cents. At that price, the bonds, which carry a rating of BBB+, yield 9.53%. 

Investors have grown concerned that the firm's credit rating will be cut after $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses from failed investments. Enron needs good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions. 

Enron's decision to tap its credit line was "a smart financial move," said Stephen Moore of Moody's Investors Service. "It took away the hassle and time-consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and insured access to capital."

Enron, the Houston-based energy trading giant, continued to pay the price for financial opacity as its stock slumped to its lowest level since 1995 and its five-year bonds traded at 77 cents in the dollar with a yield of 11.13 per cent, down from 83 cents on Thursday. Bond prices at these levels normally suggest that investors expect a company to file for bankruptcy. Page 10.

Jeff, Congratulations, you deserve the job and can do it superbly!  You know you will need to replace Ben Gilson as Treasurer - possibly with Bill Brown.  

My issue, and I feel very strongly about this, is that I want to be on the crisis management team to determine how we save our trading franchise.  It can disappear over night and I believe there's more bad news coming re: these raptor deals (ie, restatement).  I have clearly proven myself to be the only person at Enron that had the character, at great risk to my own career, much less personal risk, to go to Ken Lay and let him know what was going on here.  I resent all these late comers joining the band wagon - it's damn easy to make a statement now, when Ken has made the hard decision to unwind these deals and write them off.  Mainly I resent being stuffed into a holding tank, I should not be the pariah here!  Despite your comment to me several weeks ago when I told you that's how I felt and you replied "what did you expect?"  I have been professional in this 100%, I went to Ken and Ken alone, in contrast to yesterday's VP Jim S. who put Ken on the spot by asking unanswerable questions at the all employee meeting. I hope to meet with Ken Lay soon.  But I'd like to talk to you about my role in the 'inner circle', because I firmly believe I deserve it and have proven so by my past evaluations of the negative impact of these structures and then by my actions in doing something about it.  You can help me with your endorsement of me to Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and Ken Lay.  I hope I have it.  Thanks and good luck in the new job, Sherron

Subject:	Jeff McMahon Named CFO


Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.</content>

  <content type="text" name="message">Ken,

Thank you for your response to my email.  Whether you actually took the
time to respond or left it to one of your assistants, I hope you read my
comments/suggestions and truly understood them.

I have a few more comments and suggestions!

You are correct, overall stock values have declined and Enron has some
additional, unique issues related to its broadband and tele-com
business, payments from California and large investments in foreign
power plants, particularly India.  However, I cannot agree with your
comments (or Jeff's) about short sellers.

Short sellers, like jackals and vultures, exist for a reason and are an
important part of the whole financial community in which we live.  Short
sellers (and Jackals) are always looking for a deal(meal).  When they
find an unhealthy company (animal), they investigate, which oftens leads
to greater opportunities.  Enron, under Jeff's leadership, was not
healthy and the short sellers (jackals) found a wonderful opportunity.

Your current job, as was Jeff Skilling's, is to not provide the short
sellers (jackals) a reason or opportunity to focus on Enron's stock
price.

I applaud your recent commitment to the financial community to provde
better definition regarding Enron's profits.  Developing the necessary
internal mechanism for a largely transparent financial reporting system
will police itself and will ultimately reinforce confidence in Enron's
true value.

As an economist, you need to remember that the market value of any
company, in today's economy, is largely based on the market's perception
of its value. As you and I have so recently seen, the market very often
reacts on preception and only looks at intrinsic value as an
afterthought.  The financial community believes that if it quacks like a
duck and walks like a duck, then....just maybe it is a duck and not
really a racehorse

Enron executives need to be more cognizant of the negative impact their
excessive insider selling of shares has on market preception.  Using
stock options in lieu of salary is a very powerful incentive but it can
also backfire, especially if the proper safe guards are not in place.
Excessive insider trades can and should be limited.

Doing good things for the right reasons works! For some years now,
Northern's leadership has not done many good things for the right
reasons.  They are highly political and have developed a nasty habit of
not telling their upper management (Stan Horton) the truth, but what
Stan wants to hear.  They are doing many things, not because they
should, but becaue they can get away with them.  This activity works
only as long as their customers do not have a choice!  You want
examples-look at the non-Enron pipeline activity in Florida and the
upper midwest.

A solid domestic asset with a reasonable return is much better than the
possibility of much higher returns on assets in unstable, foreign
markets.  Enron is not smarter than the world and the world has
certainly demonstrated that it will not allow Enron to possess very much
control over world affairs.  Let's learn from our mistakes!

Selling difficult assets, such as in India, is good.  Selling profitable
assets, such as Portland General is bad just to make the bollom line
revenue. Warren Buffet, an Omaha native, does not look like such an old
fuddy-duddy as he once did, as recently as last year.  Strong, solid
fandamentals do count and ......

Short sellers will always be around and DOING GOOD THINGS FOR THE RIGHT
REASONS truly works!!!

Sincerely,

Neal Shaw

Neal:

I appreciate your recent e-mail concerning the decline in Enron's stock
price.  I share with you a very deep disappointment and frustration
about
this decline.

The decline has occurred for a number of reasons.  First, overall stock
values have declined significantly this year.  Enron's stock price has
declined more than averages primarily because of the total melt down in
the
broadband and tele-com business, difficulties with getting paid by the
California utilities and trouble with our large power plant and LNG
project
in India.  These problems have been further compounded by endless
misinformation and rumors, probably promulgated by short sellers.

In any event, I believe we our making progress in addressing these
various
problems.  I believe our stock price will increase over the short to
intermediate term.  With good success, we will be able to restore most
or
all of the value we lost this year over the not too distant future.

I appreciate your concerns and your suggestions and I will certainly do
everything I can to restore your confidence in Enron.

Sincerely,

Ken

   Ken,

   My name is Neal Shaw and I worked for Northern Natural Gas Company in
   Midland, Minneapolis and Omaha in the Marketing Department of Enron's
   Gas Pipeline Group for almost 19 years.  I left the company is
December
   2000. I have a major portion of my investment portfolio in Enron
shares.

   I just read an interesting article titled Sizing up CEO aplomb under
   duress a major concern. by Jamie Lareau.  This article focused on how
to
   recognize CEO's and CEO candidates who were not up to the
requirements
   of their job and used Jeff Skilling as an example.  I have agreed
with
   views of this journalist for some time, especially since Jeff called
a
   fund manager an "asshole".  Publically calling someone is simply Not
   something any CEO should do and you and Enron's board should have
done
   something about Jeff then.

   My point is as follows:  Where were you and the Enron Board during
all
   this?  Why have you let people like Jeff Skilling and Stan Horton
   virtually destroy all growth prospects for the pipelines and totally
   concentrate on trying to make money without an asset base?  A lot of
   people believed Jeff's hype and many people have suffered!  Has Jeff
   suffered?.  I think not especially since he has left Enron with
millions
   of our dollars in his pocket.  Hopefully he will be able to afford
the
   time off to "find himself".

   Did you see the movie "Top Gun"?  Toward the end of the movie, Tom
   Cruise, otherwise know as Maverick, blamed himself for the loss of
his
   friend and simply disengaged from combat flying.  However, when
things
   got really rough, Maverick re-engaged the enemy and did what he was
   hired to do.

   Do you know where this is going?

   You are once again Enron's "Top Gun"!  The enemy is Enron's depressed
   stock price.  It is time for you to re-engage and live up to your
title
   of "Top Gun" and CEO!  I and the rest of Enron's stock holders need
you
   to repair the damage Jeff did and STOP the damage people like Stan
   Horton are currently doing and get Enron back in the mix.

   I sincerely hope you are still capable of doing a good job.  If you
are
   not, refund your salary since Jeff took over and step down.

   Neal Shaw

Subject:	Community Partners' Stabilization/Transition Campaign

Misha and Jennifer:  Thanks for visiting with me this week regarding Community Partners and our ongoing campaign.  Give me a call so I can schedule a tour for you two.
Cindy:  I regret that you were unable to join us but I did want to include you in this follow-up email requested by Misha and Jennifer, and to invite you to a tour of our clinic.

Background:   As you know, Enron (the old HNG) was a founding member of Community Partners (once known as Urban Affairs Corp.) and has been an on-going contributor to the non-profit for all of its 25+ year history.  Begun as an effort by the business community in Houston to increase the number of female minorities in the workforce by providing low-cost daycare to children of inner-city mothers, Community Partners has grown into a $2+ million annual budget organization whose emphasis now is school-based health clinics.  These clinics, including a mobile clinic operated in cooperation with Episcopal Health Charities and Christ Cathedral-downtown, are utilized by the UT-Health Sciences and UT Nursing Schools as teaching facilities for their students, interns and residents, and as a result,  we are able to offer a full-year of unlimited health care at a cost of approximately $100 per individual served -- a significant savings when compared to costs associated with government programs at charity hospitals.  Our associated childcare facility housed in an HISD school adjacent to our main clinic allows young school-age mothers to remain in school by providing care for infants and pre-schoolers while the students attend classes.

Prior Giving History:  For the first 15-20 years of its existence, Enron historically made an annual $25,000 contribution to the non-profit and in the last 10-years has annually purchased a $10,000 table at the Fathers of the Year Luncheon, which has become a one of Houston's most recognized luncheon fund-raisers.  Ken Lay has been honored and has served in numerous years as Honorary Chairman of the event, and he and his foundation normally buys a $25,000 table.   When EOG was an Enron subsidiary, Forrest Hoglund, chaired the event one year and the Hoglund Foundation has been a regular contributor.   Enron's Adopt-a-Child Holiday Program actually got its start in association with Community Partners when Enron employees would adopt and buy gifts for children in our childcare centers.  Over the last several years, Enron's contribution has been reduced to a $10,000 annual table purchase associated with the Fathers of the Year Luncheon.

Update on Community Partners:  After serving on the Board for 15+ years (two years as Chairman), the one thing I have learned about a non-profit like Community Partners is that there is never much surplus cash, especially at year-end, and we are always waiting for that next contribution.  Every year we have been able to squeeze by, but this year, because of a number of circumstances, Community Partners is in a severe battle for survival.  Because of personal health problems experienced by Executive Director Donna Bryant, her husband, Don, and son, Jason, the Board earlier this year decided to acquire the services of a fund-raising consulting group headed by Harriet Lattimer and Tom Herren to help us through this crisis and to make recommendations.  The Board overwhelmingly endorsed their recommendations which included the following:
Promoting Donna Bryant to a Chairman Emeritus position with continued salary over the next three years.  Donna would have no day-to-day duties, which will allow her to take care of her own health needs and to transition to retirement.  She would be called on only, as needed, on a consulting basis.   
Seeking $500,000 in immediate transition/stabilization support from certain foundations who have voiced interest in providing that support to keep this important program going.  (Grant requests of $250,000 each have been submitted to the Meadows Foundations and the Cullen Foundation.)
Beginning an immediate search for an Executive Director (with the enthusiastic assistance of Jackie Martin and her United Way staff) and to consider the hiring of a Development Director to focus on fundraising.   FYI:  I talked with Roy Hughes and have forwarded his resume to the Board search committee.
Refocusing of the Houston Endowment $150,000 annual grant to the clinics and requesting immediate payment.  (Accomplished) 
Strengthening of the Board of Directors.  (I have agreed to chair the Nominating Committee so any ideas you can contribute would be appreciated.)
Reapplying for United Way membership.  (We once were a UW agency but Donna did not like the limitations to fundraising  ... under the current circumstances, the Board now thinks otherwise.)
Beginning an immediate personal Board contribution campaign and to seek stabilization funding this year from the Houston community, both from corporations and individuals.   (Already underway.)
Consider a major endowment campaign next year to provide emergency cash flow in times when we are waiting for the foundation checks to come in.

Enron's Role??:  In addition to an immediate stabilization gift of $25,000 to $50,000 to help us through the remainder of the year, we would appreciate the consideration of a major gift in the $100,000+ range over a 3-5 year period for the Endowment Campaign.   We would also like a top Enron executive (Ken Lay would be nice, but it could be a nice intro to the Community for Mark Frevert or Greg Whalley) to consider chairing the Endowment Campaign once it gets organized next year.  I would also consider stepping down from the Board to allow a more high-level executive to represent us on the Board.

I apologize for the long-winded nature of this message, but I wanted to make sure that everyone knew all the facts.   Thanks for your consideration.

  <content type="text" name="message">Dear Family and Friends,

Ken and I have invited my father and his two lady friends (Cathy Hofgren and
Mary Walsh) to visit us at the Huntingdon in Houston for a long weekend.
The visit has been scheduled for late Thursday evening, October 11 until the
afternoon of Monday, October 15.  Unless the horrific events of the past two
weeks and it's aftermath causes some unforeseen problem, we will move
forward with their visit.  Pop-Pop is anxious to "catch up" and see everyone
in the family and some of our friends; he particularly wants to see his
precious great grand children.  Considering his age and the difficulty in
the logistics for him to see everyone, we are planning one big "extended"
family/friends casual dinner for Friday, October 12 @5:30 p.m. in the Pool
Room @River Oaks Country Club.  Mark your calendars and hopefully, most of
you will be available to join us.

I am aware of two noteworthy events in October; the first is Sharon Lay's
birthday on October 8th and the second is Halloween.  Therefore, if Sharon
is able to attend, we will have a Halloween birthday party.  With Halloween
as our theme, we will have "FRIENDLY" costumes for all children attending
and games to play.

Jessica will be e-mailing you with a guest list and getting a definite head
count, as we get closer to Pop-Pop's arrival.  If any of you have other
family members or friends who would enjoy seeing Pop-Pop and/or celebrating
Sharon's birthday and you would like for them to join us, please let me
know.

Lots of Love, Mom/Linda

Family and Friends,
I just received this e-mail from a  girlfriend of mine and wanted to share her first hand accounts with you.   It put a lump in my throat and brought tears to my eyes.  I ache for those  people, all people, our nation and our world.  May God bless you, and  may you feel blessed each and every day by his presence!

Hi,
First, let me thank you again  for your thoughts and concerns.  
I did make it out of the city for a  long weekend and truly got to unwind.  Many people out in the Hamptons are  contributing to the cause in several ways and like the rest of the country the  mood is somber. However, life is still beautiful there.  I rode my bicycle  everyday, canoed, walked on the beach and went to interesting dinners.  But  then I came back.  The bus I was on was stopped and searched before  entering the Midtown tunnel, which leads into the city.   Everyone,  including the driver was asked for picture ID.  I came back because Monday  evening started the Jewish New Year and I had dinner with my family in the city.   After dinner, my brother-in-law, my cousin (visiting from Israel) and I  went downtown to ground zero.  It is off limits to anyone other than the  military, firefighters and the police, but I got this unique opportunity to  enter the belly of the beast because my friend who has a restaurant down in  Tribeca set up a hot meal zone in one of the damaged buildings.  He and his  staff are the only non officials allowed there.  I went to help serve.   Getting down was a struggle in itself.  I passed through many  blockades guarded by the military, and finally had a police escort get me all  the way down.  No matter how I describe what I saw, I couldn't possibly  give an accurate picture of the devastation.  The only thing I can tell you  is that it is so much larger in life.  The piece of facade of one of the  towers that you have seen on the news and in all the papers spans one full city  block.  There were firefighting crews from California, Ohio, Indiana and  more.  I spoke with many. 
Yesterday I went to synagogue.  The  experience was intense.  We waited on a line that went around the block  before going through metal detectors to get in.  I sat next to a Managing  Director of Cantor Fitzgerald, who was late to work on Tuesday.  He lost  all 200 of his staff as well as 500 who did not work directly for him.  The  woman in front of me lost her son.  We had several firefighters visit the  temple and, as you can imagine, they walked into a full five minutes of cheers  and applause.  It was so touching.  No dry eyes.
I realize I'm  rambling but thought you might be interested in a first hand account.
All  my best to you,
Joyce

Hello family and friends,
 
I am in charge of collecting shoes for the needy  (C.C.S.C.) via Nicholas' class at River Oaks Baptist School.  These shoes  can be children's, men's, women's.  These shoes can be slippers, tennis  shoes, boots, dress shoes or good ole fashion walking shoes.  I am  more than happy to do a pick up so that you do not have to go out of your  way.  One pair or many pairs, I'll take what I can get to help out people  that NEED shoes.  Let me know if you have any and when it is convenient for  me to pick them up.  The annual shoe drive ends on October 4th so please  clean out your closets before then and give away what you are not going to  use.
 
Thank you and God Bless,

Hello all,
 
I am not a pass along e-mail kind of person  but when it is related to health.... you just never know when it might help  someone.  Please read the following which was sent to me and I am now  forwarding it onto you.  Hope you never have to use this technique of  course but education to situations always helps.

Dear Friends,
This was shared throughout a group from our church and sounds like
worthwhile, simple info.  Can't hurt to try it if the need arises!
Love and Blessings, Margaret and JohnHEART ATTACK SELF HELPThis is NOT a chain letter.
If everyone who gets this sends it to 10 people, you can bet that we'll
save at least one life.
Let's say it's 6:15 p.m. and you're driving home (alone of course),
after an unusually hard day on the job. You're really tired, upset and
frustrated. Suddenly you start experiencing severe pain in your chest
that starts to radiate out into your arm and up into your jaw. You are
only
about five miles from the hospital nearest your home; unfortunately
you don't know if you'll be able to make it that far. What can you do?
You've been trained in CPR but the guy that taught the course neglected
to
tell you how to perform it on yourself.
HOW TO SURVIVE A HEART ATTACK WHEN ALONE
Since many people are alone when they suffer a heart attack, this
article
seemed to be in order. Without help, the person whose heart stops
beating
properly and who begins to feel faint, has only about 10 seconds left
before losing consciousness.
However, these victims can help themselves by coughing repeatedly and
very vigorously. A deep breath should be taken before each cough, and
the
cough must be deep and prolonged, as when producing sputum from deep
inside the chest.
Deep breath and a cough must be repeated about every two seconds without
let up until help arrives, or until the heart is felt to be beating
normally
again. Deep breaths get oxygen into the lungs and coughing movements
squeeze the heart and keep the blood circulating.
The squeezing pressure on the heart also helps it regain normal rhythm,
this way, heart attack victims can get to a hospital.
Tell as many other people as possible about this, it could save their
lives!

Enron Is History, Says History
By HOLMAN W. JENKINS JR.

November 28, 2001
Business World

Back in the mid-1980s, a pipeline executive called Ken Lay was fishing
around for a name for his company, produced by a merger of Houston Natural
Gas and Omaha-based InterNorth. He consulted with consultants, politicked
with politicians, and came up with a moniker. The company would be called
"Enteron."

Three weeks later, fed up with the wisecracks from a press that had looked
up the dictionary definition of "enteron" (n. the intestine), he changed the
company's name again. Henceforth it would be known as Enron.

A columnist less devoted to high standards of decorum might be tempted to
extend the metaphor of the company's misbegotten name. In recent weeks,
after all, we've seen Enron's stock collapse over indigestible accounting
and the emergence of dealings between the company and its senior officers
that exude an odor of genuine malfeasance. The evidence is far from clear,
but for the sake of Mr. Lay's reputation one hopes these missteps will prove
one more case of a company fooling itself rather than setting out
deliberately to defraud the markets.

Enron grew to be much more than a pipeline hauler of natural gas, becoming
the pre-eminent trader and marketer of all kinds of energy contracts and a
vocal proponent of deregulation. Now, all but overnight, it's kaput, just
waiting to find out if its fate will be bankruptcy or absorption by an
erstwhile rival.

We cannot help be put in mind of another commodity wunderkind in the 1970s,
Phibro (short for Philipp Brothers). Hard to believe, but Phibro was once a
name that made grown men quiver on Wall Street. Fattened by trading profits
from the great commodity inflation of the 1970s, which some mistook for a
permanent new age of scarcity, it scooped up the Street's oldest
partnership, Salomon Brothers, tucking it into its back pocket and renaming
the combined firm Phibro-Salomon. Here was a powerhouse of unlimited
potential, investors told themselves.

Flash ahead to California's electricity meltdown earlier this year. Enron
saw its revenues quadruple partly as a result of the inflated prices being
quoted in the California market. Many foresaw a new scarcity megatrend, but
there was no true energy shortage. Posted prices on the California power
exchange may have skyrocketed, but the effective price was zero dollars and
zero cents, because the utilities had no cash to pay and politicians were
thumbing their noses at piles of IOUs.

When prices are zero, suppliers take a hike -- that's what economics
teaches. But once the state government started pumping its own cash into the
market, the phony posted prices plummeted and supplies became plentiful
again. Now California is swimming in power and nobody talks about an "energy
crisis" anymore.

You can date the loss of investor confidence in Enron almost exactly to the
moment when the California fiasco began to repair itself. Fortune Magazine
put the inaugural nail in Enron's coffin in March, noting that the company's
growing dependence on trading had turned it into an oil-patch version of
Goldman Sachs. Goldman's stock sells at a price-earnings multiple of 17,
reflecting investors' well-founded distrust of trading earnings to be
reproduced reliably year after year. So why, the magazine asked, was Enron
awarded a multiple of 60-plus? Mmm...

Enron did yeoman service as a champion of deregulation. Boss Ken Lay, a
believer in technology and the power of markets, was a true visionary, to
the point of annoying people who didn't care for his air of being a man on
the right side of history. The moldering pipeline he took over would
certainly have been an also-ran if he had not thrown Enron headlong into
trading and marketing.

But deregulation doesn't confer permanent advantage on anybody. A
deregulated environment favors constant innovation and a continual upsetting
of plans and strategies.

Add the fact that, despite the California bubble, there is no reason to
believe energy prices won't continue their long-term relative decline as
technology advances more quickly than the depletion of conventional
resources. Add also the likelihood that information technology will continue
to lower the barriers to entry to Enron's trading business, which means more
competition and shrinking margins. Enron begins to look a lot like Phibro.

The great commodity-trading machine was already running down by 1981, when
it bought Salomon and Wall Street was swooning. Inflation was being quelled
by Paul Volcker. The products that Phibro traders bought and sold were
increasingly being traded transparently on electronic exchanges. "Four or
five years ago, they used to be able to take other companies to the
cleaners, because they knew where the market was and others didn't," a
trader explained. "With everyone knowing, within a few cents, where the
price of any product was, Phibro's ability to make a profit off its superior
knowledge disappeared."

Not only is this true of Enron, but of its would-be bottom fisher, Dynegy,
run by Mr. Lay's Houston homeboy, Chuck Watson. Dynegy's proposed takeover
of its former nemesis was hanging by a negotiation yesterday.

While Enron in recent years was selling hard assets and concentrating on
electronic market-making, Mr. Watson was doing the opposite. His big play in
the Enron deal is to get his hands on the original HNG-InterNorth pipeline,
now known as Northern Natural Gas. By having both feet planted in the real
business, he claims his firm will be able to make a profitable sideline out
of trading despite growing competition and transparency.

We'll see. Dynegy and Enron were born at the same time, and of the same
motive. Dynegy was originally created by six pipeline companies, a
Washington law firm and Morgan Stanley to take advantage of new
opportunities in deregulated natural gas. But the gnats are already
circling.

Gas producers who have claimed for years that the duo control too much of
their fate now insist they shouldn't be allowed to merge. Don't listen to
the fussbudgets. If this was a business in need of trustbusting, Enron
wouldn't have been resorting to funny accounting to make its earnings. As
Merrill Lynch's Donato Eassey has pointed out, wholesale margins have been
steadily thinning as trading becomes more transparent and competitive.

Wishful accounting has time and again proved the last refuge of companies
whose dearly held "visions" were not panning out. Enron prided itself on
being realistic and adaptive, but it failed to see that its own beliefs
about the world needed overhauling.

Ken, Enron Corp was a great empire that found itself vulnerable -- the same as the World Trade Center -- the same as our country's security.  The cost of exposure has been high but a cheap price to pay in the long run for our future generations.  I see Enron in the future.

I have known many great men personally, including Dr. Thomas D. Cronin, the inventor of breast implants (originally invented for breast reconstruction), and William Oldenburg, owner of the LA Express USFL football team, a self-made billionaire, who made and lost  and remade his billions three times.  Although I have yet to have the pleasure of personally knowing you, I have come to know your character.  I believe you will go down in history as one of the great leaders of our times.

Ken, I am a writer and would deeply appreciate if you would authorize me to write your biography (if not all, perhaps through this transition).  I promise that this biography will receive the same standard of excellence you expect from all your employees.  

Please let me know as soon as possible.  There is a lot of work to be done.

Sincerely yours,
Hattie Carrington

  <content name="title" action="cluster">Conflict of Interest</content>
  <content type="text" name="message">
Dear Mr. Lay,

Thank you for your email message. I imagine you are quite disenchanted with
India-specific issues, and in light of your staggering responsibilities, may
choose to spend little time on this email. I have enormous respect for you
as a leader. As such, I write to appeal to your finer sensibilities, and to
point out simple errors in the way the matter was probably explained to you,
and that which is evident in the email below. This explanation is important
to me for two reasons: (i) The size of the outstanding bonus is material to
me (ii) I do not wish for Enron to consider that there were any conflict of
interest issues during the course of my employment.

Conflict of Interest:
1. I had informed the entire senior management team of Enron India of the
investments I wanted to make in the internet companies, and of Global
Telesystems' role therein. I informed my CEO Sanjay Bhatnagar, my COO Wade
Cline, and my General Counsel Sandeep Katwala prior to my investments. From
time to time, my internet investment was joked about, talked about, and
discussed informally and openly  in senior management meetings, e.g. the PRC
meetings, strategy reviews etc. Furthermore, at the time I was starting the
companies, I had even sought the assistance of the GC in identifying outside
lawyers who could assist me in establishing complex cross-border legal
structures. I believe the three gentlemen I have mentioned will confirm this
point.

2. When Enron India's Broadband venture was merged with EBS Houston, the new
Houston based management did not know about my investment. This was quite
understandable, since there was little or no interaction between the two
groups prior to the merger. They asked for a full explanation, and I did so
through the process established by Kevin Hannon and Ken Rice: an inquiry by
Rob Walls. Furthermore, I offered to Rob Walls that if they felt there were
any perceived conflicts of interest, I would be willing to clear them in any
way as suggested by Houston. This would even include selling my investments
at a loss. My commitment to Enron was paramount.


At all times I maintained complete transparency on my investments. I
informed about them to everyone, from my administrative assistant to my CEO.
At the discretion of the management (Sanjay Bhatnagar was my manager for
2000, the year for which the bonus was to be paid), the amount decided was $
85,000. But when Sanjay Bhatnagar decided to leave Enron in early January
2001, Kevin Hannon terminated my employment on January 24. 2001. The
decision to not pay the bonus was made in retrospect by people who were not
my managers for the year in question, and was little else but punitive.
Indeed, Ken Rice and Rob Walls admitted in subsequent conversations to
Sanjay Bhatnagar that  there was no conflict of interest, but some action
had to be appear to be taken.

I sincerely hope the unpleasantness surrounding the Indian government's
dealings with Enron, as well as incomplete information that may have been
submitted to you by Kevin Hannon will not prejudice your decision in this
matter. May I request that the issue of the Bonus be reconsidered.

With warm regards and best wishes for your new role,

Annat Jain

Dear Mr. Jain:

Thank you for your email messages.  Prior to your termination, this
matter was reviewed by several members of Enron's Senior management
team, including Jeff Skilling and Kevin Hannon, two members of Enron's
Corporate Policy Committee.  I learned that although you were employed
at Enron India throughout calendar year 2000, there were significant
conflict of interest issues surrounding your involvement, while an Enron
employee, with two Internet companies and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Global Telecom.  As a result, Senior management determined that it would
be in the best interests of all parties to terminate the employment
relationship.

Upon your termination of employment, you were entitled to severance
under the Enron Corp. Severance Pay Plan.  However, the payment of
bonuses to employees is at the discretion of management and your
management team in place at the time of your termination determined, in
its discretion, not to pay a bonus to you.

During the course of your employment with Enron, your contributions were
recognized.  I wish you well in your future endeavors.

Very truly yours,


Kenneth L. Lay"

Dear Mr. Lay, 

My employment with Enron is to be terminated, the reason given by HR, for not meeting performance standards.  However, I firmly believe that this is not the real reason, the real one being for defying the wishes of my manager (Mr. Lowell Bezanis,Manager, EGM) who, I believe was acting in a discriminatory way towards me.  I have since filed a written complaint to Enron's EEO Committee. 

This committee, having investigated the case, has acknowledged that there were working environment issues but has refused to provide me with a written report of their findings.  As a consequence, my reasonable request for a re-deployment package has been rejected.   

If my employment is to be prematurely terminated I not only lose my job, but also my residence status in the US where I have lived in the past 8 years.  The HR department is fully aware of my situation and I feel that they were taking advantage of this fact when they asked me to sign a waiver not to sue Enron in exchange for protecting my status for 30 days.  I now feel that I am being pushed into a corner, unnecessarily, since all I have set out to achieve is to bring an awareness of the working conditions and the discrimination which is rife (not only towards myself but also to other employees, some of whom have left as a result) in the department and to move forward with practicable solutions. 

I have enjoyed a number of years as an employee of Enron where I have performed to the best of my ability, often receiving compliments from clients.  This cannot be the only way to solve this issue! 

The Trigger and Retaliation.    

Since Mr. Bezanis has been my line manager, internal training opportunities have repeatedly been denied to me.  On August 28, I attended a class of 'natural gas structuring'. Mr. Bezanis called the Learning Center refusing to pay the associated costs, however, I was welcomed to remain in the class at no charge. 

I felt that this situation could not continue and so I made an appointment with Ms. Shanna Funkhouser (my HR representative).  The day previous to the aforementioned meeting I was summoned to appear before Ms.Funkhouser.  Mr. Bezanis and Mr. Jeff Andrews were present in the conference room as I entered.  Feeling intimidated, I requested that I meet with Ms. Funkhouser privately the next day in order to submit a formal complaint regarding the EEO, as agreed previously.  She refused and continued with what I can only describe as adisciplinary by accusing me of excessive use of Enron property and equipment.  I was suspended and sent home with pay with possible termination. Ms. Funkhouser explained that her actions were based on the following: 

-        the assumption that I was making long distance personal calls from work 
-        that I was making jobapplications by company email 

Unequal Employment Opportunities and Unfair Treatment. 

As a manager, Mr. Bezanis has: 

-        Intentionally and consistently limited my employment opportunities in terms of training and performance appraisals.  He has repeatedly disapproved of my training courses without good cause since he refuses to explain his disapproval. 

-        Shown unfavorable bias towards my job performance (PRC process) which according to the PRC rules should be judged also by my peers' and clients' by review.  Until now, Iam still have not been informed of my PRC results. 

-        Made efforts to suppress my innovative ideas such as that of creating an 'energy index' as a potential useful trading instrument.  My idea was warmly welcomed by the team in the Department Offsite, but the reaction of Mr. Bezanis was of anger for not going through him first.  I was banned by him from developing the idea further. 

Discrimination. 

It is our belief that Mr. Bezanis has difficulty dealing with women employees, especially competent women, as equals.  His rough, stifling, and unfair management style has led to the resignation of Ms. Courtney Campbell, the other only woman reporting to him.   





Hostile Working Environment. 

The working environment under Mr. Bezanis has been an intimidating and abusive one. Derogatory language offensive to women is frequent and common. Very little respect is paid to our integrity and intelligence.  We are managed by "threats" rather than constructive comments.   

Wrongful Termination. 

Knowing I was unfairly treated, Enron HR has not helped address my concerns.  I was told that my employment is to be terminated due to my lowest ranking in the mid-year PRC process.  Ms. Cindy Olson admitted that the PRC practices might be unfair, but she said she had no power to re-open the past PRC cases.  I feel I have been subjected to a victimization campaign while the whole Enron organization attempts to protect the managers, no matter how wrong they are.  I request your attention and help during my most difficult time. 

I thank you for your understanding and commitment to a happy and positive resolution in this case. 

Yours sincerely, 


Mingcheng Lian

Rosalee,

On the Business Council web site the log-on for all members is BC01 (note
this is the numeral '0' NOT the letter 'o').  If you have any problems just
give this office a call at 202/298-785-0296.  Either Cindy Cassidy or I will
be glad to help.

Thanks,
Cathy Cox

  <content type="text" name="message">Mr. Lay:

For most of Enron employees, November 9th will go down as one of the most tragic days of our lives. We are not ready to give up on Enron and have its name disappear from the world. On a personal level, I can handle the financial loss as I invested everything(including my 401k) into Enron because I believed in it. I will now be working till I die which I do not mind. What I mind the most is to have Enron's name diappear.  Please tell us if there is anything we can do to keep our baby alive. I am willing to sacrifice whatever I have for this.

Subject:	May God Bless you and your family- We are with you

Mr. Lay:

In view of the events of past weeks surrounding Enron's stock, I am taking the liberty of writing this note to you. I will try to keep this brief. First of all, I want to say that  you are doing a terrific job. With your leadership we will turn this around soon. May God bless you and your family so you can continue leading this great company out of this crisis. I have been with the company for almost 21 years. I remember the difficult days that we have been through during this time . Particularly I remember like yesterday when I used to be in Omaha and you came there and, talked to all of us and gave us hope and your commitment to turn things around in those uncertain and difficult days after the merger and promised to make this a great company. We all rallied behind you and we turned this company into one of the greatest company in the world. We are with you now, and with your leadership we will turn this around again. For most of us, Enron is not just a place to work. It is part of us.  It is our family. It is our life. In the current situation the pain we feel is the same as if one of our loved one was seriously sick and we did not know what to do except to follow the advise of the doctor. We will follow your advise and give you our 200% . On a personal level for me this a very emotional and painful time. I have grown with this company that has given me great opportunities.  Currently I am working in Bolivia as president of Gas TransBoliviano and feel perhaps there is something I should be doing to help in this situation. Mr. Lay, If there is anything I can do above and beyond my current job, please let me know. You have my commitment and I will not disappoint you. Please consider me like one of those guys in NY showing up with shovels to help after the WTC disaster. I am hoping that I will be called upon. Again, may God bless you and your family. Look forward to seeing you in San Antonio.

With Kind Regards,

Nasim Khan

Forgive the string of emails, but I thought a more expedient way to confirm
Mr. Lay's current reported holdings would be to lay them out in a

I thought Ken was well received. His speech appeared to most balanced.  He
acknowledged the need to accomodate climate change concerns while meeting
energy and power needs.  He delivered the speech in a measured accessbile
tone.

Well done.

Subject: Take it to them
Last night, I opened up my Bible and found myself reading about  King
Hezekiah.  The bullet points are these:
1.  Hezekiah was  the most Godly man,
5 He trusted in Jehovah, the God of Israel; so that after  him was none like
him among all the kings of Judah, nor among them that were  before him.
  2 Kings 18:5 (ASV)
2.  The Assyrians surrounded  his city with a great army.
3.  He went to God with great faith and  honored God.
4.  God sent an angel
35 And it came to pass that night,  that the angel of Jehovah went forth, and
smote in the camp of the Assyrians  a hundred fourscore and five thousand:
and when men arose early in the  morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.
  2 Kings 19:35  (ASV)
I don't know if he intervenes like this in corporate affairs, but  if we seek
His guidance, how can we lose.  Take care of  yourselves.
Love,
Mark

Mr. Lay, thank you for taking quick action.  I was out of the office yesterday, but when I heard your broadcast message, I definately felt pride in the action, increased confidence and an increased committment to help in any way I can, as Enron works to get this behind us.

Subject:	Jeff McMahon Named CFO


Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.</content>

Dear Mr. Lay,

For what it is worth, I believe this move, although very unfortunate given Andy's long service to Enron, is the right thing to do. In the way that Enron has historically been the poster child for corporate innovation, I hope you will now lead us in the direction that makes us the poster child for handling a crisis of investor confidence. Enron is such an amazing company, I trust you will do everything necessary to work cooperatively with the investor community to restore the company to its former greatness.

Respectfully yours,

  <content type="text" name="message">As we have discussed at the Board level as well as in Management Commitee, the default swap market is extremely illiquid.  While it is true that ENE is one of the most liquid names in the market, the entire market would move based on an order of $40 to $50 MM.  We have heard that there have been standing sell orders in the market totalling approximately $150 MM which have yet to be absorbed, it could be that the prices moved significantly in order for those sellers to find a buyer.

While this market is an important datapoint in evaluating the credit markets view of our name, it is not the sole determinant.  It is important to note that secondary trading levels of our bonds (a far more liquid market and accurate indicator of our ability to raise incremental capital) have only widened 5 - 10 basis points over the course of the day. 

While I would very much like to tighten the spreads in the default swap market, I think that we need to keep those price markers  in perspective.  Having said that, anything we can do to support the credit and tighten those prices ultimately helps in our ability to raise debt in all markets.

Subject:	 reaction from the credit markets on the earnings call

John thought you might be interested in the following from the credit markets....

Play by play during the call on the 5yr Enron Credit Default Swaps from Morgan Stanley:

1.  5Y BIDS GETTING HIT ON OPENING AS EARNINGS NEWS LOOKED LIKE
    CLEANING HOUSE.  250.
2.  DURING THE CONFERENCE CALL; WHICH APPARENTLY WAS UNCLEAR,
    TICKED OUT 255,260,265.
3.  LAY INDICATED NEAR END OF CONFERENCE "NO RATINGS ACTION
    ANTICIPATED".   MINUTE CONFERENCE ENDED MOODY'S WATCH NEWS
    RELEASED.  280 BID.
4.  LAY ALSO MENTIONED 3Q NEG CASH FLOW DUE TO SOME CONTRACT
    ROLLOFF.  UNCLEAR MESSSAGE.
5.  ENE SAYS COMMITTED TO "INV GRADE" RATHER THAN "A"  280/325


Summary from Morgan Stanley after the call:

CREDIT DERIVATIVE UPDATE:  ENRON CORP

AFTER THE NEWS THIS AM ($1 BIL. CHARGE), THE COMPANY HOSTED A
CALL AT 10AM NY TIME.   THE CALL DID NOT GO WELL &amp; ENRON SPREADS
ARE HEADING WIDER IN CREDIT DERIVATIVE LAND.  MKTS ARE SPOOKED
B/C:  1) MOODY'S WATCHLISTED CO NEGATIVE, 2) ENE STATED "THEY
ARE COMMITED TO INVESTMENT GRADE RATING," WHICH IS A CHANGE FROM
THE SINGLE-A BOGEY THEY ONCE EXTOLED, 3) CO. DID NOT ADDRESS ALL
LIQUIDITY CONCERNS, AND 4) MORE CHARGES COMING?
5YR MARKETS:

      ENE (PRE-WTC):   165/185        ENE (8AM TODAY): 240/260
      ENE (WEEK AGO):  250/300      **ENE NOW:         275/350

Clearly the above are a function of what people think they heard...I did not alter any of the email.  In general MSDW likes Enron credit but this is how they see the market.  Enron is one of the most actively traded names in the credit derivative market.  Let me know if you want updates as the market gets more clarity and works throught the details</content>

Dear Dr.  Lay,

	The attached email was sent to you regarding Vince Kaminski's request that I assist Howard University in the development of the ISE.

	Is this still  a priority of yours?

	If so, please let me know what is the next step.

Thank you kindly,

Dear Dr. Lay,

	My name is Iris Mack.  My former boss - Vince Kaminski  - asked me to become involved with Howard University's development of its new Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Center (ISE).

	I recently moved from the Houston Research group to the Power Options trading desk - as indicated in the forwarded email.

	My new boss - Harry Arora - is very agreeable to my being a part of the Enron team to assist Howard in the development of the ISE.

	Looking forward to working with you and the ofther members of Howard's Board of Trustees on such an exciting project.

Kind regards,
Iris Mack

Dear All,

	As many of you may already know, I will be moving to the Power Trading group.  My new position will allow me to combine my experience in derivatives, as well as my knowledge of the power industry.  

?	My derivatives experience:  Recently, I worked on Credit Derivatives pricing models for Enron Credit.  In addition, I worked as a derivatives structurer at Investment Banque BNP Paribas in London, where I also obtained my licenses in Securities, Regulations and Derivatives.  In addition, I spent my summers in Associateships and consulting positions in derivatives pricing at Salomon Brothers and Charles Schwab. Finally, I conducted real options academic research at MIT.

?	My power experience:  My Harvard PhD thesis in Applied Mathematics had applications to the "transient stability analysis of electrical power systems."  In addition, my London Business School MBA thesis was entitled "Day-Ahead Lunch-Time Electricity Demand Forecasting:  Applications to Electricity and Weather Derivatives".  


I really enjoyed my time working in the Research Group, as well as my time supporting Enron Credit.  

Looking forward to working with you in the future!


Kind regards,
Iris

Marilou, we probably have already responded, but Ken will not be

as he will be doing analyst meetings out of the city this week.

Mr. Lay,

I am writing to you this afternoon because I am concerned for the safety of me and my coworkers here at Enron.  In light of the recent events that have happened I am worried that security here at Enron is still lacking.  I only say this because just this morning I forgot my Enron badge, so I had to get a guest pass, this of course is not a big deal and happens all the time.  However, I had my backpack with me like usual and nobody seemed to even raise an eyebrow.  Now obviously I pose zero threat to Enron but I feel like somebody who walks in with a guest pass needs only a drivers license, which hasn't been a problem for most terrorists to acquire, of somebody who works here at Enron.  Can you see where I am going with this?  

Anyway, I'm a first year analyst and this whole event makes me more and more nervous as time progresses and the events unfold.  I only come to you with this concern because I am not the only one of my friends who have mentioned it.  Please take this into consideration and know that I only raise this issue for the safety of everybody.

Sincerely,

Aaron Berutti

  <content type="text" name="message">Dear Dr. Lay,

On  Friday, September 8, 2000, I was on a business trip in Findlay, Ohio meeting with Marathon Ashland Petroleum Company Inc. We had recently signed a  five year  electric deal in Houston covering their  Illinois pipeline and terminal facilities behind four utlities. I was there at their request to review other opportunities in Illinois and Ohio and present them with small gifts over a celebration dinner with their spouses. On Saturday, September 9, 2000 at approximately 5:30 am I was struck in my car by an eighteen wheeler passing traffic in a no passing zone.
Your kindness in providing my wife and I with your personal jet so that I could transfer from the Toledo trauma facility I was in, to a local hospital in our home state of New Jersey was greatly appreciated. I needed to be with my daughters and family and be fully evaluated for the multiple traumas I suffered. Getting home meant everything to us at the time, and there were no good alternatives before your generous gesture.
Since last year I have had three surgeries and am preparing for cervical spine surgery October 23, 2001, followed by knee surgery and ankle surgery. It has been an immensely stressful time for all of us, but we always come back to your help at our time of need. In addition, Dr. Lay, I cannot say enough about the kindness and care of Mark Harada, my supervisor and friend, who was at my side after the accident and who has been an endless source of support through our difficult times.
Mark Harada has been recognized by Enron for the exceptional individual he is. His potential value to Enron is immeasurable. He is truly the embodiment of what an Enron manager should be. I was saddened to hear his leadership role in EES had been diminished. He is exceptional.
Based on the  surgeries that lay ahead of me, with the accompanying rehabilitation periods, it appears that I will not be returning to EES for several months. That is why I'm writing to you now. This was a long overdue note of thanks.
Lastly, in a conversation with John Boosey, (formerly Enserch), before his death, he asked if I spoke with you, to pass on his regards. John was a mentor to me during my years with Enserch/Ebasco and had been in ill health for some time.
Finally, from my wife, Dr. Gail Holian Pestana and I, thank you again for bringing us home.

Our Best Regards,

Joe and Gail</content>

Sir,
I read your note with great deal of interest and care.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that this email was devoid of any stereotypical remarks that are so prevalent in the mass media today.

Unfortunately, such is not the case with other communications being sent out on behalf of Enron Corp.  A case in point is the corporate security email, titled 'Travel Security Update', that was send out yesterday.  In this email, reaction to possible U.S. military retaliation has been tied to extremist Islamic violence.  Truth of the matter is that any reaction to the U.S. military action could be because of extreme nationalism, most likely to the be the case, or even extreme regionalism.  References to Islam, extremism, and violence, in the manner used in the security communication only perpetuates the stereotypes.

I would like for you and my co-workers at Enron to know that MUSLIMS DO NOT HATE AMERICANS (regardless of what Frank Graham wants to believe).  Muslims do have deep-rooted disagreements and distrusts of the American foreign policy but that in no way translates to what the mass media  would have us believe.

thanks

As you know, the U.S. government is investigating hundreds, if not thousands, of relatives, acquaintances and associates of the individuals who may have been involved in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.  We believe that the media will soon be reporting that one of the many individuals being questioned is an Enron employee in Houston.  It is appropriate for us to withhold judgment and to continue to cooperate fully with federal authorities.  Because this is a matter in the hands of the federal authorities, we cannot provide additional information at this time.   However, we will keep you informed, to the greatest extent possible. 

Please keep in mind that thousands of people who may or may not have any information about the terrorist attacks are being questioned as part of this investigation.  We continue to have every reason to believe that our employees and facilities are safe.  If you have concerns, please call Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804.  If you receive any media or external inquiries about this matter, please call Public Relations at (713) 853-5670.

At Enron, diversity is one of our strengths, and we respect and embrace all people of all faiths and beliefs.  Please continue to keep our employees who have been impacted by this tragedy in your thoughts and prayers.  </content>

  <content type="text" name="message">Dear Joannie,

The ornament is fantastic and very appropriate this year.  We will need to
get an exact head count for the Enron order.  The corporate secretary
usually gives me an exact directors list and then Ken is the one that
decides which of his executives are invited to the dinner and Rosie provides
me with a list.

Additionally, I would like 15 ornaments for my personal use that I would
like to get ordered ASAP.  Is your source giving you a discount and if so,
how much?  I have several sources for getting discounts on most items,
including Radko ornaments, that I use every year.  Let's compare prices.
Thank you.  Linda

I had a vendor send this to me.  It is a special Radko ornament he
designed in remembrance of the recent disasters in NY and Washington.
The proceeds from the sell of this are going to the relief efforts.  I
thought it might be of interest to you as a possible holiday gift.  The
cost is around $30.  The problem is, we would need to reserve some by
this Friday.  I'm happy to coordinate one consolidated order if this is
of interest.  Please get back to me ASAP and let me know.  Thanks.

  <content type="text" name="message">Senator Gramm,

I expect you have already considered these:
1.  Rebate surpluses out of the Airline trust fund that is a collection of
taxes on airline tickets.  This in addition to stopping the taxes would
provide needed liquidity to the airlines.

2.  Accelerate depreciation, perhaps to two or three years, on all capital
goods purchased before March 31, 2001.  This would provide a very strong
incentive for capital investment immediately.

3.  Defer all corporate taxes due for the next six months and make them
payable, with interest equal to AFR, over the next two years.  This would
effectively put the government in the position of lending to corporations at
the federal government's borrowing rate.  The net effect over two years is
neutral, except for potential defaults, but the fiscal impact is
significant.

Good Luck, we need more public officials of your ilk up there.  Sorry that
you won't be there much longer.

Regards,
Mark

  <content type="text" name="message">Mr. Lay, 

For the past 13 days, I have been on a medical mission trip to Honduras (five of which weren't
scheduled, but were necessary because Continental canceled flights in light of our nation's
tragedy).

Although Honduras is a third world country and very little American news makes it there, I was
told that Enron had donated 1 million dollars to the Red Cross and was matching employee donations 
2 to 1 in response to the terrorist attacks on our Country. Mr. Lay, it made me even more proud 
to work for this company, and to work for you.

I can't tell you what an honor it is to work for this company and for you (you hear countless stories
of what you and Enron have done for our community).

Sincerely,

Josh Duncan

  <content type="text" name="message">
Mr. Lay, 
On the 28th, the Lord impressed upon me to begin praying over Enron at Enron. My daily prayers started on that first email but I began yesterday to do what people call "prayer walking" and will continue for 16 days. It is based on something I read in 2 Chronicles 29:17 about Hezekiah cleansing the temple. It took a total of 16 days. 
The Lord impressed me to read Psalms 119 yesterday and Mr. Lay, the Lord did NOT condemn you in my heart. It was as if He was telling me of His heart towards you. You know how the Bible tells us that the Holy Spirit will convict us of righteousness too. It was like that. You and I know it is His righteousness but isn't it wonderful that God's heart for you is not accusing. That is the enemy. God does not send the people that are holding up signs and railing accusations. He sends people like me. People that He has given a burden for your needs.
When He first impressed me to do this, I wanted Him to give me scripture that would back this up. I have been taught that you always have to compare what you are thinking back to God's Word. Well, He gave me 1 scripture the first day. 
Galations 6:2  "Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ." 
Then this morning He gave me this one. Now it may not make much sense to you but it is one that the Lord had given me as a personal word for me. It is Isaiah 58 12. The part about "...you will be called Repairer of Broken Walls..."  I know He means that for me to KNOW that He has sent me.
You are my brother in Christ. God has called me to encourage you in this time. God is madly in love with you and wants you to call upon Him NO MATTER what you are feeling. 
I was listening to Tony Evans this morning on a tape and he was talking about who God is. He talked about how God is infinitely powerful, infinitely kind, infinitely everything that is Him..... For God to save you, your company, your employees, is NOT hard for God. With God all things are possible. Read Matthew 17:20, Matthew 19:26, Mark 10:27, and Luke 1:37. 
Let's believe God because He is able and He wants to save. He always wants to save. Even when he humbles us, he only does it so that we will call out to Him and remember that HE ALONE IS GOD. He has made us for HIMSELF. For HIS glory. 
God and God alone has sent me to pray for his mighty hand to deliver. That is what He is constantly confirming to me in scripture. I don't know what it will look like but it will BE GOD and YOU WILL KNOW it. He is not saving for your name but for HIS. 
Mr. Lay, Jeremiah 18:1-12 is something you might need to read. If I really love you as a brother in Christ, I want to remind you that we can NOT be afraid of the hand of the Lord. It is always for our good. You as a man of God know this and I hope you are encouraged that there is ALWAYS HOPE in JESUS. NO MATTER WHAT. This is such an encouraging passage because it tells us that ALL we have to do is turn to God and call on Him. 
I know you must be very weary. I am praying for the employees to supernaturally be productive. For the Lord to knit their hearts together and to minister forgiveness. Not to accuse. 
I haven't read any news yet. Remember I don't have TV or read the newspaper. I am sending this to you without being afraid of what I will read on the internet. 
Great is His faithfulness...... 
Lynda Phinney 
The Joy of the Lord is my strength...

I just wanted to give you a positive note on my behalf.  I really don't know if you will read this, but if you do I wish you all the best with Enron.  I don't know if I'm one of those employees who will be laid off, but on the good side of things:  I respect you profoundly.  I know that you are looking for your employees best interest.  I just wanted to say that I'm proud to be an Enron employee and no matter what I will always be proud to have worked under you.  Again I wish the company the best and I hope that one day Enron can be on the top like we were.  I also wanted to say that I will always be happy to come back and join our wonderful team.  I haven't work here very long, but I liked what Enron did for their people and I respect Enron entirely.  I know that Enron will rise again one day and I hope to be able to join our great family again.  I just wanted to make sure that you knew that someone out their is proud of what you are doing and respects your efforts.  I hope that you are positive and standing proud of your success with the company.  I will always be proud.  Thank you for all your help and efforts.  I appreciate everything...  Take care Mr. Lay and May God always guide you through these hard times.  I know that you will make the right decision for Enron.  Again I just want to send you a positive note, instead of all those negative emails that you have been receiving.  I just wanted to make sure that you knew that someone still believes in what you created.
 
Thank you,
Virginia Cavazos

I just got to the office and wanted to send this on. The Lord gave me some good stuff to read over ya'll this morning. Some was hard to "hear" but as is His way, there is ALWAYS His good heart in His messages. ALWAYS a "Come to me, I love you." message. 
I need to time to pray over that email but this is still true even after the passages. I hope you are encouraged. Hope you got the tapes I left on Saturday.
I am keeping a "prayer journal" which is a little separate from the "prayer walking" but I am getting to where I record the impressions during my walks. 
OH MR. LAY, I just know that you are calling on Jesus for wisdom! Your heart must be so heavy. Call out for His people too. A shepherd cares for his sheep. God is going to take many of "His sheep" that have been under your care into another "earthly pasture" for their care but He is working all things together for good-to them that love Him. Let's pray for more to fall in love with Jesus!

Mr. Lay, 
I am back home and about ready to leave for church. It occurred to me while I was driving back home that God knew of this time before the foundations of the world. He knew that you would be the man at the head of this company. You are a man of God and the Lord knew you would turn to Him in time of trouble. 
Think about that. God gave you a shepherd's heart because your employees "heard" your voice in the emails you sent during the hard times leading up to this. Your's is a gentle voice. THAT is GOD in you! And a shepherd at that! Oh how blessed you are!
You showed that you don't love money because you did not take the "golden parachute" money. Even though you might have hated to give it up "in your feelings" but in your heart you obeyed a higher call on your life! 
God is apparently keeping you calm even during the railing accusations that the enemy is hurling against you. Look at how you glorify God. You most likely don't feel that way but that is what the truth is. 
God has me in constant prayer on your behalf, your employees, your wife, and the spouses of the employees, for HIS glory! </content>

"It is the spirit which can bear things, not simply with resignation, but
with blazing hope; it is not the spirit which sits statically enduring in
the one place, but the spirit which bears things because it knows that these
things are leading to a goal of glory; it is not the patience which grimly
waits for the end, but the patience which radiantly hopes for the dawn.  It
has been called "masculine constancy under trial."  It has been said that
always it has a background witch is courage... It is the quality which keeps
a man on his feet with his face to the wind.  It is the virtue which can
transmute the hardest trial into glory because beyond the pain it sees the
goal."  William Barclay

I have asked both Ben Smith and Dan Leff to confirm
that these expenses will be paid so I can close the
office in Nevada.  It is a small amount but I can not
cover the cost for Enron out of my personal funds.
The total outstanding is $3,443.04.  Can you please
see that this gets paid ASAP.
Thanks and God Bless,
Chuck Allured

Ben, Leticia,
I hope this is not the last time we get to work
together.  As we discussed, I will have some office
closure expenses that I will need to get reimbursed
for.  I have been locked out of the server so I can
not enter them into the xms system.
This amounts to the following:

ATT wireless:
$212.71 November Billing
$90 Termination charge

Nevada Bell:
$170 November billing (est.)
$500 DSL Setup fee (November)
$49.95 November DSL monthly fee
$250 Termination Charge of one year contract

--------
$1,272.66 Total

Can you please process this and get $ to me asap so I
can disconnect all of the services?  You can reach me
at (775)832-2141 or cra123@yahoo.com

Thanks for all of the memories and may God bless us
all.
Chuck

12/6/01: Lord, how excellent is Your name in all the earth! You are so incredibly good to Mr. Lay!! Look at what you gave us today!!! Colossians and 1 Thessalonians. What an encourager You are Lord!! Who can know You!!!??? Your ways are certainly NOT our ways! Thank you, Jesus!!!
Ok, Lord, this is what is in my heart today for them. 
Lord, just like you gave Noah a rainbow (from the throne room of God, by the way!)-I am asking You to give them an assurance that this kind of disciplining will not happen again. Yes, Lord, they need to trust in You. I know that but every time the stock goes down they will panic. So, I guess first of all, they need grace to put their trust in YOU but remembering that we are dumb sheep, please do something in their hearts to not go into panic every time the stock goes nuts. I guess what I am asking is for You to supernaturally restore confidence in the leadership of Enron. Give them supernatural favor in the hearts of the people. BUT You must also command Your Word in the hearts of the leadership. Let them NEVER get into this kind of mess again. 
You tell us to look well to the state of our flocks (Prov 27:23 Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds.)
Thank you, Lord, that YOU bear such wonderful witness of your child, Ken Lay. Make him see that Your heart is so good towards him. Make him see, Lord. We need to know that our Father is on our side. We come into agreement with you that YOU ALONE are GOD. AND we ask your forgiveness for our being seduced by "foreign gods" (things of this world since we are children of the KINGDOM OF GOD) and THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR GRACE!!!!!!!!!
We love you, Jesus. We love you so. Thank you that you delight in us! How can this be? You say so in Your Word. For the first time, I really do want to get there soon! Why would I hang onto the things of this world when I can experience Your Love FOREVER! You will make us blush with Your gaze of love upon us. Oh God, give us MORE of the Holy Spirit that we may bear MUCH FRUIT!!!
Back to requests, Lord, give Mr. Lay (and those he delegates authority to) supernatural discernment so that they may "hear the abundance of rain"!!! I LOVE THAT VERSE, LORD!!! 
Thank you that you are more powerful and that we DO NOT need to FEAR ANYTHING! If God is for us, who can be against us!!! AMEN and AMEN!!
Oh, by the way, Lord. Thank you for showing how You are gathering your "scattered sheep" you showed us yesterday! Enron field!!! Thank you, Lord. Lord, don't let that name die-ok? It is good. Restore it! Rebuild on the wastes like you talk about in Isaiah!
Still another thing. Thank you that you truly are about GRACE. Give us supernatural understanding of that. In Jesus name, our mighty warrior! Prince of Peace, Lord of Lords!

Mr. Lay, 
The scripture today was from Psalms 7 through Psalms 10. I am so overwhelmed with what God is showing me. I so hope you are being ministered to. 
I just heard from a friend that you are apparently going to have to appear in court. I don't know if this is true but the message is still the same. God loves you. I know that you, maybe above all the rest, KNOW that. Minister to the others that know Him. Pray for them, with them. They need to know the One that we know.
I am glad I heard so that I may pray for you specifically. 
12/7/01: Lord, all through this You have shown me over and over your holiness but most of all, more than all, Your grace. You lead me to confess this morning that I have not trusted the hand of God because I didn't really trust the heart of God. In all of this, You have shown me Your heart. By showing me Your heart for one of Your children in trouble, grave trouble, You have made me know You. How could I deny a Father that has such kindness towards His children? One that does NOT accuse us but says "Come to me, I will give you rest. I will save you. It gives me pleasure to give you the Kingdom." 
Lord, Mr. Lay, probably already knows all of this and maybe this has all been for me. All I know is that more than ever, I come before You on behalf of my brother, Ken. You, above all others, know every thought, every fear, every doubt, every arrow from the enemy that has made its way through. Every verse that you have uttered into my heart has been about how you love him. How you delight in him. How you do not condemn him. How you see the righteous acts he has done. Maybe even from seeds sown in his life long ago - I don't know - but You have shown me certainly that this is the God I want to give my whole heart to. I don't want to hold anything back anymore, ever again. I am in love with you, Jesus. I thank you for the emphasis on the verse about how You will MAKE us love YOU with all our hearts, souls, minds, and strength. 
Do that for Mr. Lay, Lord. Do that for him. Pour out Your Spirit on him so that he can't help but completely give up to this God of his. This God that has never left him-will never leave him. This Father that says "I delight in you". This Bridegroom that says, "I promise to take care of all your needs. I want you with me for the rest of my life". This Son given to us as a baby. Laid at the feet of mankind as The Lamb offering that God required. Like You lead Abraham to prophesy so many years before "And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together" (Genesis 22:8). Lord, YOU ALONE ARE WORTHY OF OUR PRAISE. Thank you. In Jesus name.

I have very patiently explained the situation to Wayne Rogers and Craven Crowell on behalf of the former Vice President.  I will call them again tomorrow, hopefully with a little more positive news and the possibility of being able to see some information some time next week.  I am sorry that Dr. Lay has been bothered by this.

Take care,
Mark

Ken--

At the conclusion of our phone conversation, you indicated that I should get
back with you if we were having any difficulty in pursuing our interest in
acquiring the Enron wind business.  Knowing the many demands on your time, I
regret to have to come back to you.  However, despite repeated attempts, we
are still locked out of negotiations over the wind asset and have been
unable to receive information we've requested.  Our phone calls have been
returned, but information and/or a seat at the table have not been
forthcoming.

Can we discuss this again by pbone?  Alternatively, as I suggested in a note
to you on Monday, we stand ready at any moment to come visit you in person
about this if you might have even 15 minutes for us.

Again, apologies for coming back to you about this.  But, it would be
extremely helpful if you could assist us in being able to move forward on
our interest in bidding on this business.

Many thanks!
Katie McGinty

In my earlier note to you I was inquiring about the possiblitiy that the
wind asset would be auctioned.  I want to expandbe clear here and reiterate
our intentions:  while we believe that an open-ended auction would be
unnecessarily costly and inefficient for Enron and for potential bidders,
our overriding interest is in being able to bid on Enron wind, period.  I am

asking for information so that we could prepare a bid.  To date, we have not

Dear Dr. Lay,

We are looking forward to your participation at the upcoming "Markets
in Transition" symposium at Rice University on January 10, 2002.

Invitations to the event were sent approximately two weeks ago.  The
invitations listed the agenda and speakers.  We have completed
incorporating the biography and photograph that you provided into the
program brochure.

During the event, we have allocated 20 minutes, beginning at 1:40PM,
for your remarks on Markets in Transition.  We expect your remarks to
be broad in scope and to provide your views on how the economic and
market factors of recession, technology evolution, and heightened
security are impacting the business landscape.  Our hope is that your
remarks will be generic in nature -- Markets in Transition is a
concept that applies to virtually all industries.

We understand that you will make no reference to Enron.  Furthermore,
there will be no question and answer session after your presentation.
We will take measures to ensure that the press has no access to you
before or after your remarks.

Please return the speaker logistics form (requested separately) at
your earliest convenience.

We look forward to your participation.  Please contact me or Brad
Burke, Associate Director of the Rice Alliance (713-348-6136), if you
wish additional information.  Thank you.

Sincerely,

Steve Currall

  <content type="text" name="message">Gentlemen,

In keeping with our tradition, please come to tomorrow's breakfast meeting
prepared to write down some of your New Year's resolutions, seal them in an
envelope (which will be provided) so that they can be mailed to you
mid-year.  I suggest dividing resolutions into categories that are
spiritual, mental, physical and social.

Under "spiritual" examples of resolutions could be daily prayer time and
Bible reading or attending certain classes or reading certain books to gain
in Christian maturity.  You may even want to set a goal of mentoring a
younger Christian as they develop in the faith.

I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.


Best regards,

Jack

  <content type="text" name="message">
Mr. Lay, 
I just want you to know that I am praying for you constantly. Keep your eyes on Jesus and don't listen to what everyone is saying! He will say whatever He wants to say to you as you read the Word. He does not "point the finger" and accuse. In fact He doesn't even like that. (Isaiah 58:9  "Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am. If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity;") That word vanity in the Hebrew means trouble, wickedness, sorrow. I guess that verse means you can't do it either even when they hurt you with their words. God will defend you. 
You said something about being old fashioned that the truth will prevail. That is not old fashioned .... that is God. You have that in your heart because you have Jesus in your heart. Believe God! He says "if God is for us then who can be against us?" 
What a WONDERFUL Word of Testimony you will have when this is finished. Remember, He brings us out of ALL our afflictions! (Psalm 34:19  "Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all.")
I listened to a teaching one time about Rev 12:11 "And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death."  They said that the devil can't take the blood away from us and that he wants to destroy our testimony. Mr. Lay, you turned to Jesus in time of trouble. That is part of this Word of Testimony. You continually pray for guidance. That is part of this Word of Testimony. You trust in Him. That is part of this Word of Testimony. You trust that He will bring you through this. That is part of this Word of Testimony. You will tell the truth. That is part of this Word of Testimony. 
When all is said and done. God is going to show you and others (2 Chron 16:9  "For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him.")
I am telling you. That is what God showed me in the 16 Days readings. God testified of a perfect heart towards him. Yours. Not that you have done "perfectly"  but that you had a "perfect heart towards him". It is clearly shown in how you conduct yourself. 
I ran across these verses and thought you might like them to encourage you. 
2 Sam 22:33  God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect. 
1 Chron 29:12  Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.
Psalm 62:11  God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God. 
Isaiah 40:29  He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength. 
If your secretary could send me the dates you are to testify before Congress, it is on my heart to pray specifically for you while you testify.
Thank you, Jesus, for your Word. Thank you for your servant, Mr. Lay. Thank you that you ARE going to get him THROUGH all of this. In Jesus name.

  <content name="title" action="cluster">Goodbye Mr. Lay</content>
  <content type="text" name="message">Dear Mr. Lay:

You may not actually take time to read this email, but it will make me feel better having sent it.  I started with Enron 2 1/2 years ago in the ENA Volume Management Group.  Even after having 3 managers in the group, my reviews were outstanding, and after 1 1/2 years in the group, I decided to spread my wings.  I wanted to make a difference at Enron and I decided to take a position with Enron Global Markets, a growing and prosperous group at the time.  Once again, I was passed around through various managers, 3 to be exact, however I still received outstanding reviews.  With all of my reviews, always came the promise of being promoted with the next one.  However, with the last mid-year review, my boss knew that the time had come - but he encouraged me to wait until year-end, as my raise and bonus would be much better that way.  I knew that he was looking out for my best interest, as I am sure the other 5 managers had done along the way as well.  

Unfortunately, the company took a turn for the worse and I could soon see that my future with this company that I sincerely loved was coming to an end.  I was one of the lucky ones, as I was not severed.  I knew that since I was a ???survivor???, all the hard work had been recognized and that is why I was considered a ???critical employee???.  But the longer I stayed, the more the uncertainty of the company became abundantly apparent to me and I knew I needed to do something to protect my career and myself.  I decided to seek employment outside of Enron.  I was fortunate.  I found something immediately.  I honestly believe it was because of my experience at Enron, along with having some of the best mangers and directors as mentors, that I was able to find such an opportunity.  

I knew that the day would come that I would have to give notice, but I was hoping and praying that Enron Management would not do me wrong, as so many of my friends had been.  I knew that Enron would be fair and pay me my three weeks of vacation that I was due.  I was mistaken.  When it all came down to it, Enron in the end looked out for itself.  After receiving the run around, I was eventually told that I would not receive any of my vacation, although the rules had never been revised from previous years and nothing was ever clearly communicated from Human Resources.  

I worked my ass off for Enron for 2 ?? years, and this company does not even have the decency to pay me my vacation.  I do know that my managers and directors received 90 day retention packages, that amounted to more that my annual compensation.  I know that some people within my own Enron Company were severed once it was determined that they had a job safely outside of Enron ??" that way they were assured $4,500.  I also know that when notice was given for some employees, they were immediately severed, so that their benefits would not roll into the next month.  Again, they received their $4,500 and had a job lined up to immediately go to.  What are the rules?  How should these situations have been handled?  Should not each employee be treated fairly?  

Time and time again, I stood behind Enron and you, Mr. Lay.  I honestly thought I would leave supporting Enron.  I thought it was the tragic mistake and greed of a FEW employees who took this company down.  However, based on my recent treatment, I have come to realize that there are more than a few greedy people in this company ??" ones that have yet to be recognized.  All I wanted was the one extra check that was due me.  I earned my vacation.  I worked hard and supported this company ??" and I am left with nothing, while management is left with thousands upon thousands of dollars.  I HAD to leave Enron to protect my future.  I never thought the day would come when my words regarding Enron would become resentful.  

Sincerely,

Diana Monaghan

Subject: Myths Surrounding Enron
Dear Family,
 
Obviously, everybody has been inundated with  frustrating, erroneous media stories since what seems like the very beginning of  this nightmare.  My mother-in-law, Sally Pate, called me yesterday and told  me she has been listening to Rush Limbaugh everyday on the internet from 11 a.m.  to 2 p.m. (cst).  Quite honestly, I haven't thought about our good ole'  friend Rush since our incredible "NYC FAMILY TRIP" when we got to see him in  action--live.  So yesterday, I tuned in to see what he had to say about the  current state of Enron and its impact on the U.S. financial and political  arenas.  Incredibly, the experience was refreshing because it was nice to  hear someone reporting the facts as well as disproving a lot of theories and  statements which the media and politicians have been wrongly voicing.  His  underlying message:  it's the media's job to report the news (the good, the  bad, and the ugly), but it's their responsibility to report the facts and not  gossip.  Therefore, we as a society can accurately form opinions based  on truth, not lies.   
 
I've attached the following web site page which  highlights some of Rush's comments.
 
Love,
 
David.
 
 
P.S.  KEN, I LOVE YOU AND PRAY FOR YOU  EVERYDAY.  GO KEN GO!

  <content type="text" name="message">Ken,

This gentleman joined Enron Europe following our acquisition of MG PLC in early 2000. While I think it prudent for us to conduct an independent review (I have asked a member of Cindy's ER team to take a look at this), it does appear to me on first pass that he is essentially unhappy that we are not prepared to pay him 2 years pay in the event he voluntarily terminates his employment with us.

Just for clarity, I do not believe he is being asked to leave the company. In fact, as I understand it,  his extended illness prevents him from being focused on as a redundancy target. In addition, he along with several other Enron Metals employees do have more generous contractual notice periods in their UK employment agreements that do trigger a significantly higher sum in the event of termination than most of our UK employees (up to a years pay).

I will update you further when I have more information.

Dear Mr Lay,

I write to you as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Enron
Corporation because I would like you to know that I am on my second period
of sick leave in a year due to work related stress.

A year ago I was apologised to by the Human Resources Department and told
that they would not allow it to happen again.  Through constant pressure and
the unfair way in which I have been treated, the advice of my doctor and
counsellor, as they are concerned with my health, was to accept the
voluntary redundancy which had been offered to my colleagues and myself
recently.

Though due to my exceptional circumstances I wrote the attached letter.

Today I received the attached response and I feel totally devastated that
Enron Europe will not compensate me fairly for how they have affected my
life and that of my family's.

I read in Enron's literature that you care about your employees and their
families, and feel that your code of ethics should have offered me
protection against the circumstances that I find myself in, but to my
complete and utter dismay I find this is not the case and  in my
experience I have suffered a great deal and this seems to have been totally
ignored in the response letter.  I haven't once been contacted by Enron
Europe to see how I'm coping and give me any support whatsoever.  They are
showing no care or concern for me or my family.

I write to you for help in this matter and to conclude this stressful
situation that I find myself in due to your company.

Under the circumstances and increased stress that the response letter has
put upon me, I would be most grateful if you would respond to me as soon as
possible.

Yours sincerely

David Mortimer

Subject:	Request For Assistance

Mr. Lay:

I would greatly appreciate your assistance in helping to strengthen a relationship EES has with Sysco Corporation.  

EES and Sysco began discussing a wide array of business opportunities with one another in the Fall of last year. On June 30th of this year, we entered into a 10 year electricity supply contract for all of Sysco's California facilities.  We are currently pursuing two important Q4 transactions with Sysco; an electricity supply contract for their Texas facilities and a demand side management contract for all of their facilities.

We had planned to close the Texas supply transaction today.  However, in a phone conversation I had this morning with Sysco's Director of Procurement, Terry Taylor I was informed that Sysco's CEO, Charles Cotros has instructed Mr. Taylor not to enter into any further transactions with us "until Enron's financial picture clears up".  Mr. Taylor believes that Mr. Cotros' concerns about Enron would be diminished if he received a call from a senior executive at Enron. 

Rosalee indicated that you and Mr. Cotros serve together on the Board of Directors for the Greater Houston Partnership. Would you please call Mr. Cotros and attempt to assuage his concerns about our financial condition.  Mr. Cotros is out of the office until Thursday, November 1st.  His direct phone number is (281) 584-1415.  His assistant is Andrea Walters and her phone number is (281) 584-1405.   Mr. Cotros' biography is as follows:   

Charles H. Cotros, age 64, has served as a director of SYSCO since 1985.  Mr. Cotros has served as Chairman of the Board since July 2000 and as Chief Executive Officer since January 2000.

I greatly appreciate your reply, I also agree that the merger was the best alternative, given the circumstances. It saddens me to think that I will not be working for Enron, I had planned to retire from here.  I pray that you will be at peace with your decision and that you will have a happy retirement, put it all behind you and know that you did everything you could and we have a great amount of respect and appreciation for you.  We will definitely miss you and your leadership.  I hope that Dynegy appreciates the value that they are obtaining and the gift of the talented and innovative employees that they will be getting.  Everything will work out for the best.

Thank you again for your response.

Always dedicated,

I very much appreciate your e-mail and agree with most of what you said.  But for very practical reasons, the management and the Board decided a merger with Dynegy was the best alternative for Enron.

Thank you,

Dear Mr. Lay,

My manager and I were discussing the possibility of doing a fund raiser for Enron.  We contributed an absorbant amount of money to charities this year and last, would it not be possible to raise money to help our company.  Do a little belt tightening.  We could do without the Christmas party, do without our bonuses and next year at this time, when we are back on top, it would be a sweeter glory knowing that the employees helped turn everything around.  I have spoken with my HR rep and several other employees about this possibility and we feel that we would be able to raise a substantial amount of money.  Please let me know what your view on this would be and we will work on what steps we need to take to make it happen.

Thank you for your time.

Please is there anything we can do?, maybe get together our own finances to help Enron.  What if there was a way we (The Enron Family) could gather the funds needed to stay ENRON.  We're pretty much will to do whatever it takes.  Enron is our company and we're here.  Noone asked the employees if they were willing to help out.  We can all attempt to get loans and give the money to Enron.  If you'd ask, you'd be suprised as to the respone you'd get.  We love the company and are willing to do what it takes.  Enron is Enron.

I hope this prosposal gets address in some way.  We're here to help and serve you Mr. Lay.

  <content type="text" name="message">Mr Lay - If you really think that this sale creates a "great opportunity" for shareholders then you are more out of touch with reality than I previously thought (unless you were referring to Dynegy shareholders). Under your "leadership" the shareholders have been devastated, employees have lost their retirements, college funds have been desiminated and reputations have been ruined, including your own. 

While I applaud your forgoing of the $60 million dollar payment I suspect having taken it would have only added to outrage and probably weakend your position in forthcoming lawsuits and don't feel that it was as self efacing as you have lead us to believe . Under your direction Enron has promoted bafoons, charletons and incompetents to the highest management ranks.  You personally did everything imaginable to lose the confidence of the investment community, in my opinion. This has got to be the financial disaster of the decade, all under your direction.

You said Jeff Skilling left for "personal reasons" and there were not hidden financial problems. You told us you were becoming more transparent in financial disclosures and then tried to slip a $1.2 Billion dollar equity reduction by us. The list goes on and on. Why should we believe you now.

One more thing Mr. Lay. I suggest  take the listing of  "executive awards" off the internet site. I suspect new "awards" will be coming out soon. And please don't waste your time sending me self serving "feel good" memos anymore. I finally caught on to you.

Ken Lay - Office of the Chairman
11/10/2001 07:17 AM
Sent by:	General Announcement
To:	All Enron Worldwide Distribution Group

Subject:	Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at &lt;http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com &lt;mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.

  <content type="text" name="message">

    Dear Mr. Lay ,

                   I was employed as an EGLI employee twelve years ago and currently I am a contractor with EES power company . My wife has been

                   with ENRON for fifteen years eversince she came out of U of H . Our hearts bleed ENRON blood and they were wounded deeply last

                   Friday night when we saw you on TV announcing the sale of ENRON to Dynergy . We are and still very grateful to all the good things 

                   that ENRON has provided to our family ( we have three children) and feel so blessed to be associated with such a caring and generous

                   company . 

                    Mr Lay , we love you , respect you and most of all we trust you to do everything in your power to help to save ENRON and in process

                    all of its employees . Our hearts were broken when we saw your face in that Friday announcement . The stress of giving up "your child"

                    away can be devastated and I think you have aged greatly the last three weeks or so . The stress impact was almost the same as that

                     which I saw on Mr . Michael Cappellas as he announced the sale of Compaq to HP sometimes ago . Please beleive us we felt this way

                     whether you gave back the 60 millions or not . ( I felt you deserve the money because under your leadership ENRON has growthed

                      tremendously the last fifteen years or so and hence all the people here including the critics have the jobs that they currently have and 

                      99.99 % of them would have taken the money anyway besides that what are the reasonable compensation to a leader that have tripled

                      or quadrupled shareholders values ?. Look at Michael Eisner , Larry Orvitz and dozen other Fortune 500 CEO 's compensation including 

                      those that have not added any values to their respective companies during their tenure and they will see your compensation are justified .  
    

                     Throughout the years we saw so many changes at ENRON and most disturbing fact is the expenses ( G &amp; A ,outside contractors ,consultant ...)

                      go up thru the roof . Since I am a contractor  I knew how much ENRON paid for such services , me and my wife were trying to do our parts by she

                      wrote and sent an e-mail to Mr Rick Causey suggesting ways to cut down outside contractor 's cost because whatever the savings will be

                      reflected directly to the bottom lines .

                       
                       Mr Lay , whatever happened we will allways trust you to steer ENRON into the right path and we truly wish you Health ,Prosperity and

                       Happiness to you and your family . Thank you for reading this e-mail . Sincerely , Joseph Nguyen .

  <content type="text" name="message">Steve Kean and I believe quite strongly, within a four peer group structure,  that we need to allocate somewhere between 30 and 50 percent of Gov't./ public  Affairs out of commercial support into specialized technical- there is a clear divide between individuals in the Gov't/public  Affairs groups  who are managing significant risk for the company and having a significant and  direct impact on commercial activities/ net income( these individuals should be moved to specialized technical)....and others who are performing a less strategic function( who should remain in the commercial support category). With that said, it is probably not necessary to undertake this effort for  mid-year PRC purposes since we are probably moving to a three peer stucture where that split could be achieved (for year-end purposes where the compensation impact would be felt). If we stay with the four group stucture, I intend to push hard for the remapping of Gov't Affairs by year-end.
    On a completely seperate issue, I continue to be  very concerned about the impact of the "preferred" distribution  relative to the bottom category for " commercial support" groups(I'm not implying this is'nt an issue for commercial groups- I just don't have the same ability to assess the impact there)....the concern, simply stated,  is that  it may be entirely  counterproductive to force individuals who are not performance problems  into a category that has significant implications for their careers here at Enron, particularly after going thru the past year where many of the non-performers in my group and others  were moved out of the company- the replacement costs for moving good performers out of the company for the sake of a "preferred" distribution are quite high...and that is even before you begin  to assess the incalcuable damage to morale that will invariably occour.
       Thanks.

Subject:	PEER GROUP MAPPING

Following my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group mapping for all business units. This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.

We were considering moving to a 3 Peer Group Structure however it as agreed at the last PRC Committee Meeting  to stay with the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most activities had been placed with the exception of just  2 or 3. It was agreed that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 Peer Groups. All functions/activities within the business units should now be reflected on the acttached. 

The actions points from this excercise are:

1	to review and agree the attached mapping 

2    consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in previous PRC meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them 	as indicated on the attachment.

3	invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider questionable or requiring further explanation.

      Please return your comments to David Oxley by Friday May 25.

      To have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final VP/MD PRC Meetings.  Definitions of the peer groups are also attached for your ease of
      reference.

Mr. Lay,

I want to thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to help me
with my job venture.  I really admire Enron as a company would like to
learn and become a part of your team.

I look forward to assisting you and Enron where ever you need help.

  <content type="text" name="message">Dear Ken:

We have very serious offers out to two young - but very highly
regarded - economists doing work in areas of interest to Enron.
(Please see enclosed.)

Hendricks is being recruited for one of the Lay family chairs.

Rust, now at Yale, is being recruited for our new university-wide
Center in Computational Economics and Finance.  His work is likely to
be of considerable interest to Enron.

>Subject: Hendricks and Rust - research of interest to Enron
>
>Malcolm:
>
>You requested some notes on the potential interest of Enron in the
>research of Ken Hendricks (the proposed occupant of the Lay family
>chair in industrial organization) and John Rust (the proposed
>appointee from Yale to the Center in Computational Finance and
>Economics). The research programs of Hendricks and Rust look
>extremely exciting and bode well for a very productive relationship
>between Enron and the economics department at Rice were we to succeed
>in recruiting both of these outstanding economists at the peak of
>their careers.
>
>1. Ken Hendricks:  (Visiting U.T. Austin - professor at U.B.C.)
>
>Ken is regarding as one of the leading experts (along with his
>co-author) on testing the implications of auction theory for
>real-world auctions. In particular, Ken and his co-author (Rob Porter
>from Northwestern) pioneered the study of auctions of Outer
>Continental Shelf (OCS) oil and gas leases. The work on auction
>theory is one of the most spectacular successes of strategic modeling
>in economic analysis. It has influenced the design of emerging
>markets for gas and electricity, pollution permits and the FCC
>auctions of parts of the electromagnetic spectrum for communications
>services. The empirical verification of many of the detailed
>predictions of auction theory by Hendricks and a handful of other
>scholars has been critical to the influence of that theory on the
>design of new resource allocation mechanisms. Ken is keen to extend
>his empirical work on auctions to other more recent examples.
>
>Ken's interest in the oil and gas industry extends beyond the auction
>of leases. He has also worked on oil exploration and production,
>strategic issues in the gasoline market and oil and gas pipelines.
>
>Ken Hendricks has also produced ground-breaking research on the
>economic analysis of networks. The initial application of this work
>has been to the airline industry. Ken is keen, however, to apply the
>insights gained from this analysis to other network industries. In
>particular, he is keen to study the electricity and natural gas
>industries not only from the network perspective but also from the
>perspective of auction theory.
>
>2. John Rust:  (Yale - young full professor)
>
>In a recent theoretical paper, written with a colleague from Yale,
>John Rust studies the conditions under which a "market maker" can
>enter a commodity market and gather a substantial market share and
>substantial profits, while at the same time making the market more
>efficient by driving out the least efficient middle men and reducing
>the average bid/ask spreads charged by the surviving middle men in the
>market. This research is of relevance to  "emerging markets" in so far
>as falling transaction and information costs have played a critical role
>in allowing such markets to develop.
>
>As part of this research program, John has developed a relationship
>with a large New England steel service center, which is essentially a
>"middle man" in the regional steel market. The firm buys large
>quantities of steel domestically and internationally, storing these
>as inventories in its warehouses, and subsequently selling the steel
>to retail customers in the New England area at a markup. There is no
>formal market for steel, such as exists for gold or platinum on the
>London Metal Exchange or for commodities such as wheat on the Chicago
>Mercantile Exchange. John believes that his work on the steel market
>is likely to be of substantial interest to Enron.
>
>John and his co-author argue that the first market makers entering
>the steel market, esteel.com and metalsite.com do not have the
>correct business model (they fail to post publicly observable prices
>and are more akin to computerized chat rooms where private
>negotiations occur) and thus are unlikely to be successful in
>transforming the market for steel. However the site gofish.com does
>have a good business model and is rapidly transforming the market for
>commercial purchases of fish in the U.S.
>
>How does this relate to Enron? Enron Industrial Markets (EIM) is
>serving the role of market maker in a number of different commodities
>such as natural gas and electricity. Coincidentally EIM just made a
>presentation of its plans to enter as a market maker in the steel
>market, and the executives at the steel company that John and his
>co-author work with in Connecticut shared with John an impressive
>binder from a recent presentation by EIM. After
>discussing this presentation with the general manager and studying
>the presentation binder, John feels that Enron's business plan is
>much more likely to succeed than either esteel.com or metalsite.com.
>His analysis of the steel market suggests that there are considerable
>informational imperfections, and that there is ample room for
>successful, profitable entry by a leading company such as Enron that
>has an intelligent and aggressive business plan. John believes that
>Enron is in a strong position to succeed in the steel market using
>its experience in other markets, their successful enrononline.com
>trading site, and their huge financial resources that would enable
>them to conduct the marketing operations to get their market off the
>ground.
>
>The other area where John feel's that his research could connect to,
>and be useful for, Enron in steel and other commodities markets is
>his work on using dynamic programming methods to solve for and
>compute optimal speculative trading strategies. John is perhaps the
>world expert in calculating optimal policies with regard to managing
>inventory levels. These include the optimal timing of purchase
>decisions, the optimal quantities to purchase when purchases are
>optimal, and the optimal markups of retail prices over wholesale
>prices. John and his co-author have developed computer programs that
>can rapidly compute the optimal policies (in less than 2 minutes on
>an ordinary PC) for the steel distributor he has been working with in
>New England. They plan to deliver a computerized version of their
>trading strategy on a laptop computer to the executives at the steel
>company. John and his co-author hope to compare how the trading
>profits generated by the computer program compare to the trading
>profits that would be earned if the firm continued with its current
>business practices.
>
>John's work may be of interest to Enron since it can be extended to
>predictions of the optimal inventory holdings and bid/ask spread that
>should be quoted by a market maker like Enron. John and his co-author
>are currently working on extending their model to predict how traders
>in the steel market would value various options and futures contracts
>for hedging risks, leading to predictions for the pricing of these
>derivative financial instruments.
>
>John would be very keen to attain a close working relationship with
>Enron. He believes such a relationship could have a huge effect on
>the course of his research, spawning a number of additional new
>research projects that would benefit students and faculty at Rice as
>well as having substantial potential benefit for Enron.

  <content type="text" name="message">Ken,

I was pleased to have an opportunity to meet with you and Linda in April to
discuss the Library/Honors campaign.  To date, over $12.3 million has been
raised and we have several proposals outstanding.  I'm writing to ask your
help with Jack Trotter, a trustee of the Vivian L. Smith Foundation.

Earlier this year you indicated that you would be willing to sign a letter
to Mr. Trotter on behalf of the Library/Honors building project.  Enclosed
is a draft of the letter.  A proposal for $250,000 was submitted to the
Foundation in May, the trustees are scheduled to meet on June 15.  Mr.
Trotter is a trustee with both the M.D. Anderson Foundation (which has
already committed $1 mil to the library/honors project) and the Vivian L.
Smith Foundation.  The Smith Foundation provided a grant of $500k to the
KUHT/KUHF Melcher building that opened last fall.

Please let me know if you have any question regarding the enclosed letter.
Also, please fax or e-mail the final letter to me at the address below.

Thank you very much.

  <content type="text" name="message"><![CDATA[June 8, 2001


Dear LINDA LAY:

We are delighted that you have made a smart energy choice by signing up
with NewPower(tm) as part of the Texas Electric Choice Pilot Program.
Tens of thousands of Texas households have joined you in taking advantage
of the tremendous savings NewPower will provide you over the next two years.

As your new energy supplier, we wanted to make sure that you were informed
of a recent development affecting you as a participant of the pilot
program. NewPower was recently notified by the Texas Public Utility
Commission (PUC) that the pilot program will be phased in more slowly
over the summer months. A more gradual timetable for processing switches
from your local utility to energy service providers, such as NewPower,
will help to ensure a seamless transition between energy suppliers for
the thousands of Texans who have enrolled in the program.

Click below to read the official announcement from the Texas PUC. This
requires you to have Adobe Acrobat Reader:
http://i2.innovyx.com/newpower/pilot_ltr.pdf

If you do not have Adobe Acrobat Reader, please click below and follow
instructions for free download:
http://tr.innovyx.com/redir.asp?148_46_1267

What does this mean for you? It simply means that your NewPower service
will begin during July instead of June as originally planned. Until then,
your existing provider will continue to provide your electricity,
uninterrupted. Rest assured, once your NewPower service begins, you'll
still get the same great rates and excellent customer service you were
promised when you signed up.

There is no need for you to take any action.  NewPower expects that the
Texas Public Utility Commission will enable us to begin providing your
household with electric service after July 6th.

In the meantime, NewPower will send a welcome letter notifying you of the
effective date of your NewPower service.  If you have any questions or
concerns, please visit the Public Utility Commission's website at
http://tr.innovyx.com/redir.asp?148_47_1267 or call NewPower
at 877-819-9817. (For help in Spanish, call 1-866-523-4176.)

Best regards, and welcome to NewPower!

Nick Utton
Chief Marketing Officer

Dear Rosalie, 
Thank you for taking my call last week.  I understand that you are planning to check with Mr. Lay as to when he might be available to take a telephone call from Stuart Kauffman.  As I mentioned, Stuart and Mr. Lay have met on a few occasions and have some common business strategies to discuss.  The initial call would  take just fifteen minutes.  Please let me know when you can confirm a date and time.  My phone number is 505-954-3760.
Thanks again!

  <content type="text" name="message">Mr. Lay:

In view of the events of past weeks surrounding Enron's stock, I am taking the liberty of writing this note to you. I will try to keep this brief. First of all, I want to say that  you are doing a terrific job. With your leadership we will turn this around soon. May God bless you and your family so you can continue leading this great company out of this crisis. I have been with the company for almost 21 years. I remember the difficult days that we have been through during this time . Particularly I remember like yesterday when I used to be in Omaha and you came there and, talked to all of us and gave us hope and your commitment to turn things around in those uncertain and difficult days after the merger and promised to make this a great company. We all rallied behind you and we turned this company into one of the greatest company in the world. We are with you now, and with your leadership we will turn this around again. For most of us, Enron is not just a place to work. It is part of us.  It is our family. It is our life. In the current situation the pain we feel is the same as if one of our loved one was seriously sick and we did not know what to do except to follow the advise of the doctor. We will follow your advise and give you our 200% . On a personal level for me this a very emotional and painful time. I have grown with this company that has given me great opportunities.  Currently I am working in Bolivia as president of Gas TransBoliviano and feel perhaps there is something I should be doing to help in this situation. Mr. Lay, If there is anything I can do above and beyond my current job, please let me know. You have my commitment and I will not disappoint you. Please consider me like one of those guys in NY showing up with shovels to help after the WTC disaster. I am hoping that I will be called upon. Again, may God bless you and your family. Look forward to seeing you in San Antonio.

With Kind Regards,

A friend of mine sent me this message.  The news of their friends is so
tragically sad.  Being a mother of 2 (almost 3) makes me ache for their

Please include them in your prayers.

	Some additional information just provided by the State Department:  UnderSecretary of State Alan Larson met with Mishra and the Foreign Minister in his meetings in India and raised the need for the GOI to address and resolve Dabhol.  He received from them a commitment to "get the government energized towards a solution before the PM comes to Washington."

	The Embassy called to confirm that the Indian Prime Minister now plans to be in Washington on November 7.  We talked of a meeting on November 8 with the Secretary of the PMO.  Who would be best to take the meeting? 

	The US-India Business Council is also planning a letter to the PM which would underscore the short time left for negotiations and the need for the GOI to designate a schedule for meeting. One would think the PM would want to have made progress before arriving in Washington, but ...  John  </content>

  <content name="title" action="cluster">Yesterday's Call: Feedback</content>
  <content type="text" name="message">Ken,

Thanks for having the call yesterday.  I am a believer in Enron and we are
buying your debt.

Here's short feedback on the call.  I give the call a B-/C+ grade.  If you
want a good example of a company call listen to the tougher calls So Cal Ed
had for investors.  They talked with investors twice weekly for months.
There is an honestness and openness about the calls that worked to keep
investors informed.

The angry exchange with the short seller was a blunder.  No matter what the
question, no matter how stupid or obnoxious, the Enron answer should always
be empathetic and pointedly factual.  Yes, you will have to open the kimono
more than Enron ever has to restore confidence.

ENE has become more a financial institution, and less an energy company
with hard assets.  You are in a confidence game pure and simple.  Any
attempt at keeping things close to the vest will backfire and exacerbate
the current crisis.  If you want to see disclosure in financials, look at
Citi's...

ENE is having an encounter session with the entire investment community.
This is not a time to be aggressive and smart.  It is a time to be open,
honest and self-effacing.

Third party confirmation will go a long way in restoring confidence which
means 1) Moody's maintains their rating or limits the change to a one-notch
downgrade (bond rating) with stable outlook restored (the Moody's analyst
is pissed you surprised with the write-off), 2) the SEC gives ENE a fairly
clean report (no self-dealing found) on their transactions with private
equity partnerships, 3) no more large surprise write-offs, 4) outside
auditors continue with unqualified audit reports, 5) operating earnings
targets are met for this year and next, and 6)fuller disclosure is made in
quarterly releases.

Of course, if any fraud or malfeasance is found, you guys and ENE are
history.

I have my ass on the line because I believe in ENE.  We have made
investments.  ENE is in the shitter because of ENE's past communication and
behavior mistakes.  Be humble, be smart, and change.

Good Luck!

Jeff

P.S.  You state there is a Chinese wall between LJM and ENE.  Why in the
world then would you have the same guy, Fastow, play key controlling roles
in both organizations?  If you want to pay him, pay him.  Keep it simple.

I am glad Skilling is gone.  I wouldn't touch your company's debt while he
was there.  I hated him and his attitude?.and my past exposure to him was
extremely limited.

	The Embassy called to confirm that the Indian Prime Minister now plans to be in Washington on November 7.  We talked of a meeting on November 8 with the Secretary of the PMO.  Who would be best to take the meeting? 

	The US-India Business Council is also planning a letter to the PM which would underscore the short time left for negotiations and the need for the GOI to designate a schedule for meeting. One would think the PM would want to have made progress before arriving in Washington, but ...  John  </content>

  <content type="text" name="message">Dear Family,

Please see the attached schedules for preseason and regular games for the
Houston Rockets through November.  Because we all have very busy lives and
find it impossible to confirm too far in advance, I will wait closer to each
game before distributing tickets.  Also, Ken's schedule is a moving target
and it would make it much easier for him to squeeze in at least one game
this year, if we could do it on shorter notice.  Our eight basketball seats
are amazing and the tickets are a hot item, so hopefully everyone will try
to make this work and have fun doing it.

I will wait at least seven days before each game to distribute the tickets.
If you have any interest in pre-selecting certain games that you definitely
want to attend, please advise me and I will put your name on the list with
an * next to it.  Additionally, if you think you know your schedule and
would like to be considered in the ticket distribution for certain games, I
will put your name on the list with a ? next to your name.  Once your name
is on the list and as each game gets closer, I would appreciate it if you
would contact me ASAP when you find out that you are unable to attend.
Everyone has said that they want to be fair and rotate, so that each family
member has a shot at attending a game and getting both kinds of tickets.
Hopefully, we can all work it out.  However, in the event that we have more
requests than tickets for the same game, and we are unable to settle it, I
will have Barb pull names out of a hat.  Once you confirm your attendance,
tickets can be put in an envelope with your name on them and sent down to
the doorman at the Huntingdon for you to pick up.

For any games where our immediate family is not able to use the tickets,
they will be distributed to other lucky recipients in a rotating order.  I
will have Barb draw your names and ours out of a hat to create the rotation.
If you have other family members or someone special that you would like to
offer tickets to, let me know.  I can either contact you and have you
contact them or you can give me their names and contact information and Barb
will contact them directly, as you wish.

In the event that I am traveling or cannot be reached, please contact Barb
as she will be copied in on all current schedules and have access to the
tickets.  GO ROCKETS!

Love, Mom/Linda

  <content type="text" name="message">Dear Ken,

I wrote you some time back about the campaign to raise ca. $4 million to
replace the American Heart Association's Houston regional headquarters
building which burned this past April.  You were so kind in putting us in
touch with Cindy Olson and Misha Siegel to discuss Enron's corporate
position and the potential for assistance from the Ken and Linda Lay
Foundation.  We deeply appreciated our meeting with Cindy and Misha.

Things have been progressing I'm pleased to say.  AHA has concluded a deal
to sell the restored old building for approximately $1.15 million, and we
have received substantial commitments from a very few individuals and
Houston area foundations totaling approximately $600,000.  Therefore, our
remaining challenge is to raise around $2-$2.25 million to complete the
funding of a new building that will meet the needs of AHA in the years to
come.

We have not yet been able to identify a very visible corporate or
professional lead for the effort.  We will be discussing this possibility
with Ernie Cockrell on November 6th.  As part of that conversation we would
like to indicate notable leaders in Houston who would be willing to have
their names affiliated with the capital campaign, perhaps as an Executive
Committee or Advisory Committee.  The question to you is:  Would you approve
the use of your name in your capacity at Enron and/or the name of the Ken
and Linda Lay Foundation in this way?

Again, the AHA and I have been so deeply appreciative of your willingness to
support the American Heart Association for so many years.  I hope we can
call on you for this additional assistance at a time of need.

Thanks, Ken, for your consideration.

Best regards,

In that role, we are "working" a number of Texas Democrats.  I will talk again with the Congresswoman, and will call on Steve Kean to work her if needed.  No need for Ken's involvement with her at this point.

I asked Jim Kollaer if he had talked to our Washington office and he said they have been working on it, but this is going to take a call from Ken to Sheila.  Given the complexities of his schedule, if there is any other way, it would be good.  What do you think?

Ken, I am writing to ask Enron's assistance with a pro-Trade Promotion
Authority message to Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee.

The position of the Partnership and Enron are well known to Sheila.  She
consistently has voiced doubts about her ability to vote for trade
issues such as China PNTR and fast track/TPA, but in the end joins her
pro-business and trade colleagues in supporting these measures. You have
always been a very effective lobbyist on this issue.

Most recently, on October 10, 2001, Rep. Lee told Rep. Norman Dicks
(D-WA) (he was the first D to be a supporter of this new compromise leg
(HR 3005) and is whipping the issue for the Ds) that she is a no vote on
TPA (HR 3005).

Rep. Lee's reasons for not supporting this issue are as follows:

1. The process has been too partisan, Ds like Rep. Charles Rangel were
not consulted and brought to the table to develop compromise language in
the beginning.

2. Since only 25 - 30 Ds will be voting for this (and we need her to be
one of those) she will feel alone as a D.

ACTION REQUESTED:  Ken, could you or someone senior at Enron place a
call to Rep. Jackson Lee to voice strong support for TPA?

An appropriate message is that we want her to focus on good public
policy.  We are not defending the process.  This is about good
economics.  TPA benefits her consituents.

We have attached a study that highlights the benefits of trade in her
district.  This may be useful information.  It has employment numbers
and more.

The TPA vote could come next week, as early as Tuesday.  A call to her
here in Houston at 713-655-0050 would be appropriate, as the House is
recessed until Tuesday.

Thanks in advance for your positive response to this request.

Play by play during the call on the 5yr Enron Credit Default Swaps from Morgan Stanley:

1.  5Y BIDS GETTING HIT ON OPENING AS EARNINGS NEWS LOOKED LIKE
    CLEANING HOUSE.  250.
2.  DURING THE CONFERENCE CALL; WHICH APPARENTLY WAS UNCLEAR,
    TICKED OUT 255,260,265.
3.  LAY INDICATED NEAR END OF CONFERENCE "NO RATINGS ACTION
    ANTICIPATED".   MINUTE CONFERENCE ENDED MOODY'S WATCH NEWS
    RELEASED.  280 BID.
4.  LAY ALSO MENTIONED 3Q NEG CASH FLOW DUE TO SOME CONTRACT
    ROLLOFF.  UNCLEAR MESSSAGE.
5.  ENE SAYS COMMITTED TO "INV GRADE" RATHER THAN "A"  280/325


Summary from Morgan Stanley after the call:

CREDIT DERIVATIVE UPDATE:  ENRON CORP

AFTER THE NEWS THIS AM ($1 BIL. CHARGE), THE COMPANY HOSTED A
CALL AT 10AM NY TIME.   THE CALL DID NOT GO WELL &amp; ENRON SPREADS
ARE HEADING WIDER IN CREDIT DERIVATIVE LAND.  MKTS ARE SPOOKED
B/C:  1) MOODY'S WATCHLISTED CO NEGATIVE, 2) ENE STATED "THEY
ARE COMMITED TO INVESTMENT GRADE RATING," WHICH IS A CHANGE FROM
THE SINGLE-A BOGEY THEY ONCE EXTOLED, 3) CO. DID NOT ADDRESS ALL
LIQUIDITY CONCERNS, AND 4) MORE CHARGES COMING?
5YR MARKETS:

      ENE (PRE-WTC):   165/185        ENE (8AM TODAY): 240/260
      ENE (WEEK AGO):  250/300      **ENE NOW:         275/350

Clearly the above are a function of what people think they heard...I did not alter any of the email.  In general MSDW likes Enron credit but this is how they see the market.  Enron is one of the most actively traded names in the credit derivative market.  Let me know if you want updates as the market gets more clarity and works throught the details</content>

Massey Villarreal has asked to meet with Mr. Lay, if possible, this
Wednesday afternoon.  He would like to discuss small business development
and Center for Houston's Future with him.

Massey and Mr. Lay serve together on the Partnership board and has asked me
to assist him in coordinating the meeting.  Would you please let me know if
it would be possible to have that meeting?

I may be reached by phone at 713-644-7070, extension 228.

  <content type="text" name="message">Dear Jenny,

I refer to our phone conversation of today 12.10.01.

As Dr Lay has registered for our Energy Governors Meeting in Davos I sent
him an invitation to the Preparatory Meeting. The purpose of the
Preparatory Meeting is to brainstorm on possible topics and discussion
leaders for the programme of the Governors Meeting for Energy which will
take place from 3 to 5 February 2002, and to identify the latest trends in
the industry.

In order to prepare a successful Governors Meeting, the issue selection is
primordial. I am pleased that among the first confirmations for the
Preparatory Meeting we received confirmations from ABB Ltd, ENI SPA, Royal
Dutch/Shell, Statoil Group, Ruhrgas, EDF, Duke Energy Corporation, Engen
Petroleum Ltd, Gaz de France, some of which will be represented by their
top-executives.

As it is impossible for Dr Lay to participate at the Preparatory Meeting,
we would be most grateful if you could nominate a delegate as well as send
us his preliminary ideas on interesting issues and panellists for the
programme. Of course, I am fully aware what a long way it is to go for a
one-day meeting from Houston to Geneva.

This Preparatory Meeting is scheduled for Tuesday 6 November from 08.30 to
16.00 and will be held at World Economic Forum Headquarters in Cologny. We
would also like to invite this person to an informal dinner on the previous
evening, Monday 5 November at 19.30, at the Hotel Beau-Rivage in Geneva (13
quai du Mont-Blanc, 1201 Geneva, Tel. 41 22/716 6666).

Please find enclosed some suggested topics for your consideration.

(See attached file: issues.doc)

Should you have any questions concerning the Governors Meeting, please do
not hesitate to contact me any time.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely,
Christoph Frei

Sometimes I am not sure if Ken has had dialogue with any of these guys or  is it a cold call.  Unless Ken objects, I don't think that we want to waste  anytime with guys.  They all want "just a few minutes of your time"  which adds up to a lot of minutes.

Mr.  Lay,
 
Hello.  Tori left a message requesting me to  send my invitation to you again...we really feel is it vital that now, more than  ever, our top military leaders need to hear from the private sector's top  leaders (like yourself) so that we can learn from their mistakes and  capitalize on their success.  I truly hope you will consider speaking  to this prestigious group of gentlemen who are the decision makers in  our proud military.  I look forward to hearing from  you.

Dear Mr.  Lay,
 
Hello...On behalf of Barry Frew, founding Director of the Center for  Executive Education (CEE) located at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey,  California, I would like to invite you to be a guest speaker at the CEE for our  Revolution in Business Practices (RBP) Course - we believe you could most  definitely add value to our RBP Course for Executive Education which is a two-  week, high-quality, customized, executive-level program for Flag Officers,  Generals and Senior Executive Service members ( people who truly impact our  military).  We encourage provocative  discussions and would thoroughly enjoy hearing about your experiences and  knowledge regarding leadership, management, job satisfaction, retention, rewards,  etc. 
 
Our upcoming courses are October 22nd-November 2nd,  2001; February 4th-15th, 2002; June  rd-14th, 2002; August 5th-16th,  2002.  We are hoping these dates will work for you during one of  the scheduled courses.  For further  information, our main web site is www.cee.nps.navy.mil .   Additionally, you can find some of our previous speakers (including Larry  Ellison - Oracle, John Chambers - Cisco Systems, Alfred Berkley III - NASDAQ,  etc.) at http://www.cee.nps.navy.mil/speakers.htm .  
 
If you have any questions or need additional information, please give  me a call...I would love the opportunity to tell you more about who we are and  what a difference we are making in the United States military.  I anxiously await your response!  
 
Sincerely,
Lane A. Fabby

Subject:	2002 Corporate Allocations to EIM


Attached please find the corporate allocations for the 2002 fiscal year that EIM will accept.  After unsuccessfully attempting to get some justification for the PROPOSED allocations from many of the various corporate groups, we have had to make a determination ourselves as to what we believe are reasonable charges for the value received from these groups.  This determination was based on several factors including, 2001 actual allocations, expected services provided to EIM, redundant services provided by other groups that are also performed at EIM, etc.

The attached charges are acceptable to EIM and will be used in the budget presentation to the office of the chair unless the allocating groups can come to an agreement with Kent Castleman of EIM as to a revision of these charges before such meeting.

Ken

I just got a note that you sent me regarding a letter from Tadaaki Hashida at NHS requesting that you speak
at their conference (unfortunately it took almost two weeks to get from your desk to mine).  Mike McConnel has the Global Markets lead there (with Joe Hirl reporting to Mike and Joe serves as country manager).  The business that I have is a small metals team and the power development company of 16 employees working 
under the joint venture company ePower.  Nick O'Day runs this company for me.

Mike is the key guy to determine if your time would be well spent from his business perspective but relative to my businesses,
I doubt if it would be the best use of your time.  You may be aware that Mike's team is in the midst of negotiating a larger deal
with Nisho Iwai.  The success of this negotiation is likely to shed a great deal of light on our broader business prospects in Japan.

Ken, we are working with a team that is building ethanol plants throughout
the Southeast and the Midwest, and we are in the process of arranging the
right capital partner as well as identifying the right strategic partner for
that endeavor. The other players in this ambitious project have
relationships into Enron, but I thought that you might be able to shove me
in the right direction of the person to talk to there.

I hope all is well with you, and one day when you are in the DC area and
have nothing better to do you will let me have the opportunity to visit over
dinner and reflect on how many years it has been since you and we created
the Natural Gas Clearing House. We are having a lot of fun putting together
large private equity deals and you might find that aspect of what we do as
possibly interesting as well. We have expanded into the energy and utilities
space as telecomm and technology have had their share of problems. In any
event, would appreciate the input and look forward to a visit in the not too
distant future. Best regards, Tom

Just to advise everyone that Liz and JL will be arriving late for Pop-Pop's
dinner on Friday, October 12, because she is chairing an event that evening.
Her event is billed until 7:30 p.m. but due to the fact that she is a chair
she won't be able to leave until it is over.  Therefore, we will not take
the big group photo until they arrive.  Thanks,  Linda, Mom</content>

  <content name="title" action="cluster">Bush Economic Team "Inept"</content>
  <content type="text" name="message">This is from a morning briefing that goes out to all of the Schwab clients:

So it's a near-certainty that more stimulus is coming from Washington. But
the details change
constantly, as trial balloons are floated and shot down day after day. Some
quick highlights:
? In stark contrast to its foreign policy/defense team, the Bush economic
brain trust looks inept, unable to
coordinate its plans and apparently unwilling to provide much direction to
Congress.
? Filling that vacuum are Republicans who want big tax cuts and Democrats
who want to spend much
more.
? This means the budget surplus in fiscal 2002 is in free fall. It's
possible that the budget could go into
deficit this year, but our guess is that it will be in the black by a
little, probably under $50 billion. But
these estimates aren't worth much right now - the big story is that the
surplus is melting fast.

	Mary, 

	I wanted to let you know how impressed I was with the manner in which Aaron Brown facilitated and managed the preparation of the Purchase, Sale &amp; Reconveyance Agreement for Mr. and Mrs. Lay. In only a few day time, he followed thought in the preparation of the document and coordination of multiple counsel, including in-house and  outside counsel for all parties for review of the document. He solicited comments from all the necessary parties, managed the detail of the transaction and kept the document  on track for  closing on Friday morning. I have to commend him on his efforts in this regard. Job well done.

  <content type="text" name="message">Hello everyone,
I am doing an inquiry as to what each families level
of participation will be for thanksgivings.....  If it
is a immediate family only event, when will you be
arriving in Galveston, how many people in your family
will be there and will you be attending the dinner?

Mr and Mrs Lay will be there from the 21-25th of
November.

If it is a family plus dinner then what will be your
level of participation then?  Please answer all the
above questions as well as who else you would like to
invite?

Please respond by October 5th.
Thanks barb

Hello family and  friends.  I just received this message from, Youri, a friend of mine in  Europe.  He explains that this photo was apparently taken by a tourist  moments before the terrorist airline crash into the World Trade Center and that  the film/camera was found in the ruble and obviously developed.  If this is  real... can you imagine!!!!!!!!!  Totally disturbing, totally  unreal.

  <content type="text" name="message">Mr. Lay,
  My name is Shelley Farias and I work for EES in the 3 Allen Center.  On Friday September 14 at 5:00 P.M. as I was leaving work I saw something that frightened me outside the 3 Allen Center.  In a car parked in the circle drive was a young man about 20 years old of Middle Eastern decent taking pictures of the Enron building and the 3 Allen Center.  Security was at the scene and asked the young man to stop taking the pictures, he got back in his car and continued to take the pictures.  My husband wrote down the license plate number and make of the car and gave this information to security.  Security informed us that they would take care of the situation. I spoke to security this morning and they do not have any report of this incident or the police being notified.   Mr. Lay with everything that has happened to this country I am scared that something may happen to us.  I would like to think I can come to work and be safe, but with security not taking instances such as Friday seriously I have doubts.  Please let me know what I should do contact the police myself or wait on security?

I called your office today and they informed me that the best way to get
this matter to you was to send you an email.  The negotiations between
Silicon Valley Bank and eVelocity have pretty much come to a decision point.
At bottom, Silicon Valley Bank will agree to renew the loan for six months
in exchange for a $250k paydown and monthly interest payments for the next 6
months.  The eVelocity folks tell me that this is slightly better (from a
total cash outlay) than they had proposed, but it does require additional
cash upfront.  In addition to the funds that you indicated that you would be
willing to provide, they have secured an additional $200k from other
investors.

The eVelocity management tells me that the proposed plan gives them the
liquidity they need.

I told them to proceed on that basis until I can get a response from you and
that I would recommend the bank's terms to you.

May I have your agreement?

If you have any questions, you can reach me at 713-515-5686 throughout
Friday and at 970-748-1643 throughout the weekend.

David:

Below is the latest from the Silicon Valley Bank, $250K up front and no
principal payments to January 31, 2002. The deal we proposed to the SVB
last week was $125K up front, $15K for September, October, November,
December, $100K December 31, 2001, and $55K January 31,2002. Total payments
by eVelocity to January 31, 2002 were $340K, $90K less than the $250K up
front.. Also they are not asking for warrants. We have for bridge
financing, pending approval of SVB position, the following: $500K from K.
Lay, $100K from Trillium, $50K from A. Bruce, and $50K from T. Nigrelli. I
am hoping to get another $100K from Ruben Jeffery (runs Goldman Europe).
Assuming we get only $700K for bridge, the Bank's proposed arrangement
leaves us $450K to January 31, 2002 which will keep us cash positive.

Getting the $1 mil loan down to $750K appears to satisfy the Santa Clara,
CA home office that this is a performing loan. We are anxious to move
forward as the Company is close to profitability which will posture it for
a long term fund raising.

Please let us know how Ken Lay feels about this.

Regards, Albert

I would like to note that Bryan, in error, has said that we would suspend
interest payments.  Interest would continue to be due monthly during the
period between now and 1/31/02.  Sorry for the confusion here.

  <content type="text" name="message">Dear Mr. Lay,

I am sure no one could imagine the worry and mental
anguish you have had to endure these past weeks.  I
pray for you that you will continue to have the
strength to move forward during these trying times.

Mr. Lay, I'm really a "nobody".  I started my career
back in 1972 with Northern Petrochemical in Morris
Illinois.  I worked there for two years then quit to
return to college to earn my engineering degree.  I
graduated in 1979 at the age of 29.  Upon graduation,
I hired back with Northern Natural Gas in Liberal
Kansas.  I continued my career with Enron until
January 15 this year.  I had been expat with EE&amp;CC
until Nov. 14, 2000.  When I returned to Houston, I
found out that I had been "redeployed".  To my
disappointment, I was unable to find another position
and was severed on Jan. 15, 2001.  As you can imagine,
by saving my money, working hard, and receiving stock
options, I had accumulated enough money to go ahead
and retire.  I was feeling good about my career, my
life with Enron, the years of sacrificing time and
effort for the betterment of the company.  (You know,
in spite of what's happened since Jan. 15, I still
feel good about all the years I dedicated to the
company.)  You know what else, I still have the upmost
respect and confidence in you.  I really hope your
self confidence is not slipping.  You've accomplished
great things with this company.  You can continue to
lead us through these trying times.  I know you can!

In closing, I just want to say "thanks".  Thanks for
being our leader all these years.  Thanks for the
"wild ride" we've all shared since 1985.  I wouldn't
trade it for the world.  Please know that there are
many of us "nobody" people out here that still wish
you well, pray for you, and hope something positive
will surface in the near future.

Daniel Junk

P.S.  I know the Fed. Gov. loaned Chrysler billions a
few years back when they were against the ropes.  The
emphasis was on saving 200,000 or 300,000 jobs.
Wouldn't they do the same for Enron, considering all
the people whose retirements are dependent upon
Enron's performance?  Not just former employees, but
all investors?

  <content type="text" name="message">Dear CEO Kenneth Lay:

The conversion rate of .15 is not acceptable to shareholders. It should be
at least .2 or above. We need to get bidders and more banks to back up Enron
while talking to Dynergy. .15 ratio was proposed by some analysts who short
the ENE stocks when the price was at above $9. The number .15 was published
in media again last week or so. ENE should not take this outrage number.
These hedge fund and short sellers will be happy if the ratio is .15. I
think .2 ratio is our bottom line.

May god gives you wisdom.

  <content type="text" name="message">Mr. Lay,

These are tough times for our company.  There is a lot of justified anger and deep disappointment among our employees and shareholders.  However, at this time I want to thank you for sticking with us and helping to get the best deal for Enron.  You could have washed your hands, walked away and left us holding the bag.  But, you did not. It is reassuring that you are a CEO who will take the heat and do what is best for the company.  It measures the true character of the man.

It is unfortunate that you placed so much faith in those who have brought our company down.  However, it shows that you like the rest of us are only human.  I've admired your work over the years and am honored I was able to be a part of your organization.  I pray that God will be with you during this turmoil and He will give you strength to see it through. 

I will always remember my days at Enron with pride.  I enjoyed the many great men and women I worked with.  Thank you again, Mr. Lay, for all you have done.

  <content name="title" action="cluster">PERSONAL -- What Enron has meant for me.</content>
  <content type="text" name="message">Dear Dr. Lay: I have worked for 4 years in Enron and wanted to share what working at your company has meant to me.

Enron has been a life changing experience.  A positive life changing experience!  I wish that it wasn't all ending this way (as I am sure you are) but even knowing what I know now, I would still have joined Enron.  I like many people in Enron have come from much smaller, provincial companies that had a more traditional culture.  While they may been more stable, they never would have presented the high quality work opportunities that Enron did.  I have become a more employable and confident person because of Enron.  While there were some aspects of the company's culture and practices that I found questionable, there's no question that my life will be better because I joined your company.  Enron gave me a chance to escape a mediocre professional life and allowed me to realize what I am capable of -- and many companies can't lay claim to that.  I don't know what my immediate future holds-- but I'm sure it will be better than if I had stayed with my old employer.   Thank you for giving me this opportunity.

I'm sure these are trying days for you and I sense that the work you are doing now is more of a labor of love than any type of obligation.  Good luck in the future.  

Best Regards,
VV Rao,
Director, Origination,
Global LNG Group

  <content type="text" name="message">Mr. Lay,

It seems to have become fashionable to bash you and the other executives as things have become challenging at Enron.  I just wanted to let you know that there are some people who still care about Enron and are still thankful for what you have done over the past 15 years.  I have been completely distraught at the speed with which my coworkers have thrown in the towel and have essentially given up.  I urge you to continue to fight for Enron.  True, it may take another 15 years to get back to a leading company, but do not give up the fight.  You have made Enron a wonderful place to work and I know that Enron will survive.  It would be a tragedy if the innovative thinking made famous by Enron were to be discarded and corporate America returned to a status quo mentality.

I have been informed that I am on the list of those to be laid off because I am in a non-core business, and I agree.  I loved having the job, but desperate times call for desperate measures and I understand the need to focus.  I am tired of my fellow coworkers quitting, complaining, and giving up.  There are plenty of people that will join you in the fight, I hope that you are able to weed out the quitters and get a group of people together who will fight for the Enron way of doing business.  

I applaud you for your accomplishments over the past 15 years in building an incredible company - a company that will survive, a company that will once again thrive, and a company that will prosper well into the future.

Good luck and please don't give up,
Zach Streight</content>

  <content type="text" name="message">Dear Mr. Lay
	Through all of the trials and negativity that is occurring I would like to send these words of encouragement from my family and I.  I have been with this company 21 years.  We have had many wonderful and exciting years with Enron.  When I first met my wife six years ago she was 90% in both ears.  Through the blessing of our insurance plan she now today has 98% hearing capacity in both ears.  The many years of working for Enron has provided me with a steady job and a good income, while allowing me to work on my Ph.D.  The many friendships and relationships I have been blessed with through working for this company will be treasured for the rest of my life.  Yes, I am one of the employees who have lost their retirement, but through all of this my wife and I would like to send our vote of confidence to you and the board to be able to find ways to make the impossible happen.  This company was built to be one of the worlds largest companies through your efforts over the past several years.  Yes, there has been experiments in going beyond normal paradigms and there has been mistakes made.  But through the mistakes is where the true gift of learning and stability comes.
	The ultimate challenge in life is not how much money one can make or that first ultimate achievement.  The ultimate challenge in life is "CAN I DO IT AGAIN?" We believe, that Enron can learn from what is happening and eventually become bigger, better, and stronger than it has ever been.  And we believe that you, Ken Lay, CAN DO IT AGAIN, bigger and better than it was done before.  
	I remember once reading about Donald Trump going into bankruptcy.  He summoned before him the best advisors in the world to pull the most educated and smartest financial people together to find a solution, and he moved on to build bigger and better investments.  "HE DID IT AGAIN."
	The true answers to the impossible come from the heart during our quiet moments with ourselves, in these moments I know you will find the answers.  My family and I have chosen to start the turn around of the negativity into a positive direction by believing that you and our board can make the impossible happen.  We have freely chosen to take the last $10,000 we have in our 401k and invest it into Enron Stock as a show of faith to ourselves that we believe the impossible can happen.  If anyone does not have the faith in themselves to make this happen please let our faith in you be yours for now.  Enron has always tried to go beyond the normal paradigms and can take advantage of this tremendous opportunity to create the impossible and do something that has never been done before. "WE CAN DO IT AGAIN!"
	My family and I send all of you our love, faith and belief in yourself to do the impossible

  <content type="text" name="message">Mr. Lay:
 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for all the hard work you are trying to do, and continue to try to do, on behalf of those of us who will always be proud to call Enron 'home'.  I joined Enron a short 11 months ago, and moved from the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission to do so, and will likely never regret taking the leap. I have learned so much of value here, have broadened my horizons by orders of magnitude, and worked with so many top quality people, that I cannot help but feel better for the experience.  I have enjoyed professional success and satisfaction beyond my wildest dreams with Enron, and will always carry the confidence of having succeeded amongst the best there are in the business.  I cannot help but feel terrible that so many wish to lay blame where it does not belong, but I can only assume that in times of crisis, laying blame may soothe nerves and provide some comfort.  Know that there are still many at Enron who admire the enormity of what you have done for energy markets in the United States, and have never doubted your integrity.  As I, like many others, inevitably move on in these coming weeks and months, I will leave with mainly good memories, and of course, the regret that such an awesome organism like Enron could not survive forever.  My prayers and thoughts are with you as you work so hard at preserving our core businesses, and again, thank you for giving me the opportunity to have been a part of Enron.  I will always be proud to have worked under your direction and leadership.

  <content type="text" name="message">Mr. Ken Lay,
To explain further , I put $25,000.00 in Enron Capital Limited Life
company 8%PFD cumulative guaranteed monthly income preferred shares.
CUSIP# P37307108 bought 11-04-1993 in name of Sue Diviney Hester through
A.G Edwards acct. # 42-323-160. In reading the prospectus dated Oct. 25,
1993 page S14 under General , second paragraph . The entire principal
amount of the loan will become due and payable upon the date which Enron
is dissolved , wound up or liquidated or the date upon whichEnron Capital
is dissolved or liquidated. There is more that I won`t refer to at this
time . I do hope you can find a way to repay this debt under some of
these provisions , please give it your attention . I know this is small
stuff and you are busy but I need your help Mr. Lay . Maybe I can count
on you to find a way out for me so I can continue to be able to support
myself.

What about our medical benefits, can it possibly continue ? I have had
cancer as well as an uncurable lung diesese . I can not see any way I
will be accepted in other plans .

I am holding 200 shares in Northern Borders Partners LP unit partnership
interest since 9-23-1993 CUSIP 664785102 at First Chicago Trust . Acct
#8124-27264. It looks like it maybe holding its value now but will it be
effected by what ever happens to Enron ?

Enron was a great company, I was so proud of it. You made it that and you
can do it again if given half a chance. I Pray someone will put enough
confidence in it so it can remain a company to build on and become a lot
better than it was with out the selfish greed that has brought this on
us.

Thank you for reading my letter,
Sue D. Hester

I previously worked for Enron and have found employment elsewhere.  I really would like to put my son back into Enron Kids starting Monday, but I cannot afford $800 a month.  Do you know if the rates will be lowered?  I am a single mother and can only afford $650 - $680 a month.  Could you please get back with me as soon as possible?  I need to know if I am going to have to put him in another daycare.  
Thank you for your consideration.

  <content type="text" name="message">============================================================
Crossfire at 7:30 p.m. ET
On January 7, 2002
And online at CNN.com/CROSSFIRE
============================================================

From CNN's Crossfire Staff:

Tonight in the CROSSFIRE... the economy is on the front
burner in Washington and the finger pointing continues
between the two political parties about who is to blame
for the economic downturn. Has President Bush set himself
up to follow the mistakes of his father by declaring that
repeal of his tax cut would come only "over my dead body"?
Has the White House misrepresented Majority Leader
Daschle's proposals by suggesting he is in favor of a tax
increase? Should everything be on the table in trying to
tackle the nation's economic losses? Will the president
be able to translate his high approval numbers on the
war on terrorism to the domestic front or have the
Democrats found an avenue to political success in 2002?
Rep. Tom Davis (R-VA), Chairman of the Natl. Republican
Congressional Cmte. and Rep. Martin Frost (D-TX),
Chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, debate which
party has the best road map for economic recovery.

Then, this weekend a 15-year-old flight student piloted
a small plane into a Tampa office building in an apparent
suicide. Does this incident reveal major gaps in
monitoring general aviation? Should there be a crackdown
and greater regulation at flight schools or is that an
overreaction? Are small planes any more of a threat than
trucks or other vehicles? Could greater restrictions drive
small airports out of business? Mike Pangia, a flight
instructor and former FAA attorney argues that no added
regulations are necessary while former NTSB Managing
Director Peter Goelz says that additional oversight is
a must. They face off tonight.

Join Bill Press and Robert Novak tonight on Crossfire,
7:30pm eastern, 4:30 pacific. On CNN. You won't want to
miss our tale of which state is going to have four
governors in eight days.

  <content type="text" name="message">============================================================
Crossfire at 7:30 p.m. ET
On January 8, 2002
And online at CNN.com/CROSSFIRE
============================================================

From CNN's Crossfire Staff:

Tonight in the CROSSFIRE... the U.S. Justice Department
is putting top priority on tracking down 6,000
"deportable aliens" of Middle Eastern and Arab descent.
Is it racial profiling to target one ethnic group for
ejection? Shouldn't all aliens who have overstayed their
visas or violated rules be treated equally? Could this
measure help prevent future terrorist attacks, or is it
a violation of individual rights? After Sept. 11th and
given the common characteristics of the hijackers, is
it justified to apply added scrutiny to those who fit
the same profile? Former Deputy Attorney General George
Terwilliger argues that profiling may be necessary in
the war on terrorism while Wade Henderson of the
Leadership Council on Civil Rights says individuals
of certain backgrounds shouldn't be singled out by
law enforcement. It should make for a heated debate.

Join Bill Press and Robert Novak tonight on Crossfire,

Wolf Blitzer Reports: 5:00 &amp; 7:00 p.m. EST
Tuesday January 8, 2002
=================================================
The Value of a Life
=================================================
From CNN's Wolf Blitzer in Washington:

Despite his Democratic Party credentials, it was not a huge
surprise that President Bush and Attorney General John Ashcroft
appointed Ken Feinberg to take charge of one of the most
important and sensitive jobs in Washington. In late November,
Feinberg was tapped to distribute the billions of federal dollars
allocated to the families of those killed in the September 11
terrorist attacks. Feinberg is now the so-called Special Master
of the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund.

Just click here http://www.cnn.com/wolf to read my column
for more on Feinberg's tough job of assessing the value of
the lives lost in the September 11th attacks.

Today, on both editions of Wolf Blitzer Reports, we will take
look at the latest developments in the war against terrorism.
On our 5 PM (Eastern) program, I will speak with former Clinton
deputy national security adviser James Steinberg and former
Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs Karl Inderfurth.
I will also have a special interview with Democratic Senator
Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, who worked closely with
the president in getting the new education bill passed.

On our 7 PM War Room program, we will examine how
vulnerable the U.S. remains to terrorist strikes. Among my
guests: Gen. Wesley Clark; Los Angeles Times reporter Robin
Wright; and Republican Congressman Saxby Chambliss, who
chairs the homeland security subcommittee.

Please join us tonight and every weeknight at 5 &amp; 7 PM (EST).
Don't forget to answer my question of the day: With al Qaeda on
the run, how vulnerable do you feel? Just go to my website
http://www.cnn.com/wolf to let us know what you think.

Thanks.

Wolf Blitzer

Greenfield at Large: Weeknights, 11:00 p.m. ET
Tuesday, January 08, 2002
============================================================

Here's the view from the ground in Afghanistan:

"...in Afghanistan you need more than smart bombs to win
a war; you need cash. You need to pay fighters so they
won't loot, you need to buy food so they won't steal it
and you need to purchase gas for their 4-by-4's. Most
crucially, you need cash to entice enemy commanders and
soldiers to switch sides...The going rate last fall was
several thousand dollars for a midlevel commander and as
little as $30 a head for soldiers."

Here's another:

"'There was no al Qaeda group there,' Aji Akhter Jan said
of a U.S. airstrike Dec. 29 on a compound in eastern
Afghanistan. The Red Cross said the raid killed 52 people,
nearly half of them children. Jan, an elderly, but robust-
looking man who wears a black turban, Taliban-style, said
the Americans were misled by an informant with a grudge
against two extended families who lived there."

Those reports came from the New York Times and USA Today,
respectively. They paint a picture of a nation where
alliances have less to do with the Taliban and the
Northern Alliance, and more to do with the Montagues and
Capulets, or perhaps the Hatfields and the McCoys.

Just this week, the 14-year-old suspected of shooting
Sgt. First Class Nathan Chapman has somehow disappeared
from the custody of the Afghan elders holding him.
Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar similarly seem to have
evaporated after Afghan forces reported having them
surrounded.

Can the U.S. trust its supposed allies there? And if
not, how can the U.S. military safely proceed in its
search for remaining al Qaeda pockets? Perhaps more
worrisome, how can stability take hold in an
environment where warring factions need chaos to
thrive?

Tonight, we'll hear from the reporters of those
stories, Peter Maass of the New York Times and
Steven Komarow of USA Today, as well as CNN Military
Analyst Gen. Wesley Clark (Ret.). We hope you'll
join us.

  <content type="text" name="message">============================================================
Crossfire at 7:30 p.m. ET
On January 9, 2002
And online at CNN.com/CROSSFIRE
============================================================

From CNN's Crossfire Staff:

Tonight in the CROSSFIRE... After a U.S. congressman is
asked to drop his trousers and a young Muslim woman has
to remove her head scarf, some are asking if airport
security has gone too far. Is security screening going
overboard, or are these measures necessary to prevent
future terrorist attacks? Should more sensitivity be
applied to religious practices, or should everyone expect
to be subjected to extensive searches? What is the best
way to keep the skies safe and not violate passengers'
rights? We are joined by Enaas Sarsour, the young lady
asked to remove her head scarf at the Baltimore airport
last month, and then, two security experts debate whether
the added barriers are equating to increased safety
in the air.

Then, Robert Reich announced his candidacy for
Massachusetts governor today and joins many of his former
Clinton administration cabinet members in running for
public office. Will they be running on the record of their
former boss or running away from it? Can Former Attorney
General Janet Reno and Former Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson escape the controversies that dogged them in
office and become governors of their home states? Former
Clinton White House Spokesman Joe Lockhart and top
Republican Strategist Charlie Black join us to discuss
the candidates prospects.

Join Bill Press and Tucker Carlson tonight on Crossfire,
7:30pm eastern, 4:30 pacific. On CNN. You won't want to
miss what the hosts have to say about Vice President
Cheney's continued hibernation.

on Wednesday, January 9, 2002
============================================================
From Wolf Blitzer Reports
============================================================
Wolf Blitzer Reports Wednesday
============================================================
Today, on both editions of Wolf Blitzer Reports, we will
have the latest developments in the war in Afghanistan.
As you may have heard, a United States Marine Corps
aerial refueling plane crashed today in Pakistan. We
will have all the latest details from our reporters on
the scene and at the Pentagon.

   During our 5 PM (EST) program, I will get analysis
from retired U.S. Air Force Major General Don Shepperd
and the former Clinton national security adviser,
Samuel Berger. I will also speak with Congressman
Darrell Issa of California. It was in his district
where authorities discovered an employee at a nuclear
facility had lots of guns and ammunition in his home.
How vulnerable are America's nuclear facilities?
I will ask Issa.

   On our 7 PM (EST) War Room program, we will assess the
state of the military campaign with three guests:
Rep. Porter Goss, chairman of the House Intelligence
Committee; Paul Bremer, the former U.S. ambassador at
large for counter-terrorism; and Robert Oakley, the
former U.S. ambassador to Pakistan.

And just click on http://www.CNN.com/Wolf to read my
column: "Bush and Kennedy: The Ultimate Odd Couple."

   Please join me today and every weekday at both 5 and
7 PM (EST).

   Thanks.

   Wolf Blitzer

  <content type="text" name="message">============================================================
Greenfield at Large: Weeknights, 11:00 p.m. ET
Wednesday, January 09, 2002
============================================================

We're dealing today with the possible returns of two
phenomena that may cause some folks to lose sleep --
anthrax and politics.

Which is worse we'll leave for you to decide.

There's no indication that a bioterror attack is under
way or about to be. Instead, we're focusing tonight on
what happens IF it is. Is the U.S. any better prepared
now than it was in October? What happened to all the talk
about ensuring that communities are ready to respond? Has
the money been allocated? Plans formulated? We'll ask one
of the top advisors to Homeland Security chief Tom Ridge,
Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health.

Then there's politics. The November elections and the
ailing economy have -- despite September 11's aftermath of
unity -- led to both parties sharpening their rhetorical
swords. And they're starting to get pulled from their
sheaths more often. This past weekend President Bush and
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle took aim at each other.

Is this what the country needs right now? Or is it a
healthy sign of a return to the normal give-and-take of
America's political system? We'll debate these questions
tonight with Susan Page of USA Today, Slate.com's Jacob
Weisberg and CNN Contributor Jonah Goldberg. We hope
you'll join us, no matter what party you belong to.

(Note: Our guests and topic are subject to change.)

Dear Mr. Lay:
Please find the attachment of the NXE Energy Executive Summary Report prepared by Dr. M. X. Francois, The Director of the Fluid Mechanics Laboratory of the French National Scientific Research Agency (CNRS). The Submission of this and all other information is of course confidential.
The report combined with conversation's held with Dr. Francois recommends that because of the success of the "Alpha" Prototype testing we should proceed with an Industrial "Beta" model with certain modification's to the circuit piping system design, and insert a turbine and generator after completing sizing and a designed computer model.
Again wishing you and Enron the best,

  <content name="title" action="cluster">Half truths</content>
  <content type="text" name="message">Mr. Lay

We are getting blasted in the news and a lot of the information is false. There is NO one there to tell the complete truth.  Americans are getting the news that the media wants them to hear and it is not the full truth. Don't we need a spokesman to counter the lies? 

In the end even if there were no wrong doing, it won't matter because the media (and politicians) have said the same lies over and over and finally Americans believe it no matter if it is the truth or not. Day after day they have people on who say, "I heard that Enron has fired 20,000 employees".  They never have someone on that really knows.  And, "Enron benefited from 17 provisions in this law".  WELL - - so did Dynegy, and Williams and El Paso and on and on.  And, "Enron only paid taxes one out of five years".  WELL - - how many large companies did the same?  And, "Ken Lay called O'Neil".  WELL - - how many CEO's of large companies called him?  No one is there to represent Enron.  Enron has done things wrong, but it doesn't help if no one is there to stop the half truths and flat out lies. 

Please allow someone who has the knowledge and skills to go on TV and tell both sides. 
Thanks. Cecil</content>

  <content type="text" name="message">Dad,
I know this has been more difficult than I can conceive, so I did what every
good seminary student should and looked for something that might help a
little.  Solomon, when he was made king, asked only for wisdom and God gave
it to him as well as many other blessings.  The wisdom, as you well know,
helped him to be a great ruler.  There is no doubt God has already given you
great wisdom and will continue to bless your life.

You are always in my prayers.

Love,
Mark


5 In Gibeon Jehovah appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said,
Ask what I shall give thee.
6 And Solomon said, Thou hast showed unto thy servant David my father great
lovingkindness, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in
righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for
him this great lovingkindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his
throne, as it is this day.
7 And now, O Jehovah my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of
David my father: and I am but a little child; I know not how to go out or
come in.
8 And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a
great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.
9 Give thy servant therefore an understanding heart to judge thy people,
that I may discern between good and evil; for who is able to judge this thy
great people?
  1 Kings 3:5-9 (ASV)

29 And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and
largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea-shore.
30 And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east,
and all the wisdom of Egypt.
  1 Kings 4:29-30 (ASV)

Aside from ENE stock price, I trust all is well with you and your
familyand that you, like us, were all relatively unaffected by Sep
11.  We are fortunate to have work and other commitments to keep us busy

so that we don't have time to worry too much about anthrax, etc.  Our
base technology merger and acquisition business has remained steady this

year and we are now seeing increased activity again.  Our "B2B" semi
spare parts supply chain integration company, netMercury, has weathered
the downturn, with most of its competitors out of business now, and its
future looks bright.

I am starting a small venture capital fund to take advantage of great
investment opportunities in semiconductor and optical processing
technologies.

I am now commuting from Sonoma most days and I do think about terrorism
every time I cross the golden gate bridge--what a spectacular event an
attack on it would be!  I am reading the daily obituaries in the NYTimes

of the "best and brightest" that were lost in the World Trade Center so
that I can try to personalize and share, just a little, of what happened

and I have to admit that reading them gets me down some days.   I feel
now that we must achieve something very great and long-lasting in this
battle as a memorial to those who have been lost. And I believe that if
we project our power very strongly and determinedly, as is being done at

present, we can bring resolution, clarity and better balance to many
trouble spots around the world and that we can--and must--make the world

better for the next generation of Arab peoples and Islamic believers
everywhere.  I am so proud of our system and the way that both parties,
for the most part, are cooperating in these challenging times.

I believe that we must take steps to educate our next generation about
Islam and find a way indirectly to educate the next generation in the
Middle East especially about how Islam  (at least the moderate
interpretations of the Koran) can thrive in our inclusive Western
culture.  I am re-reading Seven Pillars of Wisdom (T.E. Lawrence) and
find the first chapter on the history of the Semitic people, the Arab
tribes and Islam to be especially topical just now.  Even bought a
two-volume set of the Koran and a book on Islamic Art, to try to
understand better the situation we will be in for a few years now, if
not the next generation.

Although we still have the SF house, our main address now is 19400 Wyatt

Road, Sonoma 95476, where we have our guest house completed and extra
bedrooms in the main house, just waiting for the Lay family to come
visit the wine country!!  I miss our past times together and look
forward to an opportunity to visit in person with you one of
these days.  We are preparing for a thanksgiving here in the country
with all the children home, together, which will be even more special
this year after all that has happened.  Polly doing great, retired as a
first grade teacher this Summer, now a volunteer ESL teacher at local
Sonoma non-profit (La Luz),helping the immigrant Mexican families cope
with their life here (Polly's effort was featured in a front page
article in the local paper!!).

We are off to parents' weekend in Tucson. Best (the very best) regards,
Gary and Polly

  <content type="text" name="message">Dear Mr. Lay ---

As a recently terminated employee of Enron, I have watched the stock's
dramatic tumble in the last weeks mount on top of the horrible performance
over the last months.  As Chairman and CEO, you are ultimately responsible
for everything that goes on in the company.  Without getting into the
potentially criminal and certainly ill-conceived activities of you and other
Enron executives, past and present, I think you have done little but pay lip
service in order to correct things.

Mr. Lay, you and the other executives receive very large salaries.  None of
you is hurting for money.  I think it unconscionable that you and other
executives continue to draw a paycheck.  While employees and others like me
have seen our net worth go from respectable sums to zero, you remain wealthy
beyond most of our dreams.  What's worse, you take more from the company
every week in the form of pay.  I realize you haven't had a soul in quite
sometime.  But are you so unconcerned with the well-being of the people like
me who believed in you and worked years and years for you, that you feel
justified adding insult to injury?  You have literally ruined the lives of
thousands of people.  Your employees deserve better than this!  I was
terminated at mid-year because my book was losing $2 million.  That's right,
$2 million!  That's after I'd made tens of millions for you over the past
eight years.  You and yours have lost me more than that of my own personal
money now.  I don't quite know how to fire you.

It's obvious that neither you nor any other executive currently in power at
Enron have any credibility whatsoever.  Cutting off difficult questions on a
conference call or ignoring pointed questions from employees don't go along
way in restoring any credibility or respect.  There is none left, and yet
you continue to take money out of the Enron coffers for yourself in the form
of compensation.  The hubris there is so incredible to me that it defies
comprehension.

Why, exactly, is Enron paying you?  Do you feel justified being paid by
Enron?  Do you feel justified seeing Enron pay large sums of money to others
involved while those of us with our retirement and childrens' education
funds tied up in Enron suffer more?

I worked at Enron from May of 1993 until this month.  I watched my net worth
increase substantially with my hard work at Enron.  Now, in the blink of an
eye, my net worth has plummeted to levels I haven't experienced since long
before I went to work at Enron.  I worked there for nearly nine years and
now have nothing to show for it.  Well, that's not entirely true.  I have
learned a valuable lesson.  I will never put my faith in someone again like
I did in you.  I now know that you couldn't care less about the well-being
of your employees.  You do still, however, show an incredible capacity for
greed.  You continue to rob the company of funds that could be going to more
useful places.

As I said, I was terminated because my book had $2 million in losses YTD
based on a couple of bad trades and some bad positions I inherited.  In this
pay-for-performance world, where does that leave you?  You continue to
enrich yourself while losing billions of dollars every single day.  I
imagine the PRC would have looked poorly on me if I lost 10-30% of the
company's value each day the market was open.

I no longer work for Enron, but I am left holding the bag with a ton of
worthless options and shares in my 401(k).  I only have a short time in
which to exercise those options.  I don't have the luxury of waiting for
enough good news to come out of the company to make them valuable.  I'm just
one of the thousands upon thousands of financial lives you've ruined.  The
very people that have made you rich you have made poor.  And somehow, you
seem to smile as you keep doing it!

I'd like your response as to why you feel it necessary for you and notable
others to continue to take money from the rest of us in the form of a
paycheck.  Please write me back.

Sincerely,


Scott Hendrickson

Dear Phyllis,

Bless you for your care and concern.  I have forwarded on to Ken's office
and will get him to Aspen as soon as the smoke clears.  He is burning the
candle day and night with very little sleep.  I am praying hard for him and
Enron and know that he has the strength, wisdom, skills and courage to
persevere and succeed.

I will stay in touch.

Love, Linda

Dear Linda,
So much for your quieter time of life.
After seeing the NY Times article yesterday, I am glad for Enron that
Ken is back at the helm; I trust he will persevere and be more than
successful in whatever he does.
I am concerned about his level of stress, and would highly recommend
that he keep up that anxiety control formula, taking two after meals
3x a day. I have stronger things in my arsenal if needed.
Also, perhaps when he is here sometime, I could check his blood
chemistry for stress factors and optimal brain function.
Warmest Regards,
Phyllis

This is an amazing letter and I am so happy that Mr. White stands behind us! 

I was born and raised in Houston and worked in Houston through the good times and the bad. I agree wholeheartedly with his article and trust that our company is working hard to make things right. Whether I am laid off or allowed to stay this year, I will always stand behind this company!  I worked 10 years at HL&amp;P as an electrical field engineer from 1977 to 1987--through gas lines and recessions and all kinds of internal problems. I know what it's like to feel belittled because the media makes such a ruckus about company policies that we had to paint over the HL&amp;P bullet logo on our company cars and say that we worked for Houston Industries, not Houston Lighting and Power. Shoot, I even had to face a double-barrel shotgun because I had on a company uniform with HL&amp;P on it!  Well, we made it through it and now HL&amp;P is Reliant Energy, so restoration is always possible. I worked side-by-side with those committed Enron employees (most I had never met) helping to clean mud-laden homes from the tropical storm this year, and I was so proud to say to my friends that Enron allowed it's employees to be a part of the community clean-up. My daughter is a senior who volunteered her time during Earth Day festivities here and met other young, innovative people who became her new friends. I want her to keep this positive attitude about our company. I've worked for DuPont, Xerox and Baroid, MCI and Worldcom, and Lyondell and other corporate giants in the past 10 years. Not one ever offered the kind of monetary help (not to mention excellent benefits and raises) that Enron always provides. 

I just want to say, Ken, keep up the good work!  I'm proud to be an Enron employee, and yes, even an EBS employee!!

Linda Faircloth

Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  &lt;http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (&lt;http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you.</content>

Happy to meet and explain this. Exempt versus non-exempt is more a legal interpretation of what roles at Enron qualify to fall into each of these separate classification. Each has some fairly strict criteria and of course, in so far as why there is a distinction, frequency of pay, applicability overtime and a number of other aspects hinge on which of these applies.

Valeria Hope, Ryan Seleznov and Michelle Cash are greater experts in all aspects of the above, but as I mentioned I would be happy to meet with you to discuss.

Mr. Oxley, as head of Human Resources for Enron North America, I would really appreciate your assistance.  I have met with various HR reps during my nearly eight-year tenure with Enron to understand the qualifications required for an administrative assistant to move into an exempt role.  From those meetings, however, I received severely conflicting information and left with a feeling that there are no rules, or that the rules are made and changed from person to person.  That being said, does HR follow a set of rules that are standard for all non-exempt promotions to exempt roles?  In addition, are qualifications to meet those standards changed with each individual?  Your assistance would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.

  <content type="text" name="message">Dear Mr. Lay,

I know that you are a very busy man and really don't have time to read messages from your employees, but I just had to write you of my thought and feelings.

I haven't been sleeping very well because I am heartbroken at what is happening to this wonderful company.  I really try to be positive about the outcome of it all, but the news seem to get worse and worse.  I am so worried about all of the lives that are being affected and what it's going to mean to all of us in the coming months. Also, as someone who only has a few years left before retirement, I am faced with the possibility that I will not have any supplemental retirement to help me live in a decent environment.  

I love Enron and all that it has made it great and will continue to work hard to make a contribution to its success.  However, I realize that it ultimately is up to you and your team to successfully resolve all the issues facing our company.   I have the faith that you can do that.

Mr. Lay, please allow me to be bold and ask you to  remember that "God is Always in Control" and he will help if only we ask him to.

Thank you so much for your time.

Subject:	2001 Management Conference


During this critical time, it is imperative that our management team remain focused on our business and continue to address the challenges currently facing our company.  For that reason, I have decided to postpone the Enron Management Conference.

The Conference will now be held Friday, February 22 - Saturday, February 23, 2002 at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the Saturday meeting allows some Enron executives who cannot be away from the office during business hours to attend the Management Conference for the first time, I also recognize that it requires many of you to forfeit additional personal time on behalf of Enron.  I truly appreciate your sacrifice and I sincerely encourage your attendance.

The new agenda, while still being finalized, will be abbreviated but every bit as informative and worthwhile as previously planned.  We'll be in touch soon with more details.

Regards,
Ken Lay </content>

I do not know if this email will find your eyes or not....

  I just wanted to tell you, as a shareholder,
  since we are in a difficult time period,
  to PLEASE continue to keep your chin-up,
  and look at this "storm" as a time
  to be strong and use your courage to make the tough
  decisions to keep Enron afloat...and utilizing
  all your strength and prayers...you will
  be able to lead ENRON to safe harbors once again.

   Do not let the negative media effect you, please
   keep pushing forward, and you will be successful.

   This adversity will prepare you and strengthen
   you for the "perfect storm" we will run into
   throughout our existence...


   Thanks for listening...

   PS Back in during the Econmic Summit here in
      Houston, you met my daughter Sophia, and she
      wrote to you, and you took the time to write
      her back about 11 years old...
      well now she is 21 and a
      major in PR/Communications at BYU in Provo, UT,
      and on November 20th at 3:00 PM she has decided
      to marry to Jacob Little in Utah..
