  <content type="text" name="message">Dear Messer's Skilling and Lay,

I heard a song with the lyrics "how can I say thanks for all the things you've done for me", I'm pretty sure it's by Andre Crouch.  Let me thank you for the help and loving kindness you and ENRON has shown to me during the period after the devasting floods.  I've never worked for such a wonderful company before, the people here in every walk of life are so very friendly.  The scriptures speaks of drawing people toward you with loving kindness, and you certainly have here at ENRON.  The people that i've met here want to be here and that's a good sign.  One morning on the elevator a lady was singing on the way to her floor, i didn't recognize the tune right away, probably because it was early morning, the tune turned out to be "OKLAHOMA" so I joined her, she invited me to come and be a part of the ENRON CHOIR.  Just  the other day you Mr. Skilling passed my desk and asked had my group just moved to the 31st floor, i've only been here at ENRON since January '01 and wasn't aware that my group had moved from the 29th floor.  My Grandmother always used to tell me as a child, "you better keep a thought in mind, that someones watching you, and they want to be just like you, setting their examples by you, and they're never gonna miss a single thing you do.  And I live by that today.  Well I can be a little longwinded,  but remember:

If I can help somebody  as I pass along,
If I can cheer somebody with a word or song,
If I can can show somebody that he's traveling wrong,
Then my living shall not be in vain.

And you both have certainly obeyed that dictum.


God Bless You Both,

  <content type="text" name="message">Dear Mr. Lay &amp; Mr. Skilling,

I cannot begin to express my gratitude to you and Enron for the $1000.00 I received.  My husband and I were devastated when our home flooded.  I was so proud to be an Enron employee when I heard that we had donated $500,000 to the flood relief fund.  But when I learned that we would be eligible for $1000 as flood victims, I could only burst into tears and thank God for working for such a humanitarian company.  I was a participant in the Fortune 500 survey last year and rated Enron as THE best place to work for! I truly believed it then and even more so now.  Thank you again for going above and beyond this employees' expectations.  We are truly grateful.

  <content type="text" name="message">Jeff and Christie:

It was a pleasure having you here on campus.  Let me add my thanks to those
of the Entrepreneurial Manager faculty who actually taught the case.  I
think your presence added enormously to the success of the maiden voyage of
this case.

As I indicated to you, I want to make the case even stronger by
incorporating any additional data or suggestions that you may have after
seeing it taught.  Jeff, you indicated you had a couple of quick
corrections, and I'd appreciate receiving those.  Also if you have any
thoughts about how we might enrich the case, those would be welcome
too.  Christie, as indicated in our discussions, I think some sense of the
economics of Enron Online would be enormously helpful.  Even if we have to
use disguised data, can we break out the sales and profitability of the
trading operations before the launch of Enron Online.  With some indication
of what the new Internet-based model will do to margins, students can do
some simple calculations of the volume necessary to compensate, and
therefore have some idea of the enormously ambitious (and significantly
risky) venture that this turned out to be.  I will gladly talk further
about this with you directly or with whomever you want to put me in touch
with.  Let me emphasize that the data do not have to be actual data--we can
use disguised information that multiplies all the real data by a factor,
for example.

Thanks again for your incredible support through the development of this
material and its delivery.  I think it was a great success.

Regards,
Chris

P.S.  I am just looking at the beta version of the multimedia cases on
Enron's Transformation and Enron Online. These should be ready within a
couple of weeks and will allow students to read the case and click on
images of Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling, and Louise Kitchen as they talk about the
issues raised in the case. This should help students come to class with an
even richer understanding of the culture, values, and personal style of the
key players.</content>

  <content type="text" name="message">Mr. Skilling,

Rev. Lawson would like to thank you for extending to him the invitation to
participate in the 2001 Big Cats Gala on June 14, 2001 at the Bronx Zoo in
New York.  Unfortunately, he will not be able to attend the event, and the
Wheeler Avenue budget for this year is not such that we can comfortably make
a contribution.  He would like to convey to Mr. Lay, however, that he
rejoices with this esteemed honor and will continue to keep his friend in
his prayers.

Thank you,

  <content name="title" action="cluster">Re: Clinton Energy Vacation Policy &amp; Request</content>
  <content type="text" name="message">I was disappointed,  to say the least, at the return email I received from you so I waited before replying so as not to react in haste. Previously I stuck to facts and did not bring things of a personal nature into the equation. I feel, however, that there are a few things you should know about me and how I have exemplified the ENRON VISION so you can realize why I took this so seriously and why am, to be blunt, ticked off at the resolution.
In the 4 years that I worked on the scheduling desk for Clinton I never missed a day of work.........not one.
I never took vacation during bid week or during tie out time.
Between 96 - 00 I took all but 3 days vacation between the months of May - October so as not to interfere with winter gas operations.
I have had nothing but above average reviews in the past 5 years,  been promoted twice, and received special recognition for working shorthanded through the winter of 99-00.
As you can see I have consistently put ENRON ahead of personal conveniences and strived to do the right thing for the company. I am distressed that the very values Enron holds me to ring hollow with regards to how I have been treated.
Changing vacation rules, be it legally legitimate, does not exemplify INTEGRITYin my eyes!
Not stating a policy change (THERE HAS STILL NEVER BEEN A FORMAL STATEMENT OF THIS CHANGE) does not illustrate COMMUNICATION!
Stating that I will be paid for vacation less any I take between now and the severance date is deceptive at the least and would not constitute RESPECT, EXCELLENCE nor INTEGRITY!
FACT - items 1 - 6 in the original email are 100% true. #2 is of the most significance as the words came from the lips of our HR representative that I would be paid the vacation amount we discussed UNLESS I TOOK ANY VACATION BETWEEN NOW AND JUNE 1st.
FACT - At least 2 people were allowed vacation time off during this transition (Susan Weison, Sheri Wallace)
FACT - If you check my vacation records you will find that I have taken a vacation EVERY YEAR IN MAY. My request was made, like in all previous years, a few weeks before I wanted to take it. HAD I KNOWN THAT THE RULES OF THE GAME WERE GOING TO BE CHANGED I WOULD HAVE MADE MY INTENTIONS KNOWN EARLIER.

In conclusion I do not expect, or even wish for a response. I have enjoyed my time with Clinton Energy and Enron. I have learned much and forwarded my career greatly and for that I am thankful. I just wanted you to know where I am coming from and how an unfortunate situation of severance was turned into one in which I leave being taught a lesson by Enron that does not make me a better person, just a smarter one. This lesson; a spotless record &amp; loyalty to a company means very little. It is better to look out for #1. In the end the company you work for is going to protect their best interests regardless of the rhetoric in their Vision Statement. Thank you for your time.

Respectfully,

Sean Zurbrick

Subject:	Re: Clinton Energy Vacation Policy &amp; Request   

Sean;

Thank you for bringing your concerns to us.  We value the input of our employees, and constantly seek ways to improve the quality of our employee benefits.  After talking to some of the parties involved in this matter and reviewing our vacation policy, we find that your management acted within the scope of its responsibility and within the bounds of our vacation policy.  In addition, we find no evidence of inconsistencies and believe that you and your co-workers at Clinton have been treated equitably and fairly regarding the denial of vacation during this transition period. 

In closing, we support the decision to deny vacation requests to the Clinton employees affected by this transition.  Should you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to direct them to your management

Subject:	Clinton Energy Vacation Policy &amp; Request

I have held discussions with Tim Weithman, Ashley Kerr &amp; Ken Brooks (immediate supervisor) regarding a request for vacation for the 3rd or 4th week in May. I have been told recently by both Ms. Kerr as well as Mr. Weithman that those of us being severed from the company are not permitted to take any vacation time between now and June 1st. It would seem that there are several inconsistencies regarding Enron policy as well as how the subject was presented both to the group as well as individually. Below are the inconsistencies I speak of.

During the group meeting in the beginning of April there was no mention of "vacation freezes". The only reference to time that was mentioned was that you must be employed by Enron as of June 1, 2001 to receive the severance package.
During my private discussion, in which both Ms. Kerr and Ms. Gray were present, I was presented with the specifics of the severance package. I specifically remember being asked for my current unused vacation amount. I gave them the amount of 152 hours and was told that I would be reimbursed for that total unless, of course, I took any additional vacation. This implied that regular Enron vacation policies would be in effect. Again, at no time was it presented to me that I was ineligible to take ANY of my earned vacation or that there would be any deviations from normal Enron policy regarding vacation.
At no time has Mr. Weithman, Ms. Gray, Ms. Kerr or any other Enron agent made public a policy of vacation freezes.
At no time were there ever any public or private requests that the plans for those with previously scheduled vacations to be made available to any Enron agent.
I can find nothing in my severance package that states any deviation from the standard Enron vacation policy.
I realize that Enron policy requires vacation approval from the supervising employee. It states in that policy the following:
"An employee's preference for scheduling vacation should be adopted when possible."
"The supervisor must verify that unit staffing needs are met before approving an employee's vacation request."
I am currently still an Enron employee.  I have also verified that staffing needs are met. 

In summary, as you can see there are several inconsistencies with regards to the vacation policy for those being severed at Clinton Energy. It more than offends me that I am being prohibited from taken ANY part of the 152 hours of accrued vacation that is, by all accounts, mine to take. This being said, I am formally requesting one last time that I be granted my vacation request during the month of May. Furthermore I would like this approval as soon as possible so that I may make necessary arrangements. As you review this I am consulting an attorney so that I may be advised of my rights regarding this matter.

Thank you,

Sean Zurbrick

California; Metro Desk
Electricity Cost Data Spread the Blame Power: Many suppliers charged more
than the firms that Davis has pilloried, records show.

SACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more diverse
group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray Davis,
who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records
show.


During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretches of
power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and private
entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid
to Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by
the Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California.


Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per
megawatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San Diego Gas
& Electric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power, the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a
megawatt-hour charged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC
Hydro, to $292 an hour by the DWP.


In fact, some of the biggest private power companies singled out for
criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc., Duke Energy and
Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid for the period.
Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 per megawatt-hour,
according to an analysis of the documents.


The figures cover the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased
by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more
than a month of razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power
emergencies.


Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest
barbs at private out-of-state generators because, in general, they have
reaped the highest profits over the longest period.


"You have to look at the whole picture," Maviglio said.


"The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the
generators who wear cowboy hats," he said. "Their profits were 100% to 400%
above last year. . . . Just because there are other entities who are
charging us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact that we are
getting ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte."


The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times
on the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on California's
electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year's first
quarter.


The records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion buying power in
the first five months of the year, and underscore the complexity of the
state's energy problem. They also show that patterns of high prices are not
limited to a few generators.


Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the water resources agency, said that the
reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the
year. "All the prices were high," he said, noting the downward trend in
costs since his agency began buying power in mid-January.


The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purchases went from $316
in January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an average of $321 per
hour to $271, the reports show.


In the first quarter of the year, some public entities' prices far exceeded
those of the biggest private companies. For example, Houston-based Enron,
one of the nation's biggest power traders, charged an average of $181 per
megawatt-hour. And Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold the most to the state,
a total of $706 million, charged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour.


By contrast, a Calgary, Canada, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a
megawatt-hour, and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average
charges of $330 per megawatt-hour.


A spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said recently that the "vilification of
Enron was based on politics, not facts." Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not
be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the
past, the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered
last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on.


A spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric,
said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to
see the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be
reached Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of
producing the power needed by the state were extremely high.


More Power Bought Than Projected


Hidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agency's efforts,
coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas
prices, have begun to tame the state's market.


Still, the state had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May,
about 10% more than Davis' analysts had projected.


Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply
problems in April. He said reports will show that power purchases fell
short of state projections in June and early July.


The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June
and July, partly because spot prices have fallen sharply, often to well
under $100 a megawatt-hour.


A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday credited
Davis' program of nurturing new power generation and establishing long-term
power contracts with with "moving the California electric energy industry
closer to normalcy."

  <content type="text" name="message">POWER POINTS: Skilling Moves On To Charities, Family
   By Mark Golden
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Jeff Skilling will be spending the next few years
working with charities in Houston and spending time with family, the former
chief executive of Enron Corp. (ENE) said in an interview.
  The 47-year-old Skilling, who resigned abruptly from Enron after the
company's
board meeting Aug. 14, repeatedly said he had left - as stated - for
personal
reasons. Wall Street has been skeptical of the explanation, and several
analysts
have said they're waiting for "the other shoe to drop." The company's stock
price fell 14% in response to the announcement last week - a loss of about
$4.5
billion in shareholder value - and hasn't recovered this week.
  But the former chief executive said the stock price will recover once
investors see that his departure isn't a precursor to more bad news for the
company.
  "I've spent the last 34 years working really hard," said Skilling, who
requested the interview with Dow Jones Newswires. "There are a lot of things
that I haven't been doing - personal interests, spending time with family.
There
are a number of charitable things that I haven't spent the time on that I
believe I should. I don't mean fundraising, but hands on, getting out and
doing
things, building houses, helping individuals."
  Skilling, who has been involved with a multiple sclerosis charity for
years,
said he plans to get involved in promoting the City of Houston.
  "It's massively underrated as a place to work and live," he said. "It's a
great city, and I think I can do a lot to get that across."
  Though insistent that there is nothing more to his departure than personal
reasons, Skilling said little to reveal why a talented executive would
surrender
the top spot of the country's largest energy trading company just six months
after taking the job. Skilling had been Enron's No. 2 executive from 1997
until
this year, and he's generally credited with the success of Enron's wholesale
trading operations, which comprise about 80% of the parent's earnings.
  He confirmed there's no crisis in his family, and his health is fine.
Skilling, who assumed the chief executive title on Feb. 12, also denied that
he
was suffering under the strain of the job.
  Late last week, Chairman Kenneth Lay and other Enron executives in New
York
told Wall Street analysts that Skilling had been going "kind of nuts" under
the
pressure of being chief executive, one analyst said.
  "It's not true that I was cracking up," he said. "Do I sound like someone
who
is cracking up? The representation of me as thick-skinned is a reasonable
representation."
  When asked if his departure could have been handled more smoothly so as
not to
alarm investors, Skilling said that perhaps the mechanics could have been
better, but said that is hindsight.
  "We thought it through and thought we were going about it in the right
way,"
he said. "I don't know what we could have done differently. It will turn
out, in
retrospect, fine, as soon as people see that there's nothing else."

   About One Week's Notice

  The former chief executive totally disagreed with speculation in this
column
last week that Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay, who immediately resumed the role
of
chief executive, may have wanted to regain day-to-day control of the company
and
pushed Skilling out.
  "I think the world of Ken. You can't find a bigger fan of his than me," he
said. "I was not forced out. Personal and family reasons are 100% of the
story.
I guess it's kind of mundane, and I'm sorry it doesn't have as much drama
and
suspense as a lot of people would like it to have, but that's what the deal
is."
  Skilling said he spoke with Lay about wanting to do other things many
times
over the years. The first serious discussion of his imminent departure came
about a week before the announcement, said Skilling, whose recollection of
his
giving notice to Lay was somewhat cloudy.
  "The board knew what was going on, and that was the point (the Aug. 14
board
meeting) where the decisions were going to be made," he said.
  The decisions?
  "I guess to accept my resignation," Skilling said.
  Enron refused to release a copy of the minutes of the Aug. 14 board
meeting,
which was regularly scheduled. The company doesn't generally release
board-meeting minutes, spokeswoman Karen Denne said.
  The former chief executive continues to work as a paid adviser to Enron. A
clause in his contract prevents him from competing with the company through
the
end of 2003, and he has no plans to work outside the energy industry.
  That might sound like a big comedown from running the country's most
aggressive energy company, but Skilling said the move fits.
  "Some people say 'Well, you were working and aspiring so long to become
CEO of
Enron.' That's not true. I was working to build a business, and we did,"
said
Skilling, who is credited with transforming the company into a trading
powerhouse.
  "The company I built is doing great. My life is moving on."
  He also said the company will do fine without him. Some analysts have
expressed concern about Enron's ability to retain its top talent. Skilling's
predecessor as Enron's No. 2 executive, Richard Kinder, for example, left
the
company in 1996 after Lay announced that he would be retaining the chief
executive spot for another five years. Kinder went on to buy Enron's small
liquids pipeline business and turned that company into Kinder-Morgan Inc.
(KMI).
  Enron's current management, Skilling said, has a "very deep bench." For
example, he described Enron Energy Services Chief Executive Dave Delaney as
"awesome."
  "Dave created the Canadian business in Enron," Skilling said.

Mr. Kenneth Lay
Chairman
Enron Corporation
1440 Smith Street
Houston, Texas 77002

Dear Mr. Kenneth Lay:

This brief note concerns an innovative business development opportunity in
the rapidly expanding field of B2B eProcurement/e-commerce.  I am trying to
initiate a system to fully integrate an industry that is fragmented and in
need of adding scalable 'process' efficiencies.  This will require
substantial resources that are not available to me. These resources would be
less significant to a company like Enron Corporation.  However the upside
potential would, I believe, be significant to your corporation. The risk
reward ratio in this marketplace favors the upside potential significantly.
This market is ripe for innovation because of the fundamental need to
improve product and service delivery in a cost effective and timely manner.
The process has already begun but will require a critical mass player that
can deliver open-market eProcurement.  The process related savings alone
will be approximately $11 billion annual when an effective supply chain
system is implemented. The timing is critical since in the next 18- 36
months the winners and losers would have already lined up for success and
failure.  A linchpin is needed and it could well be Enron.  I have little
doubt that Enron could do the job and become the stand-alone leader in this
field.

I am writing to Enron Corporation to determine your potential interest in a
very large global marketplace that is poised for transformation and
transition.  This marketplace is currently valued in excess of $300 billion
annual worldwide with high profit margins as well as large continuing
revenue growth rates in excess of 10% annually. There are buy and sell side
opportunities for revenues as well as a transactional fee opportunity.

What I am proposing would be the critical next innovative step to enter a
new level of global sourcing, purchasing, risk management and distribution
for this industry.

I realize the vagueness and brevity of my comments but without an existing
level of confidentiality I cannot expand these thoughts.  If you have
interest in taking one additional step to determine if my strategic concept
has merit please let me know.

Best regards,

John Manfredonia

Over the past few months, Enron Global Finance has been evaluating various opportunities where Enron and Smith Graham &amp; Company may be able to work together.  Unfortunately, the process was slowed when our primary contact at Smith Graham, Gabriel Hayes, left the firm earlier this year.  We have since reestablished discussions and the Global Finance Group is preparing a proposal that a portion (about $30 million) of the Enron Cash Balance Plan portfolio be dedicated to an emerging managers portfolio.  One-third of this money ($10 million) would be invested in bonds, which could be placed with Smith Graham, as the fixed-income manager .  (Total Plan assets are about $235 million.)

The proposal will be submitted to the Plan Administrative Committee at its quarterly meeting on May 3rd.  The proposal should be well received as the Committiee has previously requested that  we optimize our existing allocation to minority money managers.  Gerald Smith has been advised that Enron is looking at ways to allocate money to the firm, and that a decision should be reached sometime in May.  We have not communicated the specific details of our intentions as of yet pending the outcome of the May 3rd meeting.

I am available for further discussion at your convenience.

Regards,
Tim DeSpain

  <content type="text" name="message">
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

  <content type="text" name="message">Over the past few months, Enron Global Finance has been evaluating various opportunities where Enron and Smith Graham &amp; Company may be able to work together.  Unfortunately, the process was slowed when our primary contact at Smith Graham, Gabriel Hayes, left the firm earlier this year.  We have since reestablished discussions and the Global Finance Group is preparing a proposal that a portion (about $30 million) of the Enron Cash Balance Plan portfolio be dedicated to an emerging managers portfolio.  One-third of this money ($10 million) would be invested in bonds, which could be placed with Smith Graham, as the fixed-income manager .  (Total Plan assets are about $235 million.)

The proposal will be submitted to the Plan Administrative Committee at its quarterly meeting on May 3rd.  The proposal should be well received as the Committiee has previously requested that  we optimize our existing allocation to minority money managers.  Gerald Smith has been advised that Enron is looking at ways to allocate money to the firm, and that a decision should be reached sometime in May.  We have not communicated the specific details of our intentions as of yet pending the outcome of the May 3rd meeting.

I am available for further discussion at your convenience.

Tim DeSpain

  <content type="text" name="message">Ken/Jeff:

As part of the Culture Committee discussions, "Leadership" has been identified as an area of concern at Enron.  There are of course many definitions of leadership and, as such, we would like to define leadership as it applies to Enron's culture and business objectives.  As a result, we think it is important to meet with each of you to discuss your views of how "leadership at Enron" should be defined.  We believe the best way to achieve this end is to discuss with each of you:

1.  The criteria you used to choose Enron's current business leaders.

2.  The attributes you believe Enron's leaders should possess.

3.  Whether or not and to what extent you believe leadership impacts the bottom line at Enron?

We would prefer to have this discussion with both of you together.  But that may be an impossible task.  I will speak with each of your assistants to arrange a convenient time to discuss these issues.

Thanks

  <content name="title" action="cluster">Hello - From India -[Please Read]</content>
  <content type="text" name="message">Respected Sirs:

This is Xafira Mendonsa, one of the nominees to your round table held on November 14, 2000. 

Just felt like writing these few lines telling you that - It was great being with you in Houston. Thanks so much for giving us the chance to work for your Company in India. It is really very depressing to see things going bad, but I love and treasure Enron very much and along with Enron you will always be remembered by each one of us. I have worked for this Company for 7 long years and it has been a home for me and for my family as my husband and son also work in the same project. How I wish this project would go on and on and I could retire in the same company.  

Unfortunately things are not rosy here anymore. However, I am opted to accept new challenges and jobs across the Enron Corp. world-wide - if given an opportunity. Here in Mumbai, I have been recently promoted from an Executibe Secretary to an Administration Officer. I request you to keep me in mind and give me a chance to serve the Company anywere outside India.

Once again, I thank Enron for treating its employees so well and making us all feel important and wanted. I am proud to be associated with Enron and it is for that reason that I want to work for you till I retire.

Do consider my humble request and will be anxiously waiting for a reply. Greetings and many thanks from India.

Best regards with Blessings from the Almightly,
Xafira</content>

As you know, last year Enron produced its first ever EHS annual report with some mentions of our new Corporate Responsibility program.  We are producing this year's version, which is expanded both in the environmental reporting as well as our human rights and social initiatives covered.  Mike Terraso and I would like to include an opening letter by the two of you (last year Ken signed it).  Will you please review the attached and edit, comment or approve by next week?

  <content type="text" name="message">Hi Ken Louise and Jeff,

Attached are the links to the multimedia cases Harvard prepared in association with the cases recently written, excerpted from the videos they took of the 3 of you a few months ago.

I'm remotely  accessing this while travelling and have been unable to open the videos.  This is likely a function of the remote connection.  

Ken and Jeff, I'll review each of yours when I'm better able to access. I'll then  provide you my comments (if any), as you will need to sign off on the release and use of these by Harvard.

Louise, will you please review at least your portion?

Thanks!

--Christie.

Hi Christie,
I'm happy to send you the links to our two Enron multimedia cases.  The
written part of the cases is exactly the same as their traditional,
hard-copy counterparts; the video clips are taken from the longer Enron
video tapes we had made in January.

I'll be sending you the required paperwork for your sign-off.  (We'll also
need sign-offs from the three case protagonists--Ken, Jeff and Louise.)  In
the meantime, if you could review the cases and pass them on for Ken's,
Jeff's and Louise's approvals, that would be great.

Please feel free to contact me if the video links don't work--I've checked
them on my machine and they seen to work fine, but things sometimes get
distorted in transmission--or if you have any questions.  Thanks for all
your help, and have a great weekend!
Best,
Meg

  <content type="text" name="message">Ken and Jeff:

Glen Darden, the President and CEO of Quicksilver Resources, Inc., is a longtime personal and professional friend of mine.  Recently, he has asked whether I would consider serving as an outside Director on the Board of Directors of Quicksilver.  Before meeting with Glen to discuss this further, I want to make sure that Enron does not have any objections.

Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, Quicksilver is a natural gas and crude oil production company engaged in the development and acquisition of long-lived producing natural gas and oil properties. Quicksilver began trading publicly in March of 1999 on the American Stock Exchange (KWK).  Quicksilver has a long standing business relationship with Enron.  Enron has historically entered into pre-pays and hedging transactions related to natural gas production and continues to do so today.  Enron (via JEDI) also provided some financing at the time of the merger of Quicksilver and Mercury Exploration and was a significant shareholder of Quicksilver at the time of its initial public offering.  I believe JEDI has since divested this stockholding.

If I were to serve on the board of Quicksilver, I expect that there will be related party transactions of a routine ongoing nature that would need to be disclosed and which I would need to abstain from voting on as a member of the board.  However, I do not feel there would be any material conflicts of interest as Quicksilver's core business is complementary to Enron, not competitive with Enron.  As a personal matter, it is an experience that would be beneficial and would provide valuable personal visibility in our industry.

I am scheduled to meet with Glen and others at Quicksilver later this month to further discuss this possibility.  Would each of you please let me know after due consideration whether you have any objection to or concern with the position.  Please do not hesitate to call me (x67713) if you have any questions or wish to discuss this further.

Thanks.

  <content type="text" name="message">I have held discussions with Tim Weithman, Ashley Kerr &amp; Ken Brooks (immediate supervisor) regarding a request for vacation for the 3rd or 4th week in May. I have been told recently by both Ms. Kerr as well as Mr. Weithman that those of us being severed from the company are not permitted to take any vacation time between now and June 1st. It would seem that there are several inconsistencies regarding Enron policy as well as how the subject was presented both to the group as well as individually. Below are the inconsistencies I speak of.

During the group meeting in the beginning of April there was no mention of "vacation freezes". The only reference to time that was mentioned was that you must be employed by Enron as of June 1, 2001 to receive the severance package.
During my private discussion, in which both Ms. Kerr and Ms. Gray were present, I was presented with the specifics of the severance package. I specifically remember being asked for my current unused vacation amount. I gave them the amount of 152 hours and was told that I would be reimbursed for that total unless, of course, I took any additional vacation. This implied that regular Enron vacation policies would be in effect. Again, at no time was it presented to me that I was ineligible to take ANY of my earned vacation or that there would be any deviations from normal Enron policy regarding vacation.
At no time has Mr. Weithman, Ms. Gray, Ms. Kerr or any other Enron agent made public a policy of vacation freezes.
At no time were there ever any public or private requests that the plans for those with previously scheduled vacations to be made available to any Enron agent.
I can find nothing in my severance package that states any deviation from the standard Enron vacation policy.
I realize that Enron policy requires vacation approval from the supervising employee. It states in that policy the following:
"An employee's preference for scheduling vacation should be adopted when possible."
"The supervisor must verify that unit staffing needs are met before approving an employee's vacation request."
I am currently still an Enron employee.  I have also verified that staffing needs are met. 

In summary, as you can see there are several inconsistencies with regards to the vacation policy for those being severed at Clinton Energy. It more than offends me that I am being prohibited from taken ANY part of the 152 hours of accrued vacation that is, by all accounts, mine to take. This being said, I am formally requesting one last time that I be granted my vacation request during the month of May. Furthermore I would like this approval as soon as possible so that I may make necessary arrangements. As you review this I am consulting an attorney so that I may be advised of my rights regarding this matter.

Thank you,

Sean Zurbrick

  <content type="text" name="message">Hi Ken and Jeff,  

This email is being sent to let you know that my consulting contract with Enron has finally come to an end.  It has been a great experience to me to have been involved in the development of such successful international projects as, Puerto Quetzal in Guatemala in 1993, Batangas and Subic Bay in 1992/93 in the Philippines and Guam in 1996, all of which are still contributing to Enron's earnings.  The opportunities provided me during the first 26 years with Northern Natural Gas/Internorth, from which I retired in 1988, and the last 11 years as a consultant for Enron Development and Enron International have made me a better person and I thank you both for this.

I will continue to  be involved in consulting and development of both power and natural gas projects, although on a more limited basis, and only as an independent.

Should there be any need for my services or need to be contacted for any reason, I can be reached at:

Good luck as you both lead Enron, the Greatest Company, into the future,  and once again, Thanks for the opportunity!!

Chris Bartlett at Harvard presented (last week) the 2 most recent Enron cases he wrote to the "Harvard Program for Global Leadership".  This is an Exec Ed program for CXO's and Senior management from throughout the world. Chris called me today to say that the cases received outstanding reviews, and that the largely international CXO audience was both knowledgeable about, and very 'pro-Enron'!

Enron's Power Crisis

"Bizarre" is how everyone describes it. On Aug. 14, Enron CEO Jeff Skilling--a self-described "brilliant" 47-year-old who says he's never suffered any kind of failure--announced he was relinquishing his title and leaving the company after a mere six months in the top job. Skilling insisted that the parting was voluntary, laying the blame on unspecified personal, non-health-related reasons. But by leaving when and how he did, Skilling forfeited a roughly $20 million severance package and gained the responsibility of repaying a $2 million loan that Enron would have forgiven had he stuck around until the end of the year. 
More bizarre than his timing is how quickly Enron's once tight relationship with Wall Street deteriorated during Skilling's reign. The ex-CEO was famously boastful--insisting that Enron's nascent broadband trading business was worth $35 billion--and thin-skinned, declaring on a conference call that a money manager who dared ask for a balance sheet was an "asshole."
The task of restoring Enron's glory falls to Ken Lay, the company's chairman and former CEO, who has replaced Skilling. He's got his work cut out. Enron's "overall quality of earnings has deteriorated, its level of behind-the-scenes financial engineering has increased, and its overall standing with the Street has plunged," wrote UBS Warburg analyst Ron Barone in a recent report--and Barone is one of the bulls. Despite Lay's insistence that there aren't any "accounting issues, trading issues, or reserve issues" at Enron, investors are hesitant to bid the company back up. Indeed, Enron now trades at around $38, down some 60% from its 52-week high. 
One reason Lay's job is so tough is that, as FORTUNE pointed out in March (see "Is Enron Overpriced?" on fortune.com), Enron's financials are on the dim side of opaque. While Wall Street was once willing to take the company's word on financial performance, it no longer is. And because Enron gives analysts so little to work with, building independent models is next to impossible. Enron's major business, the trading and marketing of energy, is relatively new and extremely complicated. Seemingly basic questions--like the effects of lower natural gas prices and less volatility in the energy markets on Enron's profits--are still unanswered. And there's confusion about the relationship between Enron's reported earnings, which reflect changes in the value of its energy-trading portfolio, and the actual cash coming in. In the first half of the year, Enron reported net income of $810 million and cash flow from operations of negative $1.3 billion. 
Then there's the challenge of convincing investors that Enron itself believes it has a rosy future. High-level executives besides Skilling have recently left, and analysts like Jeff Dietert at Simmons say insider selling has been "aggressive" recently. While Enron executives still hold big chunks of stock, according to Thomson Financial/Lancer Analytics, insiders have sold 1.75 million shares in 2001--and they've sold as the stock has fallen, which is generally regarded as a bad sign. Among the biggest sellers: Lay, who has sold 408,000 shares at prices ranging from $81 last winter to $43 in July. Other sellers have included two executives who have since resigned: new business unit head Lou Pai and broadband chief Kenneth Rice. Enron says that sales are related to the pending expiration of options. 
Lay is moving swiftly to address those concerns. He's promised the Street more disclosure about Enron's operations, and to combat criticism about Enron's weak bench he recently announced a new office of the chairman, anointing veterans Greg Whalley and Mark Frevert to help him run the company. No word yet on whether he plans to start buying Enron stock. 
Quote: Wall Street will no longer take the company's word on financial performance.

Enron Offers to Complete Indian Power Plant If Govt Backs Sale

Enron Offers to Complete Indian Power Plant If Govt Backs Sale

     Mumbai, Sept. 6 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. said it will
finish building a $3 billion power plant in India if the
government backs a plan by the biggest energy trader to sell its
majority stake in the unprofitable venture to local banks.

     Work stopped in June on the second construction phase of the
power station in Maharashtra state because the plant's sole
customer, the state electricity board, owes $64 million in unpaid
bills and ceased buying power in May. The expansion, which is 95
percent complete, would add 1,444 megawatts of capacity.

     Enron offered to sell its 65 percent stake in Dabhol Power
Co., the plant's owner, in three tranches to local banks that
helped finance the project, Business Standard reported, citing a
letter to India's Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee from Enron.

     ``We are willing to complete the project at cost should they
(government) proceed with our plan,'' said Jimmy Mogal, a
spokesman for Dabhol Power Co., Enron's local unit.

     Enron would sell 40 percent of its shares in Dabhol once
negotiations with construction operators to finish the work begin.
It would sell a further 50 percent of its stake once construction
restarts in April 2002. The rest would be sold when the project is
completed by January 2003, the paper said.

     Contractors stopped work on the expansion in June because
they hadn't been paid since April.

    Indian banks loaned $1.4 billion to Dabhol without government
guarantees on the loans. The $600 million lent by ABN Amro, Bank
of America Corp. and other overseas banks is covered by government
guarantees.

     Indian lenders would have to disburse about $320 million for
completion of project, which includes construction of a 5 million-
ton liquefied natural gas import and storage facility.



INDIA PRESS: Enron Proposes 3-Stage Sale Of Dabhol Stake

09/06/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) is proposing to sell the foreign equity in India's Dabhol Power Co. to Indian financial institutions through a three-part payment structure extending until Jan. 1, 2003, reports the Business Standard. 
Enron holds a 65.86% stake in DPC, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, or MSEB, holds 14.14%, and Bechtel Corp. (X.BTL) and General Electric Co. (GE) each hold 10%.
Dabhol is a 2,184-megawatt power project in the western Indian state of Mahrashtra. 
Enron wants to sell its equity in DPC following payment disputes with its sole buyer, MSEB, and the federal government's failure to honor its counterguarantee. 
DPC's 1,444-megawatt phase II is about 95% complete. Its construction was abandoned by the contractor because of DPC's inability to pay. 
Under the structure, Enron has asked for initial payment of 40% of the purchase price of the entire foreign equity at the start of renegotiations between potential buyers and construction operators. 
The second installment of 50% has to be paid at the resumption of construction of the second phase of the project, or by April 1, 2002, whichever is earlier. The third and final installment of 10% has to be paid at the time of mechanical completion of the 2,144-MW power plant and regassification facility, or by Jan. 1, 2003, whichever is earlier, the report says. 
In a proposal submitted to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Enron has said in the event the federal government doesn't directly purchase the foreign equity, it should guarantee the payment obligation in full. 
The $2.9 billion Dabhol project has an equity component of $1 billion, with foreign players, including Enron, contributing $858.6 million. India's financial institutions have a total exposure of over 60 billion rupees ($1=INR47.16), the report says. 
The Indian financial institutions, currently preparing a plan for the project's early revival, are considering Enron's proposal, the report said.

More companies looking to hedge their exposure to volatile energy prices
By BRAD FOSS
AP Business Writer

Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - Harrah's Entertainment Inc. is willing to bet on many things. The cost of energy isn't one of them. 
Stung by high electricity and natural gas prices last year, Harrah's is not taking any more chances when it comes to buying the power to keep its casino on the New Jersey shore as bright and noisy as the nearby boardwalk and as cool as an Atlantic breeze.
The company has since locked in long-term supply contracts at fixed prices with Houston-based Enron Corp., joining the growing legion of hotels, manufacturers, retailers and technology firms behaving more like utilities in terms of hedging their exposure to volatile energy prices. 
In January, Harrah's Atlantic City - 86,000 square feet of casino space and more than 1,100 hotel rooms - rang up a natural gas bill that topped $220,000, nearly quadruple what it normally pays during a winter month. 
Under the 7-year deal with Enron, Harrah's agreed to pay roughly $5 per 1,000 cubic feet for a certain amount of natural gas. 
"We wanted to put ourselves in a position where we could even the playing field and not worry about those price spikes," said Stuart Thomas, who oversees energy procurement at Harrah's. 
Last winter, the retail price soared above $10 per 1,000 cubic feet in many parts of the country, and as high as $19 per 1,000 cubic feet in New Jersey. 
At $5 per 1,000 cubic feet, Harrah's natural gas bill last January would have been closer to $60,000. 
While Harrah's will be buffered from the worst-case scenario next January, the company could miss out on some savings if natural gas prices dip below what they've agreed to pay Enron. Harrah's executives said that is a tradeoff they will accept. 
"We didn't do it to save money," said Thomas, emphasizing that Harrah's $40 million-a-year energy bill is a tiny fraction of its overall costs. "We did it to manage risk." 
Harrah's is not alone. Eli Lilly & Co., IBM Corp., Kraft Foods Inc., Saks Inc. and Solvay Polymers Inc. are just some of the companies that have energy management deals with Enron, Duke Energy Corp. and Reliant Resources Inc. 
Enron's energy services unit is head and shoulders above its closest rival in this emerging field, signing $40 billion in contracts since it was created in 1997. After $200 million in losses since 1998, it recorded its first profits of $100 million in profit in the first half of 2001. 
Jeremy Blachman, the division's chief operating officer, attributes the success to the breadth of its portfolio, which includes deals with food and beverage giant Quaker Oats Co. and the Archdiocese of Chicago, which signed a seven-year agreement worth nearly $250 million. 
"Over the last couple of years, and particularly the last 6 to 9 months, we have seen our business go across markets," Blachman said. 
A.G. Edwards & Sons analyst Mike Heim said Enron's energy services unit, which is essentially a seller of electricity and natural gas at retail prices, remains but "a blip" within Enron, which gets 80 percent of its profit from wholesale marketing and trading. 
But if power and natural gas prices remain volatile, "it has the potential to become 10 to 20 percent of their business down the line," Heim said. 
Makers of chemicals, fertilizer, glass and steel - some of the most energy-intensive industries in the United States - were hit the hardest in the past 18 months as natural gas and electricity soared to prices never seen before. 
Companies that were not protected with long-term contracts took it in the neck, said P.J. Juvekar, a senior chemicals analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. 
After Dow Chemical Co., which was protected, completed its purchase of Union Carbide Corp., which wasn't, Dow was hit with a first-quarter loss of $685 million, compared with a profit of $512 million a year earlier. 
"Most of the disappointment came from the Carbide side, where they were fully exposed to $10 (per 1,000 cubic feet) natural gas prices without any hedges," Juvekar said. 
Companies that were protected from last year's energy spikes recognized earlier on that "we didn't feel as comfortable as the market deregulated," said Michael Thaman, chief financial officer of fiberglass giant Owens Corning, which needs massive quantities of natural gas and electricity to melt billions of pounds of glass each year. 
"We certainly don't have any illusions about our ability to beat the market," said Thaman, whose company signed a 10-year contract with Enron worth $1 billion. 
In the case of Harrah's, the most important thing was to rein in energy costs without skimping on amenities at the casino or hotel, said Bill Simpson, facilities manager at the Atlantic City property. 
Shutting down unused slot machines - 3,500 are on at all times - or adjusting the casino floor thermostat - set at a constant 70 degrees - were never considered last winter even as natural gas and electricity prices soared to record levels. Neither was passing along the costs to hotel guests by adding an energy surcharge on their bills, a strategy pursued by many hotel companies.

Enron still plans sale of Portland General
NEW YORK -- Enron Corp. said Wednesday it still plans to sell its Portland General utility in Oregon. 
Enron has been trying to sell the utility for more than a year. A $3.1 billion sale to Sierra Pacific Resources collapsed in April because the California power crisis made it too difficult to win approval, the companies had said. 
Enron is "getting close to another transaction" involving Portland General, Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said at a Lehman Bros. energy conference in New York. 


Power regulators still debating decisions on key energy issues

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - State power regulators were poised Thursday to suspend direct access, the option that allows Californians to choose their electricity provider. 
Though a mere 200,000 Californians switched from their local utility to companies such as Green Mountain Energy or Enron, the Legislature has ordered the Public Utilities Commission to temporarily end consumer choice to keep three struggling utilities from losing more customers.
Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison Co. and San Diego Gas and Electric Co. are each are on the hook for the more than $9.5 billion the state spent buying electricity on their customers' behalf this year. 
The PUC is expected to suspend direct access retroactively to July 1. Energy service providers, such as solar and wind-powered electricity seller Green Mountain Energy, say it's unconstitutional, and have vowed to fight the PUC in court. 
Likely to be missing from Thursday's meeting are several key issues that would affect Californians' electric bills: 
- A proposal to grant the state's power-buying agency the authority to raise electric rates on its own without PUC review to ensure such rates are justified. 
- A proposal to raise rates for San Diego Gas and Electric Co. residential customers by an average of 12 percent. 
- A proposal that bills Pacific Gas and Electric Co. $6.5 billion, Southern California Edison Co. $4 billion and SDG&E $1.5 billion to help the state recoup its power-buying costs. 
PUC President Loretta Lynch said the commission needs more time to review a flood of comments from utilities, consumer advocates and other parties to those decisions. 
The state plans to recover some of the money it has spent buying power by collecting a portion of ratepayer money. 
The more ratepayers each utility has, the lighter the blow to each customer's electric bill. But it would come at the expense of consumer choice, which lawmakers had promoted as the method by which deregulation would foster competition and lead to lower electric rates. 
Rick Counihan, vice president and general manager of Green Mountain Energy, said if the PUC suspends consumer choice until the state stops buying power for the utilities - potentially a decade down the road - consumer choice is dead. 
"(Direct access) was one of the few good things that came out of the restructuring," Counihan said. 
Just as some environmentally conscious customers buy organic produce or recycled paper products, the option to leave their utility and buy power largely generated by the wind or sun was another way they could make a difference, he said. 
Under the PUC plan, customers who signed up with an energy provider before July 1 could keep their contracts until they expire. Deals signed after that date would be nullified, and the customer would be forced to return to a local utility. 
PUC Commissioner Richard Bilas, a vocal proponent of direct access, is hopeful it could resume after the finances of PG&E, Edison and SDG&E improve. 
"When the utilities get back in the business - if they ever get back in the business of going out and buying electricity on behalf of themselves - that could open up direct access again," Bilas said. He predicted that could happen 18 months from now. 
Counihan was less optimistic. 
"I'm very skeptical that we, or other providers, will come back to California," Counihan said. "We'll very likely take our marketing activities and reallocate to other states that are more friendly." 
Counihan also worried a temporary suspension would give the big three utilities no incentive to retain an infrastructure of computers and other technology put into place to process customers who switched to the alternative energy firms.

  <content type="text" name="message">OUTLOOK EMAIL NOTIFICATION

Your Date of Migration is: May 2nd

YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO SEND E-MAIL unless you take the following action:
Please go through your Notes email and clean out as many old/un-needed email items as possible BEFORE your date of migration.  After you are migrated to Outlook you will only be allocated 100MB of total Mailbox space.   If more than this amount of data is migrated to Outlook YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEND E-MAIL until it is below the 100MB limit.  Cleaning up your Notes email now will prevent this from happening to YOU.

Enron's messaging platform is migrating from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Outlook 2000 worldwide.  You will be accessing Outlook for all of your email functions. 

WHY IS ENRON MIGRATING TO OUTLOOK 2000?

Many factors contributed to the decision to migrate from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Exchange/Outlook.  The most prominent factors were:

?	Significant advantages to moving to a product that is more integrated with current Enron apps (Windows 2000, Office and Internet Explorer)
?	More efficient Shared PC and Roaming User features
?	Improved support and integration for Palm/CE devices
?	Instant Messaging capabilities

WHAT IS BEING MIGRATED TO OUTLOOK 2000?

?	Email Messages.  From the date of your scheduled migration, the last (30) thirty days of your Email will be converted for use in Outlook.
?	All your folders in Notes you use to store email messages in.
?	To Do Items
?	Journal Items
?	Calendar Entries dating from (1) one year in the past to (10) ten years in the future will be converted.
?	Address Books, but NOT your Distribution Lists that you created.  You will need to re-create these in Outlook.

Thank you,

Outlook 2000 Migration Team

Current Notes User:

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You will now be able to view your mailbox.

	

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

	Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

	713-853-1411

  <content type="text" name="message">Ken and Jeff:

Glen Darden, the President and CEO of Quicksilver Resources, Inc., is a longtime personal and professional friend of mine.  Recently, he has asked whether I would consider serving as an outside Director on the Board of Directors of Quicksilver.  Before meeting with Glen to discuss this further, I want to make sure that Enron does not have any objections.

Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, Quicksilver is a natural gas and crude oil production company engaged in the development and acquisition of long-lived producing natural gas and oil properties. Quicksilver began trading publicly in March of 1999 on the American Stock Exchange (KWK).  Quicksilver has a long standing business relationship with Enron.  Enron has historically entered into pre-pays and hedging transactions related to natural gas production and continues to do so today.  Enron (via JEDI) also provided some financing at the time of the merger of Quicksilver and Mercury Exploration and was a significant shareholder of Quicksilver at the time of its initial public offering.  I believe JEDI has since divested this stockholding.

If I were to serve on the board of Quicksilver, I expect that there will be related party transactions of a routine ongoing nature that would need to be disclosed and which I would need to abstain from voting on as a member of the board.  However, I do not feel there would be any material conflicts of interest as Quicksilver's core business is complementary to Enron, not competitive with Enron.  As a personal matter, it is an experience that would be beneficial and would provide valuable personal visibility in our industry.

I am scheduled to meet with Glen and others at Quicksilver later this month to further discuss this possibility.  Would each of you please let me know after due consideration whether you have any objection to or concern with the position.  Please do not hesitate to call me (x67713) if you have any questions or wish to discuss this further.

Thanks.

  <content type="text" name="message">Hi Ken Louise and Jeff,

Attached are the links to the multimedia cases Harvard prepared in association with the cases recently written, excerpted from the videos they took of the 3 of you a few months ago.

I'm remotely  accessing this while travelling and have been unable to open the videos.  This is likely a function of the remote connection.  

Ken and Jeff, I'll review each of yours when I'm better able to access. I'll then  provide you my comments (if any), as you will need to sign off on the release and use of these by Harvard.

Louise, will you please review at least your portion?

Thanks!

--Christie.

Hi Christie,
I'm happy to send you the links to our two Enron multimedia cases.  The
written part of the cases is exactly the same as their traditional,
hard-copy counterparts; the video clips are taken from the longer Enron
video tapes we had made in January.

I'll be sending you the required paperwork for your sign-off.  (We'll also
need sign-offs from the three case protagonists--Ken, Jeff and Louise.)  In
the meantime, if you could review the cases and pass them on for Ken's,
Jeff's and Louise's approvals, that would be great.

Please feel free to contact me if the video links don't work--I've checked
them on my machine and they seen to work fine, but things sometimes get
distorted in transmission--or if you have any questions.  Thanks for all
your help, and have a great weekend!
Best,
Meg

I met with Michael this afternoon, and we should schedule him for additional interviews.  I know that he has a schedule conflict next Wednesday, but is generally available starting the following week.  Let's get him into the next real-time interview round, or do a custom schedule if it goes out past a couple of weeks.

Thanks,

Jeff,

Judy Lay Allen, an associate of yours on the Federal Reserve board, spoke with Joannie Williamson today regarding my desire to interview at Enron.

I am a graduate of Princeton University with two years experience in financial modeling and communications.   Towards assessing my skill set relative to peers, I took and received a 740 on my GMAT.  I have also interned in a gas exploration company and am familiar with the industry; likewise, I have worked with clients in telecommunications and am aware of the work Enron is doing in the bandwidth trading/pooling field.

I am aware of Enron's executive training/business analyst programs and am highly interested in exploring opportunities therein.  I am in Houston through Friday evening and, given the short notice, would be grateful for any opportunity to meet with the appropriate person any time Thursday or Friday.

I look forward to interviewing and applying my experience at Enron.

Best regards,
Michael Kuntz

  <content type="text" name="message">Steve Kean and I believe quite strongly, within a four peer group structure,  that we need to allocate somewhere between 30 and 50 percent of Gov't./ public  Affairs out of commercial support into specialized technical- there is a clear divide between individuals in the Gov't/public  Affairs groups  who are managing significant risk for the company and having a significant and  direct impact on commercial activities/ net income( these individuals should be moved to specialized technical)....and others who are performing a less strategic function( who should remain in the commercial support category). With that said, it is probably not necessary to undertake this effort for  mid-year PRC purposes since we are probably moving to a three peer stucture where that split could be achieved (for year-end purposes where the compensation impact would be felt). If we stay with the four group stucture, I intend to push hard for the remapping of Gov't Affairs by year-end.
    On a completely seperate issue, I continue to be  very concerned about the impact of the "preferred" distribution  relative to the bottom category for " commercial support" groups(I'm not implying this is'nt an issue for commercial groups- I just don't have the same ability to assess the impact there)....the concern, simply stated,  is that  it may be entirely  counterproductive to force individuals who are not performance problems  into a category that has significant implications for their careers here at Enron, particularly after going thru the past year where many of the non-performers in my group and others  were moved out of the company- the replacement costs for moving good performers out of the company for the sake of a "preferred" distribution are quite high...and that is even before you begin  to assess the incalcuable damage to morale that will invariably occour.
       Thanks.

Subject:	PEER GROUP MAPPING

Following my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group mapping for all business units. This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.

We were considering moving to a 3 Peer Group Structure however it as agreed at the last PRC Committee Meeting  to stay with the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most activities had been placed with the exception of just  2 or 3. It was agreed that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 Peer Groups. All functions/activities within the business units should now be reflected on the acttached. 

The actions points from this excercise are:

1	to review and agree the attached mapping 

2    consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in previous PRC meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them 	as indicated on the attachment.

3	invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider questionable or requiring further explanation.

      Please return your comments to David Oxley by Friday May 25.

      To have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final VP/MD PRC Meetings.  Definitions of the peer groups are also attached for your ease of
      reference.

  <content type="text" name="message">We have designed an additional Daily Position Report which consolidates P&amp;L, positions, maturity gap, and VAR by commodity rather than business unit.  In accordance with the Risk Policy paragraph III - Limit Structure, possible breaches of limits are monitored against commodities rather than Business Units.

This report is currently being published to the Executive Viewer under the name of DPR RAC (will be retitled to DPR commodity). We are in the process of granting each one of you access to this report.  When access is granted to all DPR viewers, we plan to remove the limits amount off of the Business Unit Daily Position Report as the limits are granted by commodity, not business unit.

Please contact me with any questions/comments or concerns.

Thank you

  <content type="text" name="message">Jeff,

Judy Lay Allen, an associate of yours on the Federal Reserve board, spoke with Joannie Williamson today regarding my desire to interview at Enron.

I am a graduate of Princeton University with two years experience in financial modeling and communications.   Towards assessing my skill set relative to peers, I took and received a 740 on my GMAT.  I have also interned in a gas exploration company and am familiar with the industry; likewise, I have worked with clients in telecommunications and am aware of the work Enron is doing in the bandwidth trading/pooling field.

I am aware of Enron's executive training/business analyst programs and am highly interested in exploring opportunities therein.  I am in Houston through Friday evening and, given the short notice, would be grateful for any opportunity to meet with the appropriate person any time Thursday or Friday.

I look forward to interviewing and applying my experience at Enron.

Best regards,
Michael Kuntz

  <content type="text" name="message">On May 10, 2001, a memo was sent out regarding "Peer Group Mapping".  This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.

Please refer to the attached original memo, if you have not responded to David Oxley and have any comments 
please respond to him by May 25, 2001.

Dave Delainey



Following my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group mapping for all business units. This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.

We were considering moving to a 3 Peer Group Structure however it as agreed at the last PRC Committee Meeting  to stay with the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most activities had been placed with the exception of just  2 or 3. It was agreed that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 Peer Groups. All functions/activities within the business units should now be reflected on the acttached. 

The actions points from this excercise are:

1	to review and agree the attached mapping 

2    consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in previous PRC meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them 	as indicated on the attachment.

3	invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider questionable or requiring further explanation.

      Please return your comments to David Oxley by Friday May 25.

      To have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final VP/MD PRC Meetings.  Definitions of the peer groups are also attached for your ease of
      reference.

  <content type="text" name="message">Stan felt it would be appropriate for the Policy Committee to review the attached changes to the Analyst / Associate PRC process, prior to execution.  In summary, the following modifications have been developed by the heads of the AAPRC Committees (Horton, Kean, and Sherriff) and A/A Program Management (Lemmons):

?	Most cross-calibration will be at the business unit level, since this is where the best interaction and information gathering occurs.  Steps to ensure consistency across the business units are outlined in the memo.  The final PRC meeting will focus on business unit ranking distributions, and the names/attributes of the top performers across the company.
?	The PRC committees have been expanded to improve the quality of representation, and to reflect the diversity of our workforce.  The additions were selected from a pool of high performing VPs and Directors.  To ensure fairness, only VPs and Directors will provide representation on the AAPRC Committee.  
?	An attachment has been included to clarify program tenure and promotion criteria.

Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss by mid-day Wednesday, May 9.  We are planning to release this information to the memo distribution list that evening.

Regards,
Billy

  <content type="text" name="message">Hello, Jeff,

I know you must be quite busy with calls for interviews following your
recent announcement that you were leaving Enron. However, I'm hoping if you
have a moment today, you could provide 2 or 3 quotes about your decision
and where you're heading next for McKinsey &amp; Company's internal news Web
site, NewsNetwork, which has loyal readership across our Firm.  Our
upcoming deadline is tomorrow afternoon in time for our Monday, August 20
edition.  Given that we covered you once before on NN (see article below)
we believe this article would make for an important and worthy follow up.

I will take the liberty of calling you today to ensure you received this
message. Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.

Warm Regards,

Wylie Goodman
Managing Editor
212-415-1316
------------------------------------------
Questions:

1. Can you elaborate more on the reason behind your decision to leave
Enron?
2. What are the most important accomplishments you feel you've achieved
during your tenure as CEO?
3. Do you have any immediate or mid-range plans for yourself personally or
professionally that you can share?
---------------------------------------------

Below is the first NewsNetwork article about your appointment to CEO:



Skilling named CEO at Enron
Dallas alum, longtime President and COO, elected CEO of the $80 billion
energy marketer.

Jeff Skilling (DA 1979-90) joined Enron in 1990, and became COO in 1996.
Under his leadership, Enron expanded its focus from natural gas pipelines
to become the largest gas and power marketer in the United States, as well
as diversifying into risk management and broadband capacity trading.
Kenneth Lay, Chair of Enron's board, told reporters, "Jeff is a big part of
Enron's success, and is clearly ready to lead the company."

Early in his tenure, Skilling helped the company exploit the newly
deregulated natural gas market by developing business models for efficient
trading and risk management. These became the template for the range of
commodity exchanges that now populate Enron's portfolio. McKinsey
contributed as well: Suzanne Nimocks (HO), the Enron co-DCS, says, "We've
worked very closely with Enron and Jeff on launching many of their new
businesses: gas trading, power trading, and pulp and paper."

After 11 years with the Firm, Skilling went to Enron well-versed in
McKinsey culture. According to Suzanne, "Jeff has done a really fine job of
leveraging the strengths of McKinsey and replicating them at Enron. Their
associate analyst program and their personnel review process are modeled on
McKinsey's. He's been able to extract those elements that make McKinsey
special and replicate them in a corporate setting."

Co-DCS Ron Hulme (DA) adds: "For those of us on the CST, it is sometimes
hard to tell whether we are at Enron or back at the office. The great news
is, with Jeff's distinctive leadership, it all works brilliantly."

Enron ranks #18 in the Fortune 500. With revenues topping $60 billion for
the first 9 months of this year, the company is on track to double 1999
results.

I was actually on the phone with my Dad when I received Kenneth Lay's email about your departure, we both wish you luck and hope that everything is ok.  I have been working here as a consultant for the past month or two and have to say that I really enjoy the Enron environment, culture, and company that you helped build.  It really is an incredible place.

Regardless, I currently live in Austin and work here during the weeks.  If you ever get a chance, I'd love to hear from you sometime.  You can always email me here or my other address (wcarberry@sensecorp.com) or call me at 512-791-4709.

My Mom, Dad and I have always admired your successes and I still remember when we went tubing right after you decided to leave a sure thing at McKinsey to take a chance at this new merger-created company called Enron - what an amazing ride.  We do wish you well going forward.

Sincerely,
Wes Carberry</content>

  <content type="text" name="message">Steve Kean and I believe quite strongly, within a four peer group structure,  that we need to allocate somewhere between 30 and 50 percent of Gov't./ public  Affairs out of commercial support into specialized technical- there is a clear divide between individuals in the Gov't/public  Affairs groups  who are managing significant risk for the company and having a significant and  direct impact on commercial activities/ net income( these individuals should be moved to specialized technical)....and others who are performing a less strategic function( who should remain in the commercial support category). With that said, it is probably not necessary to undertake this effort for  mid-year PRC purposes since we are probably moving to a three peer stucture where that split could be achieved (for year-end purposes where the compensation impact would be felt). If we stay with the four group stucture, I intend to push hard for the remapping of Gov't Affairs by year-end.
    On a completely seperate issue, I continue to be  very concerned about the impact of the "preferred" distribution  relative to the bottom category for " commercial support" groups(I'm not implying this is'nt an issue for commercial groups- I just don't have the same ability to assess the impact there)....the concern, simply stated,  is that  it may be entirely  counterproductive to force individuals who are not performance problems  into a category that has significant implications for their careers here at Enron, particularly after going thru the past year where many of the non-performers in my group and others  were moved out of the company- the replacement costs for moving good performers out of the company for the sake of a "preferred" distribution are quite high...and that is even before you begin  to assess the incalcuable damage to morale that will invariably occour.
       Thanks.

Subject:	PEER GROUP MAPPING

Following my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group mapping for all business units. This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.

We were considering moving to a 3 Peer Group Structure however it as agreed at the last PRC Committee Meeting  to stay with the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most activities had been placed with the exception of just  2 or 3. It was agreed that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 Peer Groups. All functions/activities within the business units should now be reflected on the acttached. 

The actions points from this excercise are:

1	to review and agree the attached mapping 

2    consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in previous PRC meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them 	as indicated on the attachment.

3	invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider questionable or requiring further explanation.

      Please return your comments to David Oxley by Friday May 25.

      To have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final VP/MD PRC Meetings.  Definitions of the peer groups are also attached for your ease of
      reference.

Brothers in -kai-
 
just to let you know that I changed my email  address, so if you have any questions or problems with yahoogroups and want to  send me something directly and not to all the guys in the group you can send it  to shackleton@austin.rr.com 
 
Also, I'm attaching the current email member list  so you can update your individual address books.  
 
Note on this list that there are a couple of  updates.  
JGlass is now found jglass@northelginteleport.com 
Elvis  Thompson changed his email address to elvisthompson@aol.com 
I'll remove the old addresses if J and Elvis give  the OK.
 
I see lots of new message traffic  lately.   Mostly from Okies and southeast Texans. Must be the hot  weather has them inside on their PC's.  But it is a good time now to  plan the autumn Beta mini-reunions.
 
I read the news about Rocky's resignation Tuesday.   The word is out that they had to put old Skilling in the witness protection  program so the California attorney general couldn't find him and throw him in a  jail cell with Spike after Spike does Ken Lay. Jeez, you can't even sell  gas nowadays without pissing off the California politburo.  Rocky will  probably surface in Turkey or something (JKS - say hey to your blood brother  Mark there)

Subject:	Organizational Announcement


It is with regret that I have to announce that Jeff Skilling is leaving Enron.  Today, the Board of Directors accepted his resignation as President and CEO of Enron.  Jeff is resigning for personal reasons and his decision is voluntary.  I regret his decision, but I accept and understand it.  I have worked closely with Jeff for more than 15 years, including 11 here at Enron, and have had few, if any, professional relationships that I value more.  I am pleased to say that he has agreed to enter into a consulting arrangement with the company to advise me and the Board of Directors.
Now it's time to look forward.
With Jeff leaving, the Board has asked me to resume the responsibilities of President and CEO in addition to my role as Chairman of the Board.  I have agreed.  I want to assure you that I have never felt better about the prospects for the company.  All of you know that our stock price has suffered substantially over the last few months.  One of my top priorities will be to restore a significant amount of the stock value we have lost as soon as possible.  Our performance has never been stronger; our business model has never been more robust; our growth has never been more certain; and most importantly, we have never had a better nor deeper pool of talent throughout the company.  We have the finest organization in American business today.  Together, we will make Enron the world's leading company.
On Thursday at 10:00 a.m. Houston time, we will hold an all employee meeting at the Hyatt.  We will broadcast the meeting to our employees around the world where technically available, and I look forward to seeing many of you there.</content>

Candidly, this wouldn't have been my approach  (posh location, closed format, odd group, seemingly self-serving agenda).  
 
I read the article below  as unsympatheticand almost  mocking in its tonetoward Enron.  It's  noteworthy theBeverly Hills meeting was not covered in the Los Angeles  papers.  Instead, this article comes fromthe front page of the Bay Area's San Francisco Chronicle (Democratic bastion and  home to both of California's United States Senators, power broker Willie Brown,  Attorney General Bill Lockyer and the state's public utility commission).  
 
Consistent with myconcern about a "coast-to-coast  firestorm"engulfing Enron, the New York  Times ran two articles today that were  unsupportiveof the  company.
 
q        Senator Calls  for Hearings Into Energy Regulators' Moves
By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS
Senator  Dianne Feinstein called for hearings into possible improprieties between members  of the F.E.R.C. and private energy interests.
 
q        Enron's  Dispute With Utility in India Grows More Tangled
By SARITHA RAI
The  dispute between the Enron Corporation and Indian federal and state government  officials keeps getting messier.
 
These follow the Times'  tough piece on Ken Lay yesterday.   Undoubtedly, the Washington Post will have to get into fray  soon.
 
My feeling is that just as  with the "business" side, Enron's public policy strategy needs be well informed,  sophisticated and comprehensive.  I  fear that anything less will fuel the potential of undesirable outcomes for  Enron's reputation, leadership and shareholdervalue.

PS - May I have a copy  of the position paper that was circulated in the Beverly Hills  meeting.

Enron's secret bid to save deregulation 
PRIVATE  MEETING: Chairman pitches his plan to prominent Californians  Christian Berthelsen, Scott Winokur,  Chronicle Staff Writers 
Saturday, May 26, 2001  ?2001 San Francisco Chronicle   
URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2001/05/26/MN209410.DTL   
Energy executive Kenneth Lay, head of powerful Enron Corp., quietly courted  Arnold Schwarzenegger, Richard Riordan, Michael Milken and other luminaries  this week in Beverly Hills to drum up support for his solution to California's  energy crisis.  
His prescription called for more rate increases, an end to state and  federal investigations and less rather than more regulation.  
Lay, a close friend of President Bush and one of his largest campaign  contributors, hosted a private 90-minute meeting in a conference room at the  Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills on Thursday.  
Among the participants were Milken, the former head of the Drexel Burnham  Lambert investment banking firm who pleaded guilty to fraud charges in 1990  and who now runs a think tank based in Santa Monica; movie star  Schwarzenegger;  
and Riordan, the mayor of Los Angeles. Schwarzenegger and Riordan have been  courted recently as GOP gubernatorial candidates.  
One participant, who agreed to speak on the condition he not be identified,  said the meeting appeared to be geared toward getting participants to support  Lay's vision and then champion it to officials who are trying to solve the  state's energy mess.  
PLAN TO RESCUE DEREGULATION
The source said the timing and tone of the meeting suggested Lay is  concerned that California will abandon its disastrous experiment with power  markets by either re-regulating the system or creating a government authority  to provide electricity. Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation last week to create  and fund a state power authority that would build, buy and run power plants in  California.  
"They're trying to rescue deregulation," the source said of Enron  executives. "They think the whole state power authority is a bad idea."  
At the meeting, Enron representatives circulated a four-page position paper  titled "Comprehensive Solution for California," which was obtained by The  Chronicle. It said ratepayers should bear responsibility for the billions in  debt incurred by the state's public utilities and that investigations of power  price manipulation and political rhetoric are making matters worse.  
The paper made no mention of the possibility that much of the runaway  electricity costs in California is due to market manipulation by power  generators and traders -- a possibility given credibility in studies by  regulators and economists.  
One of the talking points read: "Get deregulation right this time --  California needs a real electricity market, not government takeovers." Another  point suggested giving consumers monetary rebates for conserving electricity.  
INVOLVED IN EARLY DAYS
Lay has been an aggressive champion of deregulated electricity markets and  was an early advocate in persuading California to begin its experiment with a  competitive power market system.  
Lay has created a new kind of company in the process, one that essentially  produces nothing but makes money as a middle-man, buying electricity from  generators and selling it to consumers. During the first quarter of this year,  Enron's revenues increased 281 percent to $50.1 billion.  
Asked about the purpose of the meeting, Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for  Enron, said she would "look into that" and then did not return repeated  telephone calls seeking comment. One participant said Denne was present at the  meeting.  
D.C. CONNECTIONS
Meanwhile, Lay's power in Washington is reported to have reached  unprecedented heights. According to a story in yesterday's New York Times, Lay  supplied the Bush administration with a list of candidates for jobs regulating  the power industry and even interviewed one of them. The story also said Lay  essentially threatened to seek the removal of the chairman of the Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission, Curt Hebert, if he does not support Lay's desire  to further deregulate the nation's electricity system. Lay denied the  allegation.  
Also in attendance at this week's meeting were Bruce Karatz, chief  executive of home builder Kaufman &amp; Broad; Ray Irani, chief executive of  Occidental Petroleum; and Kevin Sharer, chief executive of biotech giant  Amgen.  
Among those who were invited but did not attend were former Los Angeles  Lakers star Earvin "Magic" Johnson; supermarket magnate and Bill Clinton  supporter Ron Burkle; and Dennis Tito, recently returned from the world's  first civilian space trip.  
Milken, through a spokesman, confirmed that he attended the meeting, but  declined to be interviewed. Schwarzenegger could not be reached for comment  through a publicist, and Sharer did not return a call yesterday afternoon.  
A spokesman for Riordan, Peter Hidalgo, said the Los Angeles mayor  attended,  
but was "not intending to formulate any kind of policy position on this  issue.  
His intent is to listen to all sides."  
Attached to the Enron handout was a two-page open letter, addressed to  Davis and the state Legislature, apparently prepared for those who support  Lay's position and would be willing to sign their names to it. The source who  participated in the meeting said those assembled appeared noncommittal and  asked a number of questions of Lay, but did not agree to champion his agenda.

  <content name="title" action="cluster">Texas Children's Hopes to Remain in The CHIP Program</content>
  <content type="text" name="message">As you perhaps will have read in today's "Houston Chronicle," Texas
Children's Health Plan has sent the Texas Health and Human Services
Commission a notice of termination of our participation as a contractor in
the Children's Health Insurance Program known as CHIP.

The decision to send the notice of termination was made after we were
informed by the HHSC of a new individual member premium rate that would
cause the already substantial losses we have incurred from the CHIP program
to grow even more rapidly.  To date, the CHIP program in Texas Children's
Health Plan has recorded a $9.7 million loss.  The new rate is predicted to
cause an additional $16 million loss over the next year.

Texas Children's Wants to Continue in The CHIP Program

Even though we sent the HHSC a notice of termination, we continue to
negotiate with them in good faith.   We began these negotiations nine months
ago, in December, 2000.  That was when we realized the program, only six
months old at that time, had been designed without appropriate provisions to
cover the medical costs of caring for children with catastrophic and
chronically devastating conditions and illnesses.

One of the main reasons more than 48,000 CHIP families have chosen Texas
Children's Health Plan as their CHIP provider is that we are able to care
for the sickest children.  In fact, we are the only provider in the state
who has the medical, surgical, nursing and other allied health services to
care for scores of serious pediatric conditions and diseases.  This is not
bragging; it is fact.
What it means is that Texas Children's is experiencing significantly higher
costs in its CHIP program as we respond to the medical needs of many very
sick children in the CHIP program.

It is very important for all of us to know that Texas Children's Health Plan
specifically and the Texas Children's Hospital Integrated Delivery System
very sincerely want to remain in the CHIP program.  We were totally
supportive of its creation by the Texas legislature and continue to believe
the program fills a crucial void in providing health care to children who
otherwise would not receive it.

Texas Children's Is Not Alone in This Dilemma

It is also important to tell you that all the other CHIP contractors in the
state are experiencing losses from their participation in the CHIP program.
In fact, the Health and Human Services Commission itself has confirmed that
cumulative losses in all the CHIP programs in the state from May, 2000 when
the program began, to June, 2001 total $38 million.

We are relatively confident that both our past loss, which is 25 percent of
the total, statewide CHIP loss, as well as our projected losses are larger
than those of any other program.  Again, this is because of the large number
of very seriously ill patients Texas Children's has in its CHIP membership.


We Pledge Our Best Efforts to Find a Solution

I want you to know that Texas Children's Health Plan and the Texas
Children's Hospital Integrated Delivery System will continue to do
everything possible to find a solution to this situation.

In fact, Texas Children's Health Plan has retained two independent,
third-party actuaries who are working to validate both Texas Children's
Health Plan CHIP data as well as data developed by the Health and Human
Services Commission.

We recognize the CHIP program is still a young program whose complexities
have yet to be completely understood.  We know it can be improved in many
aspects and will dedicate ourselves to helping identify those improvements.


Texas Children's Hospital Will Continue to Care for CHIP Children

Once again, let me repeat that Texas Children's Health Plan is negotiating
with the Health and Human Services Commission in good faith to remain a
provider in the CHIP program.

However, if the Texas Children's Health Plan is unable to reach an
economically viable settlement on appropriate premiums to cover the care of
our very sick CHIP members, Texas Children's Hospital will still care for
them if they require treatment or hospitalization.

Because above all, we remain steadfast to our mission of providing the
finest possible pediatric patient care to any child who needs us.

Thank you very much for your continued support.

Mr. Lay and Dave Delainey:
 
Since, I was terminated from Enron Energy Service's on  Friday, November 16, 2001 before the Thanksgiving holiday and did  not received a check on November 30, 2001.    
 
Please advise when I will receive my vacation owe to me of  73 hours, and when I will receive my severance?   Especially  since I was terminated from my job before Enron  officially declared bankruptcy.   
 
Ashley Kerr, HR Specialist replied via  email stating that;  Per the HR Service Connection the process of paying vacation out  30 days later is to ensure that any outstanding balances owed by the employee  can be taken care of (for i.e. - any Energizer charges you have in November will  be taken out of you vacation on 12/15.)  
 
But it was not  what Ms Kerr, HR Specialist outlined in her handwriting the day I  was terminated on November 16, 2001.  She explained and outlined the dates of what amount I would  be receiving on the payroll of November 30, 2001, December 15,   December 31, 2001 and on January 31, 2001.
 
Didn't you all received a check  on November 30th?  I hope that  Fastow and Skilling didn't received any kind of payment on November  30, 2001 from Enron's payroll.  
 
I await for your response, so that I may take care  of my bills.
 
Thanks,

  <content name="title" action="cluster">Conflict of Interest</content>
  <content type="text" name="message">
Dear Mr. Lay,

Thank you for your email message. I imagine you are quite disenchanted with
India-specific issues, and in light of your staggering responsibilities, may
choose to spend little time on this email. I have enormous respect for you
as a leader. As such, I write to appeal to your finer sensibilities, and to
point out simple errors in the way the matter was probably explained to you,
and that which is evident in the email below. This explanation is important
to me for two reasons: (i) The size of the outstanding bonus is material to
me (ii) I do not wish for Enron to consider that there were any conflict of
interest issues during the course of my employment.

Conflict of Interest:
1. I had informed the entire senior management team of Enron India of the
investments I wanted to make in the internet companies, and of Global
Telesystems' role therein. I informed my CEO Sanjay Bhatnagar, my COO Wade
Cline, and my General Counsel Sandeep Katwala prior to my investments. From
time to time, my internet investment was joked about, talked about, and
discussed informally and openly  in senior management meetings, e.g. the PRC
meetings, strategy reviews etc. Furthermore, at the time I was starting the
companies, I had even sought the assistance of the GC in identifying outside
lawyers who could assist me in establishing complex cross-border legal
structures. I believe the three gentlemen I have mentioned will confirm this
point.

2. When Enron India's Broadband venture was merged with EBS Houston, the new
Houston based management did not know about my investment. This was quite
understandable, since there was little or no interaction between the two
groups prior to the merger. They asked for a full explanation, and I did so
through the process established by Kevin Hannon and Ken Rice: an inquiry by
Rob Walls. Furthermore, I offered to Rob Walls that if they felt there were
any perceived conflicts of interest, I would be willing to clear them in any
way as suggested by Houston. This would even include selling my investments
at a loss. My commitment to Enron was paramount.


At all times I maintained complete transparency on my investments. I
informed about them to everyone, from my administrative assistant to my CEO.
At the discretion of the management (Sanjay Bhatnagar was my manager for
2000, the year for which the bonus was to be paid), the amount decided was $
85,000. But when Sanjay Bhatnagar decided to leave Enron in early January
2001, Kevin Hannon terminated my employment on January 24. 2001. The
decision to not pay the bonus was made in retrospect by people who were not
my managers for the year in question, and was little else but punitive.
Indeed, Ken Rice and Rob Walls admitted in subsequent conversations to
Sanjay Bhatnagar that  there was no conflict of interest, but some action
had to be appear to be taken.

I sincerely hope the unpleasantness surrounding the Indian government's
dealings with Enron, as well as incomplete information that may have been
submitted to you by Kevin Hannon will not prejudice your decision in this
matter. May I request that the issue of the Bonus be reconsidered.

With warm regards and best wishes for your new role,

Annat Jain

Dear Mr. Jain:

Thank you for your email messages.  Prior to your termination, this
matter was reviewed by several members of Enron's Senior management
team, including Jeff Skilling and Kevin Hannon, two members of Enron's
Corporate Policy Committee.  I learned that although you were employed
at Enron India throughout calendar year 2000, there were significant
conflict of interest issues surrounding your involvement, while an Enron
employee, with two Internet companies and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Global Telecom.  As a result, Senior management determined that it would
be in the best interests of all parties to terminate the employment
relationship.

Upon your termination of employment, you were entitled to severance
under the Enron Corp. Severance Pay Plan.  However, the payment of
bonuses to employees is at the discretion of management and your
management team in place at the time of your termination determined, in
its discretion, not to pay a bonus to you.

During the course of your employment with Enron, your contributions were
recognized.  I wish you well in your future endeavors.

Very truly yours,


Kenneth L. Lay"

quit ?? because of family ... BS. Over the past ten
years i have worked at
Enron as a computer contractor in payroll and i saw
the outlandish executive bonuses and money to the
islands.  I hope you get justly fined and sent to
prison for the fraud you have committed. The few
shares
of enron i have left are not worth the paper they are
printed on.....i also saw all the stock options you
and the board have excersied over thats few years 100s
of million dollars what a shame ...
  When you opted to replace the oracle Payroll with
SAP I new you were loosing your mind ....

all the great people that made you now have to find a
job replace their retirement and hope for the best.

I hope we never meet ...

  <content name="title" action="cluster">ENRON SITUATION</content>
  <content type="text" name="message">Mr. Lay,
 
I have been with Enron for 33 years. I have found these years to have been interesting, to say the least, and have seen many changes during this time. I am proud to be part of an aggressive, growing company. And I have always had a high regard for the people driving the company.
 
I am now 60 years of age and I have been contemplating retirement and "pursuing other interests" as they say, with my remaining years. Imagine my despair at the state of affairs Enron has fallen to through what appears to be gross mismanagement. What was once envisioned as "those comfortable golden years" are now simply smoke. And after giving many of my years to this company it is devastating. It is hard for me to understand how this could happen without the knowledge of those of you at the head of the company, in my mind it was a "look the other way" situation without concern for anyone but yourselves and all that money for the fancy house, fancy cars, travel, etc. 
 
I will never understand everything that took place and why. I am certainly not alone in these feelings. But I would hope that Jeff Skilling, Andy Fastow and others involved in this travesty have as much trouble sleeping at night as I do.

  <content name="title" action="cluster">Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy</content>
  <content type="text" name="message">Mr Lay - If you really think that this sale creates a "great opportunity" for shareholders then you are more out of touch with reality than I previously thought (unless you were referring to Dynegy shareholders). Under your "leadership" the shareholders have been devastated, employees have lost their retirements, college funds have been desiminated and reputations have been ruined, including your own. 

While I applaud your forgoing of the $60 million dollar payment I suspect having taken it would have only added to outrage and probably weakend your position in forthcoming lawsuits and don't feel that it was as self efacing as you have lead us to believe . Under your direction Enron has promoted bafoons, charletons and incompetents to the highest management ranks.  You personally did everything imaginable to lose the confidence of the investment community, in my opinion. This has got to be the financial disaster of the decade, all under your direction.

You said Jeff Skilling left for "personal reasons" and there were not hidden financial problems. You told us you were becoming more transparent in financial disclosures and then tried to slip a $1.2 Billion dollar equity reduction by us. The list goes on and on. Why should we believe you now.

One more thing Mr. Lay. I suggest  take the listing of  "executive awards" off the internet site. I suspect new "awards" will be coming out soon. And please don't waste your time sending me self serving "feel good" memos anymore. I finally caught on to you.

Ken Lay - Office of the Chairman

Subject:	Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at &lt;http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com &lt;mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.


Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.

The attached  "Rough &amp; Tumble" is an electronic clipping service targeted at California  politicos and policy wonks.  It carried the LA Times version of the Lockyer  comments a couple days ago.  Today, it has the NY Times article on Ken  Lay.  It's pretty clear that in the near-term, Enron and it's  leadership are at risk of being engulfed in a political firestorm  which bounces from coast to coast, gaining strength each step of the  way.  
 
However, it  is the long-term challenge that draws my attention.  From my research  to date, I am left with the strong impression that the Enron's capacity  for acquiring, distilling and assessing business information is much  stronger than it's abilities with public policy information.  
 
Ken Lay,  you and your team have shaped a innovative and entrepreneurial  company rooted in agile arbitrage of business knowledge.  Like  Goldman Sachs, it is hard for the "man on the street" to understand  precisely what Enron does.  However, because of your presence in  businesses that play out daily in homes, schools and small  businesses, Enron will be scrutinized in a way the Goldman couldn't imagine  in it's worst nightmares.
 
From my  perspective, the success of Enron's business model demands a sure  footing in both business and public policy.  Going  forward, these two areas of expertise need  become intertwined to assure the success of the highly  sophisticated, ethical, innovative and insightful global corporation  known as Enron.
 
I would like  to help you succeed with this challenge.  I look forward to our  discussions.

Companies pushed up price of power -- After months of investigation,  state regulators say they have evidence suggesting that power companies have  deliberately driven up wholesale electricity prices. Now they must decide  whether those companies have done anything illegal. State Attorney General Bill  Lockyer said Thursday he believes the evidence ``strongly suggests'' power  companies acted illegally to drive up prices. He has said that he would love to  put top energy executives in jail. Brandon  Bailey and Chris O'Brien in the San Jose  Mercury  -- 5/25/01 
Davis blackout warnings -- a significant policy change aimed  at minimizing business and consumer disruptions, Gov. Gray Davis ordered state  officials Thursday to enact a three-tier blackout warning system. Forecasts of  blackouts will be issued 48 hours beforehand, Davis said. General areas will be  identified in warnings issued 24 hours before likely outages. Precise locations  will be announced an hour before the power is cut, he said. Dan Morain and Nancy  Vogel in the Los Angeles  Times  Greg Lucas and Lynda Gledhill in the San  Francisco Chronicle  Noam Levey and  Dion Nissenbaum in the San Jose  Mercury  John Hill in the Sacramento  Bee  Ed Mendel in the San  Diego Union  Robert Garrett in the Riverside  Press  Michael Coit in the Santa Rosa Press   -- 5/25/01 
Davis' popularity plunges in poll -- With California's energy crisis  mounting, Democratic Gov. Gray Davis has suffered a precipitous fall in his job  approval rating and image among state residents, according to a Field Poll  released yesterday. For the first time since his November 1998 election, more  Californians have an unfavorable view of Davis' performance than favorable.  Carla Marinucci in the San  Francisco Chronicle  Hallye Jordan in the  San Jose  Mercury  John Marelius in the San  Diego Union  -- 5/25/01 
Poll puts Riordan, Davis in tight race -- Californians' assessment of Gov.  Gray Davis has plummeted drastically as he has struggled to handle the state  energy crisis, placing outgoing Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan in a virtual  dead heat with him for the 2002 governor's race, according to a Field Poll  released Thursday. Though Riordan has given no clear indication that he intends  to run for governor, 42 percent of registered voters said they would support the  Republican mayor should he challenge Davis, the Democratic incumbent.  Forty-three percent said they would vote for Davis. Emily  Bazar in the Sacramento  Bee  -- 5/25/01 
California to gain from GOP's loss -- A single party switch in the Senate  on Thursday handed California's Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara  Boxer new clout with key leadership roles likely on issues ranging from military  base closings to environmental cleanups. Vermont Sen. James Jeffords'  announcement that he was quitting the Republican Party to be an independent  affiliated with Democrats set up a takeover in which the Democrats, with a de  facto 51-49 majority, will assume all Senate leadership posts and committee  chairs. Bill Hillburg in the Los Angeles  Daily News  -- 5/25/01 
PUC and 'baseline' rates -- Nine days after structuring the  largest electricity rate increase in California history, state regulators on  Thursday launched a reexamination of the unpopular baselines used to determine  how much each residential customer will pay. If the indicators are revised  upward, as most expect, that would grant some customers relief from the rate  hike but could necessitate future ones to generate enough revenue for power  purchases. Tim Reiterman in the Los Angeles  Times  Michael Bazeley in the San Jose  Mercury  Carrie Peyton in the Sacramento  Bee  -- 5/25/01 
Enron Bush  -- Curtis H?bert Jr., Washington's top electricity regulator, said he had barely  settled into his new job this year when he had an unsettling telephone  conversation with Kenneth L. Lay, the head of the nation's largest electricity  trader, the Enron Corporation. Mr. H?bert, chairman of the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission, said that Mr. Lay, a close friend of President Bush's,  offered him a deal: If he changed his views on electricity deregulation, Enron  would continue to support him in his new job. Lowell  Bergman and Jeff Gerth in the New York Times   -- 5/25/01 
Lockyer comes out swinging at oilman Davis has plenty of company in  depths of poll --  The reaction from Gov. Gray Davis' camp to yesterday's poll showing him in the  dumper was quick and blunt. "Tell me something I don't already know," adviser  Paul Maslin said after being hit with the news that the latest Field Poll showed  Davis' job rating down 18 points since January. "None of this is news to us,"  Maslin said. Matier &amp; Ross in the San  Francisco Chronicle  -- 5/25/01 
Water and power -- The California Public Utilities Commission authorized an increase in  American States Water Co.'s rates at the Bear Valley Electric customer service  area of its Southern California Water Co. unit to recover $2.4 million in  deferred electric power costs. The amount will be recovered from customers over  a five-year period. Sam Favate; Dow  Jones Newswires  -- 5/25/01 
Muni power  -- Gov. Davis said he received a pledge Thursday from municipal utility  officials that their agencies will sell excess power to the state at prices much  lower than in the past. Despite simmering resentment at subjecting their  customers to rolling blackouts, the muni officials promised Davis they will keep  cooperating with the state. Municipal utility customers, including those in the  Modesto, Turlock and Merced irrigation districts, will continue to face power  blackouts, officials said afterward. Jim  Miller in the Modesto Bee   -- 5/25/01 
Edison merit raises -- Southern California Edison, which  is struggling to stay out of bankruptcy, will hand out $19 million in merit  raises to its 12,000 employees today, but top executives will forgo the raises  because of the company's financial woes. Edison has doled out hefty merit raises  in the past. But this year, the company will pay the minimum under its variable  compensation program, which rewards employees for meeting certain company goals.  Kate Berry in the Orange County  Register  -- 5/25/01
Cities with own utilities ask FERC to bar blackouts -- More than 15 California cities  that have municipal utilities, including Anaheim, are asking federal regulators  to exempt them from electricity blackouts ordered by the state's Independent  System Operator. The city of Vernon was first to ask the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission to rule that the ISO cannot force it to participate in  California's rolling blackouts to serve demand in other areas. Vernon's utility  argued that it was ridiculous to subject its customers to blackouts when it had  enough power to keep the lights on. Amy Strahan  Butler in the Orange County  Register  -- 5/25/01 
Utility tax windfall -- As electricity rates rise,  consumers will get hit with a double whammy because of an obscure utility bill  tax that many California cities have quietly been collecting for years. A member  of the state Board of Equalization charges that some cities will reap windfalls  from the utility user tax, and he is backing a grass-roots movement to slash or  repeal it. Few local governments are hurrying to forfeit the money, saying that  they need it to pay their own higher energy bills. Wendy  Thermos in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
An air of discontent over diesel backups -- Gov. Gray Davis said yesterday  that he may ask companies to run their emergency generators during Stage 3  electricity alerts as a way to stave off blackouts. And when blackouts do occur,  thousands of tractor-trailer-size generators will whir to life, powering  elevators and lights, hospital equipment, even assembly lines. But that prospect  has created major concerns. Most of those industrial- strength generators run on  diesel oil, a highly polluting fuel. Because they were intended for emergency  use, generators have escaped most environmental regulations. What's more, they  are likely to be called into service on the hottest, smoggiest days of the year.  Carolyn Said in the San  Francisco Chronicle  -- 5/25/01 
Power price controls -- The House Energy and Commerce  Committee delayed consideration of a major energy bill Thursday as Republicans  and Democrats met privately to explore a possible compromise placing price  controls on soaring wholesale electric rates on the West Coast. The negotiations  hinted at a possible watershed change in the Republicans' staunch opposition to  price controls. An earlier effort to include such controls in the bill turned  contentious and was defeated on a mostly partisan vote in subcommittee. Les Blumenthal in the Sacramento  Bee  -- 5/25/01 
For seniors, the heat can kill, doctors warn -- As summer slouches toward  Sacramento amid a drumbeat of calls to conserve electricity, doctors and  advocates for the elderly are sounding a counter-theme. Heat can kill. And most  often, it kills seniors. Year after year, heat waves around the United States  are deadlier than hurricanes or floods, tornadoes or earthquakes, according to  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Carrie Peyton and Nancy Weaver  Teichert in the Sacramento  Bee  -- 5/25/01 
Outages could be fatal for disabled -- Around the clock, an electric  pump supplies supplementary oxygen to 66-year-old Benny Pritchett's diseased  lungs. Pritchett worries that a rolling blackout might kill him. "The  electricity goes out, I'm a dead man," said the San Bernardino apartment dweller  and former chain-smoker. "I've got a (back-up) oxygen tank. It lasts two hours.  When it runs out, I'm dead." Rolling blackouts aren't expected to last much more  than an hour, say Southern California Edison officials, but their Web site  recommends that any customer dependent on electrically operated life-support  equipment buy an emergency generator. Richard  Brooks in the Riverside  Press  -- 5/25/01 
Gasoline prices -- Average gasoline prices statewide are nearly $2 a gallon, and the Los  Angeles region has once again been dubbed the nation's hub of traffic  congestion. So, what's a good Southern Californian to do? Plan a road trip.  Hugo Martin in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
Offshore drilling -- A federal advisory panel Thursday urged the Bush administration to  identify the five most promising areas to drill for natural gas in coastal  waters off California and other states, which have been off limits to drilling  for nearly 20 years. Citing the nation's unmet energy needs, the advisory group  to Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton suggested that locating the top reservoirs  of natural gas would help determine if there "are grounds and support for a  limited lifting of" moratoriums on offshore drilling. The ban now covers 610  million acres of ocean off the Pacific, Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Kenneth Weiss in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
Judge demands straight answers from El Paso Corp. -- An irate judge threatened  yesterday to subpoena the president of a Texas energy firm accused of  manipulating California natural gas prices, saying he couldn't get straight  answers out of another high-ranking company executive. The eruption by Curtis  Wagner Jr., the administrative law judge presiding over a federal probe of  alleged market manipulation by El Paso Corp., prompted the company to schedule  voluntary testimony by President William Wise today in Washington, D.C. Bernadette Tansey in the San  Francisco Chronicle  -- 5/25/01 
El Paso executive and collusion -- The head of a Texas energy  conglomerate personally endorsed a deal between two subsidiaries accused of  manipulating the natural gas market in Southern California to drive up prices, a  senior official of the firm testified Thursday. The testimony in a trial-like  hearing before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission raised questions about  whether top officials of Houston-based El Paso Corp. violated FERC rules  requiring arm's-length dealings within a corporate family. The admission by El  Paso executive Ralph Eads marked a shift from his previous testimony and was  elicited through sharp questioning by an angry judge who threatened to subpoena  Eads' boss. Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
Riverside no blackouts -- Southern California Edison won't  immediately challenge Riverside's decision against using rolling blackouts to  save energy this summer, a spokesman said Thursday. Edison doesn't care how the  city of Riverside curtails its energy use as long as the city makes the required  cuts during a statewide power shortage, Edison spokesman Steve Hansen said.  Dan Lee in the Riverside  Press  -- 5/25/01 
Energy crisis hits muni bonds -- Investors fled the California  municipal bond market last month, taking with them a net $3.5 billion, their  departure prompted in part by the state's energy crisis and taxes, a fund  analysis firm said Thursday. The withdrawals in April marked the worst such  outflow in years, and it comes as the state is preparing this August to issue a  record $13.4 billion in bonds to bail out utilities. Loretta Kalb in the Sacramento Bee   -- 5/25/01 
With a perfectly negative crisis record, Davis desperate for a  win -- So far, Gov. Gray Davis has amassed an unblemished record in  his handling of the energy crisis. Not one major aspect of the situation has  moved in the positive direction Davis said -- and clearly hoped -- it would, to  wit: Dan Walters in the Sacramento  Bee  -- 5/25/01 
Hot days don't cut the power -- A combination of factors kept the  state's beleaguered system out of the red this time. The heat wave didn't hit  all areas of the state at the same time, and cooler weather in the Pacific  Northwest got power flowing from that region to California again. Also, there  have been no new power-plant malfunctions, and many of the smaller generating  facilities that were AWOL a few weeks ago, when the last blackouts hit, are  operating again. A huge potential contributor to blackout avoidance -- but one  that's difficult to quantify -- is conservation. Jack  Katzanek in the Riverside  Press  -- 5/25/01 
Long Beach Boeing layoffs -- Reflecting a sagging market for  100-seat jetliners, the Boeing Co. will lay off about 600 employees this year at  its commercial factory in Long Beach, the company confirmed Thursday. That  decision followed an internal study by Boeing that was completed earlier this  year, said spokesman Warren Lamb, who did not elaborate. Ian Hanigan in the Long Beach Press  --  5/25/01 
Hahn --  His job is to both prosecute and defend. And with that tricky mandate, Los  Angeles City Atty. James Kenneth Hahn for 16 years has led a law office that, in  sheer numbers, would rank among the biggest in the country. With some 450  attorneys, responsibility for both criminal and civil cases, and an annual  budget of $70 million, the office, like the city it serves, is big, diverse,  complex. But a review of Hahn's record suggests that his performance has been  mixed--deliberate and plodding, pragmatic and obstinate. Greg Krikorian and Patrick  McGreevey in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
Villaraigosa and Hahn and housing -- It doesn't fire up voters like a  stump speech on crime, schools or traffic congestion. But the sheer magnitude of  the city's housing shortage has placed it squarely--albeit quietly--on the  agendas of both candidates running for mayor of Los Angeles. Eight years of a  widely criticized lack of mayoral attention to the housing problem combined with  a high concentration of low-wage workers has earned Los Angeles a reputation as  one of the most unaffordable, overcrowded metropolitan centers in the country,  plagued by low home ownership rates and slum conditions. Lee Romney in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
Villaraigosa and Hahn annd crime and gangs -- Mayoral candidates Antonio  Villaraigosa and City Attorney James Hahn continued Thursday to compare their  plans to deal with crime as they near the June 5 runoff election. Hahn, filing  papers in court to seek injunctions against two Wilmington gangs, touted his  efforts over the past several years to control gang activity throughout the  city. "The root of the violence is drugs and ... for turf and control," Hahn  said of the two gangs -- but which, he added, applies to most gangs in the city.  Rick Orlov in the Los Angeles  Daily News  -- 5/25/01 
Dean Andal  -- State Board of Equalization member Dean Andal is expected to announce today  that he plans to run for state controller next year. The 41-year-old Republican  from Stockton said he will run on a platform that includes lowering utility  taxes paid by residents and businesses in Los Angeles, which are 10% and 12.5%,  respectively. The story is in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
Jim Rogan  -- President Bush on Thursday nominated former Congressman James Rogan to be  undersecretary of commerce for intellectual property and director of the U.S.  Trademark Office. The job pays $130,200 a year. Bush's selection of Rogan, which  will require confirmation by the Senate, could be a positive sign for Hollywood,  which has been lobbying for increased enforcement of copyright laws, including a  crackdown on Internet piracy. Bill Hillburg in  the Los  Angeles Daily News  -- 5/25/01 
Living wage -- While attorneys speculated on the constitutionality of Santa Monica's  newly approved living wage law, hotel housekeeper Blanca Mendez was just hoping  Thursday that she can benefit if a raise to $10.50 an hour goes into effect next  summer at large downtown and beach-side businesses. "It would be fantastic,"  said Mendez, who now earns $8.50 an hour after seven years at the Streamline  Moderne-style Shangri-La Hotel near the ocean. "The economy is very difficult;  everything is getting expensive, like gas, like energy." Oscar Johnson and Ofelia  Casillas in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
9 tribes' casino plans put on hold -- Gov. Gray Davis won't approve any  more agreements with Indian tribes to allow casinos until the federal courts  resolve a legal challenge to California's Indian gaming law. So far, the  governor's moratorium on new Indian gaming compacts, announced in a letter to  nine California tribes, doesn't appear to affect three Sonoma County tribes that  have announced plans for casinos. But it could delay the progress of the nine  other tribes that have asked the governor to negotiate gaming agreements,  including the Round Valley tribe in Mendocino County. Steve Hart in the Santa Rosa Press   -- 5/25/01 
Charity foundations growth -- California's charitable  foundation assets--which were relatively modest as recently as two decades  ago--are now growing at a rate faster than those in the rest of the country,  according to a study by the new USC Center on Philanthropy and Public Policy. In  1978, California held 8% of national foundation assets; in 1998 it accounted for  14%, the study said. During the same period, the state's share of foundation  grants grew from 7% to 11% of total giving nationwide, it said. "California is  catching up and jumping forward," said Marcia K. Sharp, a research fellow at the  USC Center on Philanthropy and Public Policy, and a co-author of the study.  Anne-Marie O'Connor in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
Documents seized in S.F. minority contract probe are  inadmissible -- In a  potential blow to prosecutors, a U.S. judge said that federal investigators  violated a San Francisco city official's privacy rights when they searched her  office looking for evidence of fraud in a city minority contracting program. The  FBI seized hundreds of pages of records from the San Francisco Human Rights  Commission office of chief contract compliance officer Zula Jones in August  1999. Chuck Finnie and Lance Williams in the San  Francisco Chronicle  -- 5/25/01 
Feinstein fast-tracks water storage plans -- California can't forestall a  water crisis without building more storage facilities, Sen. Dianne Feinstein  said yesterday in responding to environmental critics of her bill to reauthorize  the CalFed ecosystem restoration program. Eric Brazil in the San  Francisco Chronicle  Michael Gardner in the  San  Diego Union  -- 5/25/01 
Californians' recycling efforts hit skids -- Californians are recycling a  lower percentage of redeemable plastic, glass and aluminum beverage containers  than they have in more than a decade, the state Department of Conservation  reported Thursday. While officials note the recycling drop is partially due to  an increasing number of products available for redemption, they also point to  research suggesting consumers' habits may be slipping. Ed  Fletcher in the Sacramento  Bee  -- 5/25/01 
UC admissions policy -- A UC Berkeley request to be  exempted from a University of California admissions policy is creating concern  among administrators and faculty who object to looking at one campus in  isolation. Instead, they said, the Berkeley request probably should be folded  into a systemwide review of admissions already under way. Tanya Schevitz in the San  Francisco Chronicle  -- 5/25/01 
Irvine cash crop: business -- Irvine One of the largest  commercial developments in the county could be built in the next five to seven  years, replacing checkered fields of strawberries and other crops. The 670 acres  of fields and a scattering of industrial buildings just outside Irvine's  northeastern border is large enough to host 12 Disneylands, but The Irvine Co.  has other plans. Laura Corbin, Jennifer Hieger  and Elizabeth Aguilera in the Orange County  Register  -- 5/25/01 
Like a Rolling Tone -- It looked like a scene from the  hotel karaoke lounge, where the microphone-hogging guy won't stop belting Tom  Jones tunes and a few cocktail-sipping patrons keep their eyes glued to their  drinks in embarrassment. But it was official state business at the state Capitol  on Thursday when members of the Assembly attempted to pay tribute to Bob Dylan  on his 60th birthday by feebly singing along with his 1973 recording of "Forever  Young." Lesli A. Maxwell in the Fresno  Bee  -- 5/25/01 
Joe Lockhart -- Barely six months after joining Oracle Corp. as a communications  consultant to chief executive Larry Ellison, former White House press secretary  Joe Lockhart has left the database software firm. Both sides yesterday denied a  rift between the two men and blamed Lockhart's frequent trips from his home in  Washington, D.C., to Oracle's Redwood Shores headquarters for the departure.  Kelly Zito in the San  Francisco Chronicle  -- 5/25/01 More..

  <content type="text" name="message">Gentlemen:

There was a discussion at the Executive Committee meeting last week
regarding a bylaw change.  Eliminate existing Bylaw 9 and change it to read
that "Members will retain Graduate status for only as long a period as they
held Active membership or until normal council retirement at age 72,
whichever occurs first."

The following members would be immediately affected by the proposed change
and would leave the council:  Sam Armacost, Percy Barnevik, Art Blank,
Michael Bonsignore, Ed Budd, Ed Carpenter, David Coulter, Walter Forbes, Jim
Johnson, Tim Koogle, Jack Krol, Paul Lego, Jan Leschly, Dick McCormick,
Eckhard Pfeiffer, Rick Scott, Pete Silas, Jeff Skilling, Bob Stempel, Rick
Thoman, John Walter, Dennis Weatherstone and Bob Winters.

The mandatory retirement provision affects an additional 49 members.  In
summary, we currently have 115 Active members and would be reducing the
Graduate members from 149 to 77.  Frankly, a more dramatic change than I
thought.  Any thoughts?

Subject:	Sucker punch



Mr. Lay
Have you ever been sucker punched?  In case you haven't let me describe it to you.  First you are stunned and shocked because you didn't see it coming.  Then you realize that you can't breath because the wind has been knocked out of you.  Then you get mad when it sinks in that something like this could have happened to you.  Well Ken!  The employee's of Enron know what it is like because it just happened to us. 
     You asked one thing of the people that work for you.  To make Enron the worlds leading energy company.  We gave that to you and what did we get in return?  
     I can handle a few bad investments and a downturn in the economy affecting the price of our stock.  What I can't handle is everything else that we are reading about in the national news every day.
     Every month in our team meetings we go over Enrons vision and values and describe what each one means to us.  Little did we know that we were the only ones paying attention to what they stood for. Can you tell me what each one means to you right now.  RESPECT?    INTEGRITY?    COMMUNICATION?    EXCELLENCE?   
     I am trying to keep my head up when people ask me what happened but it is getting harder all the time.  I have stopped trying to defend you and the others that are involved.  
     I have been proud to work for this company for 21 years and now because of something out of my control it is all gone.  You made more in 1 year then I have made in my career with Enron.  You decided that you wouldn't take that 60 million dollars if  the merger with Dynegy didn't go through.  What about my 600 thousand dollars that I have saved for the last 21 years.  I have watched it's value drop to less the two thousand.  Did I have a choice?  Yes I could have sold off some of my stock, but why would I do that when Skilling was telling us it would be over 100 dollars by now.
One other feeling you will never realize is After 21 years I was standing at the end of the rainbow just to watch my pot of gold snatched away from me by the very people I trusted the most.

Mr. Skilling,

Joannie suggested I email you a note regarding KPMG's tax solutions
developed specifically for the executive who is exiting, exercising stock
options, monitizing stock, and recognizing gain. We work in concert with
your financial advisors and have forged many relationships with
institutions, investors and brokers  to bring cutting edge tax ideas
together. KPMG's Personal Financial Planning is dedicated to developing tax
solutions for those interested in deferral, minimization , and mitigation of
personal income tax.

The attachment gives a brief description of some of our Innovative
Strategies.

As a side note,  I am sure you have know the Lay Family and Sharon and JT
have been friends of my parents and my husband and I for years through
sailing at the Yacht Club at Lakewood and HYC.

I do hope you consider allowing me and my partners a few minutes of your
time, to share our Tax ideas with you. If so, have Joannie call me at my
numbers below.

Best Wishes

FYI - Strong and colorful words  from a powerful man.
 
Given Lockyer's abilities,  position and and ambition, I would advise building bridges and mending fences  while this is still at the taunting stage.  He wants your  attention.  Knowing him, I'd say that a direct and friendly  call from you or Ken today, followed by a meeting would go a long  way.

Gen. Bill  Lockyer this week suggested the chairman of a Houston-based power company  should be locked in a prison cell with an amorous, tattooed inmate named  Spike.       Lockyer, who is investigating  whether energy firms have manipulated prices on the wholesale electricity  market, made the comment in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that  appeared Tuesday.       "I would love to  personally escort [Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth] Lay to an 8-by-10 cell  that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi my name is Spike,  honey,' " Lockyer said.       Enron spokesman  Mark Palmer called the comment "counterproductive rhetoric" that "does not  merit a response."       But other industry  representatives denounced the remark as "outrageous," especially because  neither Lockyer's office nor any investigative panel has filed charges  against Enron or other companies.       "You'd  expect that the state's chief legal counsel would file charges first and  make public statements second," said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power  Trading Forum, an association of energy producers and traders. "We're very  disappointed with his choice of words, which don't exactly fit the profile  of his office."       In an interview Tuesday,  Lockyer said he decided to "ratchet up" the commentary to "put [energy  companies] on notice" that "we are not afraid of them and have the will to  prosecute."       "What I'm trying to do is  let these economic buccaneers understand that if we catch them, they're  going to be prosecuted," Lockyer said. "Just because they're  multimillionaires and run big corporations, it doesn't provide them with  immunity."       The attorney general is  investigating whether power company officials tried to maximize profits  through illegal manipulation of prices on the wholesale energy market.  Several panels, including a state Senate committee and the California  Public Utilities Commission, are conducting similar probes.        On Tuesday, Lockyer announced that three  power companies have agreed to turn over documents subpoenaed months ago  by his investigators. The attorney general went to court to obtain the  documents after the companies failed to meet a March 19 deadline to hand  them over.       Lockyer said the forthcoming  documents would help his office as it sifts through mountains of evidence  in search of possible violations of antitrust or unfair business practice  laws.       "Evidence is accumulating that  certainly infers illegal activity," Lockyer said. "But we need to make  sure it's compelling and clear enough that you can convince a jury."        Lockyer said he singled out Enron's  chairman because the Houston company is the world's largest energy trader.        At least one observer found Lockyer's  comments refreshingly candid. Harry Snyder, a senior advocate of Consumers  Union, said, "Let Lockyer be Lockyer."  * * *      Times staff writer Dan  Morain contributed to this story.

  <content type="text" name="message">Jeffrey,

During the past 12 years Noble Systems Corporation has moved to the forefront in providing the world's best "total solution" value in call center and customer contact technology.  10,000+ agents at more than 500 client installations in 7 countries, conduct business from feature-rich Noble Systems workstations.  Over 2 million customer calls are managed every day through our full spectrum of ACD, Predictive Dialing, Blended Call Processing, Digital Recording, and CRM systems.  With corporate headquarters in Atlanta, Noble Systems also has offices in the United Kingdom, France, and Australia to manage the rapidly growing international demand for our unique solutions.
N
 oble Systems is part of the SR. Teleperformance group, a $700+ Million Teleservices conglomerate with over 120 call centers in more than 30 countries.  This business relationship financially empowers Noble Systems to aggressively pursue the most complex contact center applications on a global basis.  It also provides us with the largest research and development environment in the industry for testing new technology and software applications, within actual customer operations, prior to full-scale market release.

ATOMS
, our award winning call center automation system, is a fully open, highly customizable and scalable technology platform, utilizing the latest hardware, database system, and telephony technologies.  Robust functionality within ATOMS empowers clients to design sophisticated campaigns without programming, leverage real-time decision making tools, achieve ultimate agent productivity, increase agent retention, and maximize overall campaign performance and results.  These powerful capabilities place Noble Systems in the leadership position of providing the industry's most comprehensive and affordable customer interaction management solutions.

Our network-wide Graphical Manager workstation software is setting entirely new thresholds of effectiveness and productivity for managing agents and campaigns! The current release now enables you to include each agent's picture on your real time production displays. Our next release will enable you to lay out these agent icons on your management displays into the same floor plan as your center - depicting each agent where they are actually sitting.

Coming this week is another new release of our Dynamic Campaign Builder (DCB 2.6) which continues to set new standards in productivity. DCB is the realization of a dream in that non-programmers now quickly develop and implement complete contact applications. We hold the 2 day DCB training class every week!

We've also introduced two new sales promotions this week for new customers (see attachment).

If you have not done so recently, please check out our improved website at www.noblesys.com Among other enhancements, you will appreciate the new Search capability; simply enter keyword(s) and you can quickly get to the items of interest including the earlier press releases and customer success stories.

Jeffrey, if I can be of any assistance, please advise.

Jeff--nice to see you at the bike ride on Saturday, and  to meet you at the luncheon Monday honoring Jim Derrick. Thought you might be  interested in the report I prepared for people who pledged to MS in connection  with the bike ride over the weekend.
 
Several persons  who have either pledged, or are considering a pledge, to the National Multiple  Sclerosis Society have left messages or sent emails asking if I am still alive  after the MS150 charity bike ride held this past weekend. Others have asked for  a report of my experience. I am alive and sore. If you are not interested in the  report, please delete this email.
 
First of all, for  those who have pledged or already sent you checks payable to the National  Multiple Sclerosis Society,  thanks is an inadequate word.  Remember  that you are helping colleagues and others, and perhaps yourself with your  contributions.
 
This bike ride charity event turned out to be a story  unlike anything I ever expected.
 
Here is my story, if  you are interested:
 
BASIC  FACTS:
 
1.  I did show  up for the bike ride (5:30 am Saturday).
 
2.  I did start  the bike ride (7:10 am) with approximately 9400 bikers in the largest charity  bike ride in the country.
 
3.  I did ride  my bike across the finish line in Austin the following day, some 199 miles down  the road..
 
4.  I did  either ride my bike, or push it up several hills, for approx. 182 miles of the  199 mile route.
 
5.  I crossed  the finish line in Austin only a few minutes before the deadline of 6:00 pm  on Sunday.
 
6.  I ended up  meeting in one way or another almost every biker on the trip.  That  resulted from the fact that I started at almost the very front of the pack of  9400 bike riders, and was passed by nearly all of them before I reached  Austin.
 
7.  I am  extremely pleased to have participated in the event.  I don't have the time  to participate in such events very often, and I was fortunate to have a schedule  which opened up just in time for me to enter this  event.
 
 
RANDOM GENERAL  OBSERVATIONS:
 
1.  The charity  event title, "MS150", is a misnomer.  When I signed up for this event, I  understood the "150" part of the event title to refer to the mileage between  Houston and Austin. I was wrong.  The "150" I now understand to mean the  approximate number of blisters to be found on one's posterior when a biker  crosses the finish line.  
 
2.  I have  driven from Houston to Austin many times in the past.  There are routes  between the two cities that are generally flat with hills of a gentle  grade.  We took a different route.
 
3.  The ride  from Houston to Austin by car is about 160 miles. The route we took was almost  40 miles further.  The bike ride route displayed on a map appeared  similar to that which you might expect to be drawn by asking an Aggie to find  the shortest distance between two points.
 
4.  Road kill  if far more attractive from a car than from a bike.
 
5.  The chicken  ranch in LaGrange is long gone, but the spirit lingers.  The  LaGrange fair gounds was the venue for dinner and lodging at the end of the  first day of biking. We were welcomed there by the local Rotary Club  volunteers with a scrumptuous dinner of barbecued chicken and salad with ranch  dressing.  I laughed out loud when I saw the meal being served, and  wondered whether the historical connection was  intentional. 
 
STRATEGY
 
I knew when I signed  up for this event that I had almost no chance of completing the ride which, at  the time I entered, I thought was only 150 miles.  I had not trained at all  for the bike ride, and was (and am) not physically fit and dont exercise as I  should.  The total extent of my bike riding during the year prior to  the event was when rode my mountain bike from my home to a  sporting goods store to buy supplies one week before the trip.  Round trip,  my "training" ride to the sporting goods store was about 3  miles.
 
I sufficiently  realistic to know that I needed a strategy to gain some advantage  to make up for the lack of althletic readiness.  I came up with what I  thought was the perfect solution. Before the race started, I looked for the  largest biker I could spot.  My plan was that if I rode my bike during  the ride immediately behind a very large person, I could draft that person  (Nascar style), and gain a considerable aerodynamic advantage.  I thought  it was a terrific idea and I figured that even if the large person had a slower  pace than I desired, the advantage would be apparent by the end of the  ride.  Luckily, I found just the person I was seeking---this person  appeared to be about 300-325 pounds--a body that would clear a nice swath  of air for me to follow.  When the race started, I maneuvered my bike and  pulled immediately behind the biker who was to be my air blocker.    For the first 5 minutes of the ride, my strategy worked great--I actually could  tell that my air resistance was considerable less when I was directly  behind this large person.  Then, the unexpected happened----my large person  biker turned on her afterburners and left me in the dust.  Never again on  this bike ride was I again able to catch and draft another  biker.
 
I needed a new  strategy---perhaps a tail wind, which did in fact materialize in spades,   but not before noon the second day of the ride.
 
 
THE RIDE IN  DETAIL
 
I signed up for this  event about two weeks in advance of the ride as a result of my schedule  opening up unexpectedly when it was previously heavily commited.  I  did it largely on  a lark, but the event took on new meaning when I  learned of close friends who have been stricken with MS after I started the fund  raising effort, which is a required part of participating as a  rider.
 
Iknew I was  out of shape and had been asked by friends if I had gone loco in even attempting  this strenuous activity.  I agreed that I could not keep up the normal pace  of younger and far more physically fit bikers.  So, I made a pledge to  myself.  No matter what, I was not going to overexert myself.  I would  establish a reasonable pace and not even get close to being winded.  I  succeeded in executing this plan until lunch on the first day of the  ride.
 
I kept a pace that  was clearly nonstrenous and I felt good about the ride for the first 4  hours or so, which was mostly level road.  I was very happy with the ride,  and was looking forward to the tasty box lunch that the announcer has  promised at the start of the day was waiting for every biker when we reached  Bellville, about 50 miles from Houston.  When I got to Bellville, I came to  realize that my pace, although not strenous, was substantially off the  mark.  With a box lunch prepared for over 9000 riders, there were only four  box lunches left when I arrived in Bellville. As I thought back, I  remembered being passed by many bikers.  I  did pass, by my count,  9 bikes before lunch as if they were standing still.  They were.   They all had flat tires.   I decided I needed to pick up the pace  at little after lunch.
 
I headed out after a  quick lunch to try to make up some time.  By around 2:00 to 3:00, I  was really getting tired and although still cautious about over exertion, I was  losing energy fast. I stopped at a pay phone booth in  a small town, and  called home. I told my 13 year old son William I did not think I would make it  much further.  But I wanted to go as far as I could.  I rode about 10  more miles, and was almost totally out of steam when I remember thinking  "I desparately need a long rest".  About that time, I looked up at  a road sign that said "Cemetery, next exit".  The symbolic connection  was compelling!  I decided it was time to take a rest--a temporary,  not a permanent, one.  I biked past the cemetery where I lay down in  some high grass along the road to catch my breath. The local chiggars and I  bonded almost immediately.  I then flagged down a "SAG" bus, designed  to pick up weary bikers, and got help loading first my bike, then my body, into  a van.  I remember telling the driver that I was "finished" and that I did  not think I could bike anymore for the rest of the way to Austin.  I was  extremely disappointed because I had gone only about 62 miles, and about 80% of  the donations pledged to me were based on distance traveled.  I concluded I  was destined to fall far short of my fundraising goal.
 
After traveling in  the van for about 15 miles, we came upon the entrance to a ranch of a  friend of mine that I had visited only a couple weeks ago. I asked the van  driver to let me out so that I could see if my friend was home.  I went to  visit the friend, but he was not at his ranch house, and I ended up spending  about an hour taking a nap while waiting for him.  I finally decided to  leave, and found that the rest had given me new strength.  I thought I  might be able to ride again.  To make a long story short, I rode for about  another 4 hours straight until it was total dark.  A van came and picked me  up on the highway and told me it was too dark to continue. I was only 3 miles  short of LaGrange, our stopover spot for the night, and the van carried me on to  this historic spot.
 
I had really been  looking forward to reaching LaGrange because I was a member of Team Enron, and  Enron's hospitality for its bike riders was by reputation, outstanding.   They had hired 40 messeuses to give massages to the Team Enron bikers, and a  dinner fit for a king would be waiting.  Unfortunately, by the time I  arrived at the LaGrange Fair Grounds, our accomodations for the evening, dinner  in the Enron tent was over and all the masseuses had vanished.  I finally  found a general meal service hosted by the local Rotarians who were serving  barbecued chicken, and a salad with ranch dressing.
 
Since I didnt enter  the bike event until less than two weeks before it started, Team Enron's private  tent was full and I was relegated to find sleeping space on my own.  I was  directed to a huge feedlot covered with a large tin roof, open air style (no  walls).   As I nestled in my sleeping bag under the big roof with  about 2000 other bikers, my senses told me that I was probably to sleep where a  cow going to market had probably slept only days before.  But I was dog  tired, simply wanted to sleep, and didnt have the energy to find less aeromatic,  alternative, accomodations.  
 
 
THE SECOND  DAY
 
 
I was told that  breakfast would be served at 530 am the next morning, and that the ride would  start at sunup, about 640 am.  I concluded that I could sleep until 6 am,  grab a quick bite, and still be at the starting gate by 640.  Needless to  say, I was happy with my plan to get as much sleep as possible.  I badly  needed the rest. My plan failed.
 
I did not take into  consideration that I was sleeping among a bunch of gung-ho superbikejocks.   About 4 am, some two hours before I planned to wake up, a large group of  overenenergetic-supercyclists arose and started doing side straddle hops,  stretching, and various exercises while making Monica Seles-like grunting  noises.  I was not amused.  There was no way to go back to sleep! The  five hours of sleep I managed on Saturday night was wholly  inadequate.
 
I was told that Day  2 of the bike ride was much more difficult than Day 1 because of the more hilly  route as we approached Austin.  To make a long story short,  I  actually gained strength on Day 2 as compared to Day 1. I actually learned some  technique for transferring power from my arms to my legs, and made it to Austin  on my own power without any motorized help of any kind.
 
The ride through the  hill country was spectacular.  Also, I did get a taste of ole country Texas  along the way. The bike route intentionally  meanders via remote roads through small towns in order to avoid heavy  highway traffic for the safety of the bikers.  As we passed through one  small town that I never heard of before, I looked up to see a sign that  said  "THELMA'S PLACE---POOL, BEER DOMINOS". A sign of equal size  immediately adjacent said "NO GUNS PERMITTED INSIDE".  It was  comforting to know that patrons of that establishment could drink  peacefully while game playing, knowing that customers are  required to  go out to the parking lot to resolve domino disagreements where guns are not  prohibited. I guess I have spent too  much time in the major metropolitan areas of Texas, and have forgotten about the  genuine Texas back country!! 
 
 
There was one other  noteworthy diversion.  Cycling through Bastrop State Park is known to be  one of the most strenous parts of the trip because of the extreme winding hills  in this beautiful, heavily-wooded area.  The Park is also confusing  because of its multiple intersecting roads through the park. I was  following another biker as we approached the park who was sporting a very fancy  biking shirt on which was written TAM Cycling Club.  I mentioned to him  that I was not looking forward to entering Bastrop State Park because of the  challenging steep hills.  He responded that he knew a route through  the park that was not only less hilly, but was also 3 miles shorter than  the route intended for the bikers.  I was all ears to the prospect of a  short cut, and agreed to follow him on this less strenuous and shorter  route.  We entered the park and,  for the next 10 miles according to  my odometer, it seemed like a roller coaster ride, with turning steep inclines,  and dangerously steep and turning declines.  Exactly one hour and ten  minutes after we entered the park, we finally exited the park--------------at  the exact same place where we entered.  I was exhausted and not  amused.  I should have known that an Aggie inherently is unable to find the  shortest route to Austin.
 
To fast forward the  story, since this has been far too long already, I made it to Austin on my own  power and did not ask for a lift at all the second day.  I was looking  forward to getting a much needed shower when I arrived at the finishing line  at the UT baseball stadium in Austin.  I had put in my most strenuous  effort during the last hour of the bike ride in the very hilly Austin area where  every hill looks like Mount Everest or its kissing cousin.  Unfortunately  for the person who sat next to me on the bus coming back to Houston, I was  told just after crossing the finish line that the last bus would leave  for Houston in only a few minutes and there was no time to  shower.  At that point in time, I looked like I just stepped out of a sweat  shower.  The stranger next to me on the bus did exactly what I dreaded--he  introduced himself, and waited for a reply.  I really didn't want this guy  to know my name--the name  of the guy who was giving the bus the aroma  of gymnasium locker room---- so after a moments thought, I held out my still  sweaty hand, and proudly said, "Howdy, my name's Harry  Reasoner."
 
Conclusion:
 
I participated in  this event because I wanted to help my colleagues and others who are victims of  MS.  If you previously made one of those weirdo pledges that are impossible  for anyone to calculate, please send my secretary a check made payable to  National Multiple Sclerosis Society in whatever amount makes you happy.  If  you have not made a donation, won't you do so today? You will benefit by giving  as much as the people with MS who need your help.  Thank  you.

  <content type="text" name="message">Following please find the Daily EnronOnline Executive Summary.

 

 

Due to size constraints on the Outlook System, the Public Report can no longer be included in the same email with the Weekly Management report. The Public Report is still accessible, however, at the intranet site address listed below. For this week, we will also be sending a supplemental email with the Public Report attached. 
The Weekly Management and Public reports can now be accessed directly through the EnronOnline Intranet Site at http://eolinfo.enron.com.

In order to access these report,  click on the link above. Once there, follow the link entitled "Reports" and then select the "Secured Reports" tab. A dropdown menu will appear with a list of the various secured reports available for viewing. After choosing the report you are interested in, a security window will appear requiring you to enter your Windows login ID and password. Simply enter your standard login and the report will load automatically.

We look forward to your feedback and comments. If you have any questions or experience any difficulties accessing your reports through the Intranet Site, please feel free to contact either Bryan Deluca at x36161 or Fraisy George at x35424.

I heard about your departure from Enron two weeks ago.  I was very
surprised. It must have been a very difficult decision for you as I know
how much of your heart and soul your poured into transforming Enron into
the preeminent company that it is now.  I hope that you are very proud of
what you accomplished over the past 12+ years.  I have never come across
a management team that even approaches the quality of you, John
Esslinger, Ken Lay and Rich Kinder.  I have also never come across a
business visionary anywhere near you and I expect that I, and everybody
else, will see you accomplish great things again.  But whatever you do, I
hope that this message finds you feeling well and happy.

  <content type="text" name="message">
Jeff,
 
Congratulations!--on  your amazing successes and your uncanny ability to make good  decisions.  I've always held you in the highest regard for being the  smartest person I ever worked with.  I'm certain it's been a tough few  weeks as you wrestled with your choice.  In a small way I can relate and if  others were willing to speak out you would find that you're far from  alone.
 
Nine years ago this  month you and I met in McKinsey's Dallas office to discuss my role with  Enron upon its acquisition of Access.  I maintained that my  employment agreement must have an escape clause to prevent me from being  transferred to Houston.  You were understandably surprised and  suggested that my career opportunities would be limited if I stayed in  Dublin.  Having recently been divorced I knew that if I left the city  where my then 14 and 15 year old sons lived with their mother I would  never be able to continue the father/sons relationship which was so  important to me.  When I met with Ken Lay a few weeks later, he too  seemed surprised that I wasn't going to join the management team in  Houston.
 
I don't know what  might have happened in my career had I not made that choice.  Perhaps  the politics in Houston would have done me in since I was truly a small  company entrepreneur.  But, when I compare myself to my then  peers, Lou, Mark, Ken and later Cliff, Andy and Kevin, I do  believe I was/am their intellectual equal.  Thus, I may have paid  an extremely high financial price for my personal choice.  Regrets?   On the contrary, my ex-wife moved away so I actually was able to raise my  sons, both of whom are doing great (One graduated from Washington University and  lives in San Francisco and the other graduates from Florida State this  December).  I also wouldn't have ended up with Sue and gained four more  kids.  I adopted the youngest--now nearly 11.  I also watched the  births of my two grandchildren and my step-son is trading emissions for  Enron.  
 
So, I react to  your decision with respect and admiration.  I really learned from Sue,  whose workaholic late husband died at 42, that life truly is too short.   We're enjoying ours and I hope you will too.  But, with only one child  left at home we're ready to move to warmer climes.  If you decide to change  the world again, even if on a smaller scale this time, and would like some help,  give me a call.  Best of luck.
 
Regards,

IV.  Finally, we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron.

1.	People (the high quality of people at Enron was the most widely-cited aspect):
---	talented
---	creative
---     learn from one another
2.	Culture and reputation:
---	innovative spirit
---   willingness to be aggressive and take risks
---   ability to embrace change
---   involvement in community
3.	Work environment:
---	pay and benefits
---   true meritocracy
---   unlimited opportunities

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A "meltdown" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact &amp; Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&amp;A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com &lt;http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY &amp; RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.</content>

  <content name="title" action="cluster">Update for Wednesday/Thursday?</content>
  <content type="text" name="message">Hello Ken

As we have not had a recent "daily update" from you - I write inquiring about the status of OUR company.

We heard about the acquisition discussions with Dynegy through the press (NOT from Enron's management!).  Clearly, this does not engender confidence in the management's communication philosophy.

We also heard that there is a meeting planned with Enron's banks on Friday - again through the press!  Communication failed again.

Further reductions in confidence came as Enron restated it's financial statements for the period 1997 through 2000.  Again this news was provided by the press!

Couple of questions for you - who were the commercial folks putting together the LJM, Chewco etc. deals?  Who were senior managers approving these deals?  Perhaps Enron should part company with some of those folks too.  

Where was the board and where were you when these deals were being done?  There appears to have been no corporate governance at the relevant periods!

On a personal level, I have invested many years in this company.  I currently have a holding of approx. 4,500 shares which I purchased because I believed in the company.  I also have numerous share options.  

Unfortunately, this episode has obliterated my confidence in management and in particular in you and Jeff Skilling.  I suspect you guys are ok - as you had the foresight (knowledge?) to cash out your holding during the latter part of last year and most of this year.

Please be aware that the fate of thousands of people rests in your hands.

I would be interested to hear your views.

  <content type="text" name="message">Hi Morgan,

Now that I do not work for Ken Lay and, as a stockholder, he actually
works for me, I can go directly too him and tell him what I really
think.  I can also tell all of the board members what I think as well,
without fear of getting fired by one of my former politically motivated
bosses.  Ken Lay earned a PHD as an economist.  He knows exactly what I
am talking about.  What he is doing is trying correct many bad Enron
decisions and to find "easy" income in a tough time.  He is very good at
"working the floor", as I call it, of the New York Stock Exchange.  He
has probably made deals with brokers and large mutual fund managers such
as Vanguard and Fidelity for them to repurchase large amounts of Enron
stock IF he can clean up Enron and bring in some revenue.  So far, so
good.  The problem arises when you look at the quality of the revenue
Ken is generating.  What I see is largely from "one time" sales of
existing assets and not from continuing operations.  In other words, the
effect is only temporary and it is much harder to re-create at a later
time because the "asset" is gone.

Personally, I am not buying into the "trust me" line from Enron.  It is
time for Enron's leadership to earn their millions in salary.

Love,
Dad

Importance: High


Ken,

Thank you for your response to my email.  Whether you actually took the
time to respond or left it to one of your assistants, I hope you read my
comments/suggestions and truly understood them.

I have a few more comments and suggestions!

You are correct, overall stock values have declined and Enron has some
additional, unique issues related to its broadband and tele-com
business, payments from California and large investments in foreign
power plants, particularly India.  However, I cannot agree with your
comments (or Jeff's) about short sellers.

Short sellers, like jackals and vultures, exist for a reason and are an
important part of the whole financial community in which we live.  Short
sellers (and Jackals) are always looking for a deal(meal).  When they
find an unhealthy company (animal), they investigate, which oftens leads
to greater opportunities.  Enron, under Jeff's leadership, was not
healthy and the short sellers (jackals) found a wonderful opportunity.

Your current job, as was Jeff Skilling's, is to not provide the short
sellers (jackals) a reason or opportunity to focus on Enron's stock
price.

I applaud your recent commitment to the financial community to provde
better definition regarding Enron's profits.  Developing the necessary
internal mechanism for a largely transparent financial reporting system
will police itself and will ultimately reinforce confidence in Enron's
true value.

As an economist, you need to remember that the market value of any
company, in today's economy, is largely based on the market's perception
of its value. As you and I have so recently seen, the market very often
reacts on preception and only looks at intrinsic value as an
afterthought.  The financial community believes that if it quacks like a
duck and walks like a duck, then....just maybe it is a duck and not
really a racehorse

Enron executives need to be more cognizant of the negative impact their
excessive insider selling of shares has on market preception.  Using
stock options in lieu of salary is a very powerful incentive but it can
also backfire, especially if the proper safe guards are not in place.
Excessive insider trades can and should be limited.

Doing good things for the right reasons works! For some years now,
Northern's leadership has not done many good things for the right
reasons.  They are highly political and have developed a nasty habit of
not telling their upper management (Stan Horton) the truth, but what
Stan wants to hear.  They are doing many things, not because they
should, but becaue they can get away with them.  This activity works
only as long as their customers do not have a choice!  You want
examples-look at the non-Enron pipeline activity in Florida and the
upper midwest.

A solid domestic asset with a reasonable return is much better than the
possibility of much higher returns on assets in unstable, foreign
markets.  Enron is not smarter than the world and the world has
certainly demonstrated that it will not allow Enron to possess very much
control over world affairs.  Let's learn from our mistakes!

Selling difficult assets, such as in India, is good.  Selling profitable
assets, such as Portland General is bad just to make the bollom line
revenue. Warren Buffet, an Omaha native, does not look like such an old
fuddy-duddy as he once did, as recently as last year.  Strong, solid
fandamentals do count and ......

Short sellers will always be around and DOING GOOD THINGS FOR THE RIGHT
REASONS truly works!!!

Sincerely,

Neal Shaw

I appreciate your recent e-mail concerning the decline in Enron's stock
price.  I share with you a very deep disappointment and frustration
about
this decline.

The decline has occurred for a number of reasons.  First, overall stock
values have declined significantly this year.  Enron's stock price has
declined more than averages primarily because of the total melt down in
the
broadband and tele-com business, difficulties with getting paid by the
California utilities and trouble with our large power plant and LNG
project
in India.  These problems have been further compounded by endless
misinformation and rumors, probably promulgated by short sellers.

In any event, I believe we our making progress in addressing these
various
problems.  I believe our stock price will increase over the short to
intermediate term.  With good success, we will be able to restore most
or
all of the value we lost this year over the not too distant future.

I appreciate your concerns and your suggestions and I will certainly do
everything I can to restore your confidence in Enron.

Sincerely,

Ken

   Ken,

   My name is Neal Shaw and I worked for Northern Natural Gas Company in
   Midland, Minneapolis and Omaha in the Marketing Department of Enron's
   Gas Pipeline Group for almost 19 years.  I left the company is
December
   2000. I have a major portion of my investment portfolio in Enron
shares.

   I just read an interesting article titled Sizing up CEO aplomb under
   duress a major concern. by Jamie Lareau.  This article focused on how
to
   recognize CEO's and CEO candidates who were not up to the
requirements
   of their job and used Jeff Skilling as an example.  I have agreed
with
   views of this journalist for some time, especially since Jeff called
a
   fund manager an "asshole".  Publically calling someone is simply Not
   something any CEO should do and you and Enron's board should have
done
   something about Jeff then.

   My point is as follows:  Where were you and the Enron Board during
all
   this?  Why have you let people like Jeff Skilling and Stan Horton
   virtually destroy all growth prospects for the pipelines and totally
   concentrate on trying to make money without an asset base?  A lot of
   people believed Jeff's hype and many people have suffered!  Has Jeff
   suffered?.  I think not especially since he has left Enron with
millions
   of our dollars in his pocket.  Hopefully he will be able to afford
the
   time off to "find himself".

   Did you see the movie "Top Gun"?  Toward the end of the movie, Tom
   Cruise, otherwise know as Maverick, blamed himself for the loss of
his
   friend and simply disengaged from combat flying.  However, when
things
   got really rough, Maverick re-engaged the enemy and did what he was
   hired to do.

   Do you know where this is going?

   You are once again Enron's "Top Gun"!  The enemy is Enron's depressed
   stock price.  It is time for you to re-engage and live up to your
title
   of "Top Gun" and CEO!  I and the rest of Enron's stock holders need
you
   to repair the damage Jeff did and STOP the damage people like Stan
   Horton are currently doing and get Enron back in the mix.

   I sincerely hope you are still capable of doing a good job.  If you
are
   not, refund your salary since Jeff took over and step down.

  <content type="text" name="message">Ken,

Thank you for your response to my email.  Whether you actually took the
time to respond or left it to one of your assistants, I hope you read my
comments/suggestions and truly understood them.

I have a few more comments and suggestions!

You are correct, overall stock values have declined and Enron has some
additional, unique issues related to its broadband and tele-com
business, payments from California and large investments in foreign
power plants, particularly India.  However, I cannot agree with your
comments (or Jeff's) about short sellers.

Short sellers, like jackals and vultures, exist for a reason and are an
important part of the whole financial community in which we live.  Short
sellers (and Jackals) are always looking for a deal(meal).  When they
find an unhealthy company (animal), they investigate, which oftens leads
to greater opportunities.  Enron, under Jeff's leadership, was not
healthy and the short sellers (jackals) found a wonderful opportunity.

Your current job, as was Jeff Skilling's, is to not provide the short
sellers (jackals) a reason or opportunity to focus on Enron's stock
price.

I applaud your recent commitment to the financial community to provde
better definition regarding Enron's profits.  Developing the necessary
internal mechanism for a largely transparent financial reporting system
will police itself and will ultimately reinforce confidence in Enron's
true value.

As an economist, you need to remember that the market value of any
company, in today's economy, is largely based on the market's perception
of its value. As you and I have so recently seen, the market very often
reacts on preception and only looks at intrinsic value as an
afterthought.  The financial community believes that if it quacks like a
duck and walks like a duck, then....just maybe it is a duck and not

I want to take a moment to thank each of you for having a summer Analyst or Associate work on your team. I also want to remind everyone what a high stakes activity this is for Enron.
Based on your recommendation, we will make offers at the end of the summer to those interns who perform, and who you endorse as a potential future member of your team. Those interns who have had a good experience and accept our offer will be the lowest risk hires we make - from any source. We will have effectively interviewed and watched them work for 2-3 months. They also have the potential to be the most effective advocates and talent scouts we have, when they return to campus. On the flip side, those who don't have meaningful assignments, or have bad experiences during the summer can severely hurt our efforts.
Thank you again for being part of this very important activity. If you have any questions, or if areas of concern arise during the summer, please contact Ted Bland (x35275), Traci Warner (x33242) or me (x36671).
We appreciate your contributions to this important effort for Enron. 
Billy

  <content type="text" name="message">Ken,

Thanks for having the call yesterday.  I am a believer in Enron and we are
buying your debt.

Here's short feedback on the call.  I give the call a B-/C+ grade.  If you
want a good example of a company call listen to the tougher calls So Cal Ed
had for investors.  They talked with investors twice weekly for months.
There is an honestness and openness about the calls that worked to keep
investors informed.

The angry exchange with the short seller was a blunder.  No matter what the
question, no matter how stupid or obnoxious, the Enron answer should always
be empathetic and pointedly factual.  Yes, you will have to open the kimono
more than Enron ever has to restore confidence.

ENE has become more a financial institution, and less an energy company
with hard assets.  You are in a confidence game pure and simple.  Any
attempt at keeping things close to the vest will backfire and exacerbate
the current crisis.  If you want to see disclosure in financials, look at
Citi's...

ENE is having an encounter session with the entire investment community.
This is not a time to be aggressive and smart.  It is a time to be open,
honest and self-effacing.

Third party confirmation will go a long way in restoring confidence which
means 1) Moody's maintains their rating or limits the change to a one-notch
downgrade (bond rating) with stable outlook restored (the Moody's analyst
is pissed you surprised with the write-off), 2) the SEC gives ENE a fairly
clean report (no self-dealing found) on their transactions with private
equity partnerships, 3) no more large surprise write-offs, 4) outside
auditors continue with unqualified audit reports, 5) operating earnings
targets are met for this year and next, and 6)fuller disclosure is made in
quarterly releases.

Of course, if any fraud or malfeasance is found, you guys and ENE are
history.

I have my ass on the line because I believe in ENE.  We have made
investments.  ENE is in the shitter because of ENE's past communication and
behavior mistakes.  Be humble, be smart, and change.

Good Luck!

Jeff

P.S.  You state there is a Chinese wall between LJM and ENE.  Why in the
world then would you have the same guy, Fastow, play key controlling roles
in both organizations?  If you want to pay him, pay him.  Keep it simple.

I am glad Skilling is gone.  I wouldn't touch your company's debt while he
was there.  I hated him and his attitude?.and my past exposure to him was
extremely limited.

  <content type="text" name="message">Ken,

My name is Neal Shaw and I worked for Northern Natural Gas Company in
Midland, Minneapolis and Omaha in the Marketing Department of Enron's
Gas Pipeline Group for almost 19 years.  I left the company is December
2000. I have a major portion of my investment portfolio in Enron shares.

I just read an interesting article titled Sizing up CEO aplomb under
duress a major concern. by Jamie Lareau.  This article focused on how to
recognize CEO's and CEO candidates who were not up to the requirements
of their job and used Jeff Skilling as an example.  I have agreed with
views of this journalist for some time, especially since Jeff called a
fund manager an "asshole".  Publically calling someone is simply Not
something any CEO should do and you and Enron's board should have done
something about Jeff then.

My point is as follows:  Where were you and the Enron Board during all
this?  Why have you let people like Jeff Skilling and Stan Horton
virtually destroy all growth prospects for the pipelines and totally
concentrate on trying to make money without an asset base?  A lot of
people believed Jeff's hype and many people have suffered!  Has Jeff
suffered?.  I think not especially since he has left Enron with millions
of our dollars in his pocket.  Hopefully he will be able to afford the
time off to "find himself".

Did you see the movie "Top Gun"?  Toward the end of the movie, Tom
Cruise, otherwise know as Maverick, blamed himself for the loss of his
friend and simply disengaged from combat flying.  However, when things
got really rough, Maverick re-engaged the enemy and did what he was
hired to do.

Do you know where this is going?

You are once again Enron's "Top Gun"!  The enemy is Enron's depressed
stock price.  It is time for you to re-engage and live up to your title
of "Top Gun" and CEO!  I and the rest of Enron's stock holders need you
to repair the damage Jeff did and STOP the damage people like Stan
Horton are currently doing and get Enron back in the mix.

I sincerely hope you are still capable of doing a good job.  If you are
not, refund your salary since Jeff took over and step down.

Sincerely,

Neal Shaw

                cc: Mr. Norm Blake 
From:   Ronnie Chan                 (fax: 719-632-4180) 
Dear Ken, 
My flight this morning from Singapore arrived Hong Kong at 1:40am local time.  Upon deplaning, I called Kelly Johnson but could not join the board meeting because I was unable to find a fixed line.  I phoned Paula Rieker after getting home to receive an update of the meeting.  Apparently the session ended right at the time I rang Kelly.  
Two thoughts: to bring in either as a director or as an advisor a highly reputable financial person such as Bob Rubin is a good idea.  If Bob (whom I saw last Friday in Shanghai) cannot do it, you may consider Felix Rohatyn.  He was of course the person in 1975 who bailed out the financial crisis of New York City.  Until recently, he was U.S. Ambassador to France.  I know him personally but not well.  However, another friend Peter Goldmark who is chairman, CEO and publisher of the International Herald Tribune knows Felix very well.  Peter told me that he was excellent in crisis situations.  Together with his financial savvy and reputation, maybe he can be considered by Enron at this time.  Coincidentally, Peter was head of the New York Port Authority in the late 70's and early 80's.
At the October 24 board meeting, you told us about Jeff Skilling's phone call right beforehand.  Could it be that knowing that the board would not invite him back, he was offering himself just to give the impression of not having left us in anticipation of the present problems?  If so, then we should not turn him down right away.  Perhaps we should somehow make him not want to come back.  Maybe this is too convoluted.  
Ken, these are difficult times but I am pleased that the board is acting in unison.  After the problems are over, I still think that my suggestion to you during the last board dinner in Houston should be looked into, i.e. have a strategy retreat where the board can have thorough discussions on the many fundamental aspects of our business.  Present difficulties only point to that need.  But for now, let us get over the immediate hurdle first.  
Sincerely, 
Ronnie Chan 
P.S.    Since I have spoken to Norm about the strategy retreat, I am copying this letter to him. </content>

  <content type="text" name="message">Mr. Lay-

With all that is going on, a quick note to let you know that you still have an employee who is confident something good will prevail and not all may be lost.  Though I have only been with the company for almost 2 years, I personally feel you are doing all you can to salvage what is possible.  Your reputation precedes you and the many years you spent building this company up. I feel deep down that you wouldn't have done anything to jeapordize your name despite what the media and finance markets read.  Responsibility is to be shared.  Unfortunately, you have been left to do the clean up.  I do believe in my heart of hearts that once Jeff Skilling and Andy Fastow were in the positions they were, greed took over.  Unfortunately, they took advantage of your position and possibly lost sight of dealings going on with the presumption that these men were of the utmost, outstanding character.

Please view this email as simply a boost to your morale and not anything more than to simply advise you of what possibly many employees feel but have yet to convey.  

Thanks -

  <content name="title" action="cluster">ENRON - A Study in How So Few Could Screw So Many</content>
  <content type="text" name="message">Mr. Lay-

After reading the news of your $60,000,000 to $80,000,000 payout, I am disgusted and appalled all over again.  Unfortunately, that's a daily occurrence. 

I have been employed with Enron since May of 1993, when Enron purchased LRC.  I was very skeptical of Enron back then and was unsure of my future with the company.  As time went on, I got more comfortable with the Enron way and learned how to survive and even be a little successful here.  I became a believer in the things Enron could accomplish, a champion of our hard-nosed, driven executives (at least some of them).  I bought Enron stock and held on to those valuable options.

Over the last 18 months, my coworkers and I have viewed the weekly, sometimes daily, selling of Enron stock and exercising of options by our top executives (past and present and including you).  We came up with all kinds of reasons that the executives would be doing this -- they're so overly compensated that they have to cash out some every now and then, divorce settlements, mistress settlements, buying a new home in Aspen, buying an island in the Caribbean, etc., etc. etc....  We never wanted to admit that they knew something we didn't.  Things were great, weren't they?  Jeff Skilling told us that Enron was going to be the "World's Leading Company."  He even put the goofy acronyms on his car license plate.  He told us gas traders in February how the stock was going to $126 by the end of the year. Now, being the cynic that I am, I didn't believe the $126, although I have to admit I was hopeful; I figured that if Jeff had the audacity to throw out a number that high, then it was reasonable to expect the stock to be fairly stable, i.e., +/- 20%.  

Needless to say, I didn't sell my stock and didn't exercise any more options.  In fact, I bought more stock when it first started going down.  I'm afraid that there are many more just like me.  I'm fortunate in that I have many working years ahead of me (where, I don't know) to try to build up my savings again.  Many others are not that fortunate.  So many have spent their entire careers here, helping to build this company up.  They were looking forward to retiring soon and enjoying the fruits of their labor.  And let me remind you that their retirement accounts were in many cases a lot less than a month's compensation for you.  Now even that is essentially gone.  Other employees were just ready to cash in some of their options to pay for their children's college tuition.  The stories are too numerous to list, and the more I think about it, the more sickened I become.

It is painfully obvious to me and my coworkers, as well as the rest of the industry and Houston, that Enron's executives knew that there were skeletons in the closet and began cashing in ahead of this freefall.  The employees and the rest of the world were fed a bunch of half-truths and mystery mumbo-jumbo.  There should be an accounting for this behavior.  You and your cohorts have ruined so many lives.  Think about that while you're spending your millions.....

  <content type="text" name="message">Dear Mr. Lay:

In this trying time of second-guesses and angry shareholders, I wanted to let you know that I have appreciated working for you and share a quick story of how you shaped my view of Enron and the corporate world in general.

My second rotation as an associate was to write speeches for the Office of the Chairman.  Generally, I was creating presentations for Jeff Skilling, but I did create a couple for you as well.  The one I remember best was for the speech at Astro Hall for the Houston Energy Conference where we announced Enron Online.  Not only did you let me lead the internal roundtable (I remember sitting at the table, trying to keep my composure as Greg Whalley, Dan Leff, Louise Kitchen and others asked specifics about the slides I created), but you also (generally) agreed with my answers and thanked me for a job well done.  That night, I shared a bottle of champagne with my wife and truly believed I could do anything!!

So, as far as I am concerned, you have done a tremendous job.  Everything happening now is unfortunate.  It happened on your watch and thus is partly your responsibility.  But you have stepped up to the plate, most likely saved more jobs than lost, and been accountable in more ways than one.  Being a leader in good times and in bad, and more importantly affecting the lives of your employees on a personal basis, are truly attributes that I hope to continue in my lifetime.

I just wanted you to know that you have truly made a difference in one man's career.  And I feel all the better for it.

My prayers go to you and your family.

Best regards,

Michael Harris

  <content name="title" action="cluster">Anniversary Luncheon</content>
  <content type="text" name="message">Dear Mr. Lay,

I am one of many long time employees who has lost my life's savings and my kid's college fund.

Today I am receiving my 15 Years of Service Award and having my Anniversary luncheon.  Would you like to attend?  My Department would appreciate a candid picture of how this could have happened to such a great company.  I have gone through tough times and many good times with Northern Natural Gas, InterNorth and Enron.  I was always so proud to be a part of this company. 

Should I have seen this coming?  I was just another sheep following and believing everything our leaders, Skilling, said regarding the probability of Enron's stock splitting.  I didn't play the market but looked at my 401K stock purchases as long term retirement and continued to put money into the 401K even when we (my family) were struggling to do so.

I too grew up on a farm in Missouri.  I was raised under the same Midwest rooted values and the strict convictions of my father that you did not take charity or borrow money.  He also preached that to sue was not the way to correct a wrong.  I was always a little prideful that you too were a Midwesterner, with those rooted values of high integrity, compassion, and honesty.

Life goes on.  I hope to continue my employment though all of this and will continue to be a great employee, only now for Dynegy.  This  is also a concern since I am in my late 40's.  My job, my kid's education, and my retirement weigh heavily along with the atmosphere we are all currently living in.  

This reality is a struggle with many unanswered questions and devastating concerns for the future.  

I would appreciate your thoughts.  

Respectfully yours,

  <content type="text" name="message">
  
Dear Ken,
            I would like to apologize for not responding to the survey at the beginning of September. It wasn't a statement or anything. We were just up to our ears in a project that had to go out on the Wednesday following Labor Day. And the "well, I'll fill it out during lunch" is never a really good idea. Lunchtime disappears so quickly.
            So by way of apology I am sending you this letter with some thoughts and observations about life at Enron. I hope you don't think I'm "line jumping" by doing this. But I've observed that surveys often get you information you want, not information you need. The numbers on the survey look good. But there's always room for improvement.
            I'm very pleased that you're once again involved in the day-to-day operations. I'm also very glad that you're emphasizing our values. I have to admit that they weren't the reason I came to Enron-I needed a job-but as soon as I was here, they became a major reason for staying. It's not just another job, if the values are believed and followed. The perks are nice, but I bet that the values have as much to do with our being named a great place to work as anything else.
            I wonder, though, if everyone shares my-our-view. There was a rumor going around the day after the all-employee meeting that senior management was not happy when you announced we were going to reaffirm our values. That strikes me as a little too soon after the meeting to be totally credible, and I really can't picture senior management telling people what they really think about our values or anything, if they really think that way.
            I also don't doubt that it's true. We seem to have gone from a company that treasures its intellectual capital and people to one where reorganizations and "disappearances" are more the order of the day. Although it's gotten a little better, our values right now seem to be FUD-a computer industry term for fear, uncertainty, and doubt. Many people-myself included-spend a lot of time looking over our shoulders as we go through seemingly constant reorganization and reevaluation, waiting for the other shoe to drop-on us. Rumors (the whole unit is being phased out) were rampant, and it didn't help when the PEP scores came out with no indication why (really low) scores were given, or, more importantly, how we could go about improving our performance.
            This doesn't strike me as the best way to increase productivity or esprit d' corps.
            We need to add value to the values. As part of my initial orientation, Joe Sutton asked us to define and give examples of our values. A couple of months later, Jeff Skilling addressed "Enron at a Glance." He spent serious time explaining the importance of the values, too. Hey, I thought, these guys are serious about this stuff. 
            Since then, though, all my reinforcement about our values comes from the elevator, right after The Building Guy.
            Last spring, we were all trooped over to the Doubletree to see the harassment players, costing a fair chunk of time and money, I'm guessing. So which, in my puny little brain, is more important? Where the dollars go, or the occasional reference in what somebody considers otherwise dead time?
            There are ways we can adjust. I would like to suggest two possibilities. First, I would like to propose a refresher course in our values. Take time out of our days. Get in experts. Hire a hall. Give us cookies. Heck, maybe even lunch. Make the bigwigs in each unit do off-sites. They like off-sites. 
            We'll get the idea. This is important.
            One other notion. You may recall bumper stickers that read, "Commit Random Acts of Kindness." I would like to suggest a "Random Acts of Values" award. Actually, I wouldn't want to make it an award. "Random Acts of Values" recognition? captured? Maybe. 
            I'll keep doing the day in and the day out, because it's the right thing to do, not because of an award. But recognizing what we think is important might give a boost to some other people. It will at least raise the profile. And it would also tell us something if the recognition was going to everyone except senior management. I'd really hate to see my rumormonger proven true.
            I know we have the Chairman's Award. But I'm no Mark Herada. I would need two lifetimes to do half of what he's done. The Chairman's Award is really important, and I will nominate someone. People like Mark truly deserve it, and I know a couple. But it's one award, once a year. 
            We should recognize little moments. I have no idea how we would capture them, and I don't know what to do with a guy who is really respectful today and tomorrow resumes being a jerk. But we can figure out something. 
            And I'm suspecting that you really wouldn't be terribly bent out of shape if you had to recognize 20,000 values moments, especially if they were one per person.
 
Sincerely,
John</content>

Dear Ken, 
The purpose of this message is to request a meeting with you at your convenience.  In light of my work in the past with Enron, I hope this request is not presumptuous on my part; certainly, my intent is to be helpful.  We met briefly five years ago when I was a director at McKinsey working with David Noble at Enron on leadership team and organization issues.  Dave introduced me to you because he felt that my experience was particularly relevant to several of the challenges you were facing.  However, we all concluded that it would be difficult for me to work with Jeff Skilling at that time because of his earlier junior/senior relationship with me at McKinsey.
Shortly after that discussion, I retired from McKinsey on very friendly terms to form my own firm.  Katzenbach Partners LLC specializes in organizational performance, leadership capability, and employee commitment issues.  We have a particularly distinctive competence in helping organizations use cultural and value-based elements to build "peak performance" across important segments or all of the employee base.  We believe we are unique in applying the intellectual creativity and analytical rigor of top strategy firms to these kinds of organizational and cultural challenges.  Our firm now has over fifty highly qualified professionals, and we serve a range of leading and successful companies on these issues.
Based on my previous recollections of some of the people challenges facing Enron and the leadership transition you are likely undergoing, I feel that Katzenbach Partners could be particularly useful to you and your organization right now.  Since leaving McKinsey, I have continued to conduct extensive research in the areas of leadership, cultural change, and employee motivation.  In addition, my firm has significant experience with leading companies helping them organize to establish new values and change cultural behavior to improve enterprise performance.
Based upon our limited current exposure to Enron, the recent number of leadership changes appear very likely to create cultural issues and gaps that may warrant new, creative approaches to realign behaviors and commitment within the company.  If you find these kinds of issues relevant and timely, I would be very interested in meeting to discuss and trade current perspectives.  I will ask my colleague in Houston, Kenny Kurtzman, to call to see if it would be appropriate for us to get together.
Sincerely, 
Jon R. Katzenbach

  <content type="text" name="message">
Sir,
 
Before I start, let me introduce myself.  My name is Thirumalesh Aedunuthula.  I had the pleasure of interning with Enron, this summer.  I am a MBA student at Louisiana State University and worked with Enron Tax department.
 
Over the past few weeks, things have changed for Enron at a faster pace than expected/imagined.  To some, it is amazing how stock fell from $90 to 26 cents just in a year.  People have been attributing lot of things for the fall, from California crises to international deals, without actually taking time to find out what went wrong with Enron .
 
As an intern, I had the opportunity to feel the work culture of Enron.  I felt that Enron is making profits not because it is in Energy Industry but because of energetic people like you and Mr.. Jeff Skilling and many others. I strongly believe that greatest asset with Enron is its talent pool, which made the company what it is today.
Today, we have a discussion on Enron's Crisis in class.  I know, for sure, that many would be interested in voicing their opinion against Enron.  I would go to class and take the side of Enron.  I might be in minority.  But that doesn't matter, as to understand what Enron is, one has to really experience it.
 
Hoping that Enron will really climb back, much faster than its fall....
 
Yours Truly,

Dear Ken,
 A lot has happened since our conversation in snowy  Washington at Joe Hilling's retirement reception.  Unable to identify a mutually agreed  upon challenge for me, I retired from Enron with the objective of providing  business leadership elsewhere.  Many  others, including Jeff Skillings, have since departed as well.  Reflecting on the events of the past  several months, I would like to talk with you regarding how my extensive  experience in managing and divesting Enron's foreign and domestic businesses and  assets could be utilized by the company on an interim basis.  My goal is to assist your efforts in  restoring investor confidence in and shareholder value of Enron, which has been  an integral part of my life for 30 years.
 I will contact your office next week to find a  convenient time for us to visit on this matter.
 Best regards,
 Mike Dahlke

Good to hear your voice this morn.  As I said, I have intentionally avoiding bothering you guys until I had something to contribute. 
The info that follows is probably more than you want.  But I gave Paul your (almost) complete history and I think you should know his. 
First met in mid-fifties when I was at Dallas Fed and assigned for two weeks to NYFed to learn firsthand about open market operations on the trading desk, where Paul worked.  (I was an "Associate Economist" with FOMC and advised Dallas Fed President on policy and I accompanied him to those super-secret meetings.) 
Paul and I hit it off and when I left Treasury in 1961 Dillon let Bob Roosa bring Paul in to take over my duties.  By then I was with ABA in New York and Paul and I became friends during my frequent work with the Dillon Treasury and with Roosa. 
Paul left Treasury in about the mid-sixties to become VP of planning at Chase.  In late 1968, when David Kennedy asked me to be his number two, I said yes on two conditions: That I get a car for both business and personal use (okay) and that he bring in Volcker as under secretary for monetary affairs and that latter report directly to him, not through me (as had been Dillon's system).  He said okay if we could get Paul.  Upon which I went to Chase and, given the stipulations about reporting, he agreed to come. 
He hit it off great with DK's successors, Connally and then Shultz, and left in '74 (I think) to be pres of NYFed.  Markets in effect forced Carter to appoint Paul to head Fed in 1979, where he led the System into breaking the back of double-digit inflation (plus sharp but relatively short recessioin). 
I think he went with Wolfensohn from there and made a ton of money. After W left Paul took over and later sold out to Bankers Trust. 
Although Paul is an independent (traditonal at NYFed), he is very public-minded and also somewht left-of-center on public policy.  One of my many sins in eyes of Nixon's White House gang is the true belief that I put something over on them in getting Paul to join us.  Paul was for many years a member of ACCF board as favor to me but finally resigned over our estate-tax position last year (and never did like our capital gains positions).  He and Pug may be considered soulmates on some of these issues, especially estate tax. 
In our initial conversation this morning, Paul asked me if Skilling's resignation related to recent problems.  I said I did not know but did not think so. 
Paul is teaching at Princeton and looking for ways to give away his money, which he seems embarrassed to have.  His wife, who had chronic health problems, died a couple of years ago.  I think one of the children had health problems too. 
In our second conversation today I told Paul that I was convinced that Enron was (mentioned innovation awards) and still is a great company.  I strongly urged him to accept a relationship that would show his confidence and also advance your efforts. 
Good luck. Call or e-mail me if you have any questions or if there is anything else you want me to do.
