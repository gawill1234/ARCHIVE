<section  id="Overview">
<section type="faq"  id="Why the name Viv&iacute;simo?">
In several Romance languages, Viv&iacute;simo suggests lively, bright, and clever, in the superlative. Our products enliven the deadening process of making sense out of masses of textual information, hence the aptness of the name.
</section>



<section type="faq" id="Is Viv&iacute;simo.com a search engine?">
The search services at our Viv&iacute;simo.com home page are a showcase demonstration of our document clustering technology,
as applied to web search.  No database of web pages are stored there, since we do not crawl or index the web ourselves. 
The meta-search service at our home page organizes the outputs of other search engines: URLs, titles, and short descriptions. 
It is more properly seen as a clustering engine.
</section>

<section type="faq" id="Is Viv&iacute;simo.com a meta search engine?">
Viv&iacute;simo.com organizes the combined outputs of multiple search engines, so in this sense it is a
meta-search engine which clusters the search results, as a technology demonstration.
</section>

<section type="faq" id="How does the search at Viv&iacute;simo.com work?">
The core Viv&iacute;simo technology is called <a ref='What is "document clustering"?'><i>Document clustering</i></a>: the automatic
organization of documents into meaningful groups.
The Viv&iacute;simo.com web search hooks up our Content Integrator (meta-search) and Clustering Engine products to the
results of different search engines.  That is, it:
<ol>
<LI>Queries one or more web search engines.</LI>
<LI>Parses their result pages to extract the documents (titles, URLs, and short descriptions).</LI>
<LI>Groups the documents based on this information, <a ref="Is &V; processing the full content of the web pages it shows?">not the full web pages</a>.</LI>
<LI><a ref="How do you rank the items on the right?">Orders</a> the groups and the documents within each group. </LI>
<LI>Displays the hierarchical categories.</LI>
</ol>
All this is done <a ref="How fast is your software?">fast</a>.
</section>


<section type="faq" id="Who can benefit from Viv&iacute;simo's technology?">
  
Enterprises or OEMs that need to make sense of large amounts
of textual information can benefit from Viv&iacute;simo's document clustering products, which can be
applied to <a ref="What other text sources can you deal with?">any type of textual
content</a>.  The Viv&iacute;simo Clustering Engine can be easily <a ref="Is Viv&iacute;simo easy to integrate?">integrated</a> with any internet, intranet, or extranet
search engine or other database.

See <a ref="Can I use &V; with my own search engine? On my own content?"/> and <a ref="Can I integrate the Viv&iacute;simo Clustering Engine in my own product?"/> for more details.
Of course, individuals can freely search the web at Viv&iacute;simo.com and see organized results.
</section>


<section type="faq" id="When should I use your search service?">

If you're looking for a specific web page and can formulate an accurate
query, then use a regular search engine.  If you can't, or if you're
looking for an overview or just browsing, use Viv&iacute;simo.

<section  id="Technology">
<section type="faq" id="How does the Clustering Engine work?  ">
 

We use a specially-developed heuristic algorithm to group - or
<i>cluster</i> - textual documents.  This algorithm is based on an old
artificial intelligence idea: a good cluster - or document grouping -
is one which possesses a good, readable description.  So, rather than
form clusters and then figure out how to describe them, we only form
well-described clusters in the first place.
<P/>
The Clustering Engine gets inserted in the pipeline of search results
that are retrieved by a search engine or other source of textual
information.
<P/>
Technically speaking, Viv&iacute;simo is doing <a ref='What does "on-the-fly clustering" 
mean?'>on-the-fly</a>, <a ref='What does "conceptual clustering" mean?'>conceptual</a>,
<a ref='What is "hierarchical clustering"?'>hierarchical</a>,
<a ref='What is "document clustering"?'>document clustering</a>.  
</section>

<section type="faq" id='What is "document clustering"?'>


Document clustering is the automatic organization of documents into
groups or <i>clusters</i>. "Document clustering" differs from other
techniques (classification, taxonomy building, tagging, etc.)
in that it is fully automated: further human intervention is not needed, 
although in many applications the Clustering Engine installation can benefit from
specific domain expertise, when it is available.
<p/>
The biggest challenge for document clustering has been to quickly find
meaningful groups that are concisely described. Our innovation relies
on a newly discovered heuristic algorithm that does this well.
<p/>
Our Clustering Engine has achieved good results on web pages, patent
abstracts, scholarly publications, newswires, meeting transcripts, and 
television transcripts with little or no customization in every case.
</section>


<section type="faq" id='What is "hierarchical clustering"?'>


Instead of producing a flat list of groups, Viv&iacute;simo's Clustering Engine
organizes groups into a hierarchy or tree, using a well-known "Windows
Explorer"-style interface. This interface can be used with no training
since it is quite intuitive. Users can zoom in on items of interest
while keeping visible an overview of all the topics.
</section>


<section type="faq" id='What does "conceptual clustering" mean?'>


Conceptual clustering methods interleave the process of forming groups
with the step of describing them, much like people might do by hand.
So, if Viv&iacute;simo's document clustering tries to form a group but judges that the 
group cannot be described concisely, accurately, and distinctively, the group is rejected.
In contrast, many other approaches rely mainly on mathematical optimization, in which
description of the groups is relegated to the end <i> after </i> the
groups are formed, which has never worked well.
</section>


<section type="faq" id='What does "on-the-fly clustering" mean?'>


Clustering is done just before the user sees the search results,
<i>on the fly</i>.  There is no need to prepare anything beforehand,
much less pre-process the entire document collection from where the
results came. For the IT integrator, this means that there is no complicated
interdependence between
Viv&iacute;simo's products and, say, a search engine.  The interface consists of the plain text
(titles and abstracts) of the search results as listed in XML or an html page.
</section>


<section type="faq" id="What is the difference between clustering and classification?">


Clustering is a fully automatic process that requires no preparation
steps no maintenance.  Classification generally requires
pre-specifying categories (typically broad and hence rather bland) and
updating these categories as new documents are added to the
collection.
</section>

<section type="faq" id="If I can pre-classify all my documents, why do I need your clustering?">


Three problems with pre-assigned categories are that the categories
necessarily will be too broad, the categories may not match the
content of the documents, and constant maintenance is required to keep
up as new documents are added to the collection.  On-the-fly
clustering leads to crisp, generally accurate clusters and requires no
maintenance.  One customer (the Institute of Physics Publishing) has 
<A href="http://www.infotoday.com/newsbreaks/nb020325-2.htm"> reported </A> 
reported the Clustering Engine's accuracy at 90%.
</section>


<section type="faq" id="How does your technology differ from Northern Light's?">


Northern Light classifies each document within an entire source
collection into pre-defined subjects and then, at query time, selects
those subjects that best match the search results.  Viv&iacute;simo's Clustering Engine
does not use pre-defined subjects; its folder descriptions are created
spontaneously.  Type a few queries and compare.
</section>


<section type="faq" id="What is the difference between document clustering and phrase extraction?">


Phrase extraction systems identify phrases (adjacent words) that
appear often in the search results and then group documents that
contain these phrases. Such approaches need to overcome the challenge
of avoiding redundancy, since distinct phrases may overlap, for
example "Carnegie Mellon" and "Carnegie Mellon University".  Also, as
individual documents become larger (i.e., more than the one or
two-line summaries returned by general web search engines), there is
the separate challenge of dealing with the <i> much </i> larger number
of phrases that result.
<P/>
In contrast, a major challenge for clustering approaches such as
Viv&iacute;simo's is performing well <i> even as the document summaries
become very small </i>, as seen in general web searching.  Users of
Viv&iacute;simo.com may judge the results themselves.
</section>


<section type="faq" id="Are the folder descriptions generated by humans?">


We are gratified that users and customers sometimes ask this.  The descriptions are
created spontaneously by the software.  When they are good, it seems
that a human being must have created the categories and the machine
merely recognizes the documents that belong there, which is not the case.  
However, our technology is not perfect: the diligent user will surely
spot an occasional description that only a machine would make up, but these incidents are
becoming fewer as more knowledge of English (and other languages') syntax is added to
our Clustering Engine.
</section>


<section type="faq" id="Can I use your clustering software to allow top-down browsing of my company's content, in addition to improving the presentation of search results?">


Yes.  One approach is to create a shallow taxonomy into which
documents are placed.  Then when a user reaches an end-point by
following one or several links top-down, our Enterprise Publisher product can cluster the
hundreds or thousands of documents at that end-point.  This allows using the very
same interface for top-down browsing as for searching.
</section>

<section type="faq" id="Why isn't clustering used everywhere?">


Document clustering is a decades-old research challenge, but the
quality hasn't been good enough.  Our clusters (or folders) have good
concise descriptions, our user interaction is simple and intuitive, and
the software is fast.  The combination means that document clustering
can now reach a mass audience.
</section>


<section type="faq" id="Why not just improve the ranking of search results?">


Much engineering talent has focused on improving the ranking of
search results, with sometimes impressive progress.  But this is the
wrong problem, since one-dimensional ranked lists are inherently
limited.  One can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.
<P/>
All the Clustering Engine asks of a search engine is that it deliver
a good set of several hundred hits.  This is much easier than requiring it to rank really
well within those hundreds.
<p/>
This means that our Clustering Engine works well even with those (unnamed) enterprise search engines
that have inferior relevancy ranking, since the importance of accurate ranking is much lessened by clustering the
results into folders.

</section>


<section type="faq" id="Do you just add prefixes and suffixes to the search query?">


No.  Simple one-word queries often lead to clusters that modify the
query.  For example, "soap" can lead to "soap opera", "handmade soap",
and "soap bubbles", but also to "simple object access protocol", known
also by its SOAP acronym.
</section>


<section type="faq" id="Is every document assigned to a single place in the hierarchy?">


No.  Sometimes a document fits well in more than one place in the
hierarchy, so we place it everywhere it fits.  For users, this is
better than forcing documents to fit in a single location.  Of course, a silly method would
put every document just about everywhere, but ours is not a silly method.
</section>


<section type="faq" id="Do your clustering products work in other languages besides English?">


Yes. Alphabetic languages can be handled by including a
language-specific stoplist (list of non-informative words, like
English "the", German "nach", Spanish "para", French "toujours") and a
stemmer, which recognizes similar meanings among syntactic variants
like English "helps", "helpful", and "helping".  We have versions for the major European
languages: Danish, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish.
Our products also embed other semantic and syntactic knowledge that tends to vary across languages.
A Chinese version is available, Japanese is planned, and Korean is available from 
<A href="http://vivisimo.co.kr"> our Korean sister company </A>.  
Note that the search service at Viv&iacute;simo.comn is not optimized for all the languages
that our products support. 
</section>


<section type="faq" id="How fast is your software?">


Indexing and clustering of 200 document summaries (about two-three lines
per summary) takes about 170ms on a 1.7GHz Pentium IV running Linux.
</section>

<section type="faq" id="Does Viv&iacute;simo's document clustering return a fixed number of groups?">


No.  The number of groups emerges from the relationships that our
algorithms find within the documents.  We have seen cases where a
large collection gives rise to only two groups.
<P/>
On the web, the number of groups is generally high, reflecting the
diversity of the web.  On more focused content, sometimes fewer groups
are found.
</section>

<section type="faq" id="What other text sources can you deal with?">


In principle, our Clustering Engine can cluster any textual content from any enterprise or web search engine. Likewise, the technology demonstration
at our home page can - in principle - cluster any search engine results  We plan to add a variety of search sources to
our site. 
<P/>
If you are interested in licensing our Clustering Engine and wish to see how it performs
on your own search engine, email us at <A href="mailto:demos@vivisimo.com" class="doc">demos@vivisimo.com</A>.
We may be able to set up a demo that clusters the search results from your own
engine and displays them on our web site, for your evaluation.
<P/>
The Viv&iacute;simo Enterprise Publisher clusters larger numbers of text documents besides search results.

may be able to cluster and display, for your evaluation.
</section>

<section type="faq" id="On your search service, why do you get better results with some search engines than with others?">


Some search engines deliver better document summaries, which lead to
better raw material for Viv&iacute;simo to cluster with.  However, even if the summaries
are mediocre, clustering <i> adds user value </i> to the unclustered,
long list of search results. 
</section>
</section>

<section  id="Company">
<section type="faq" id="Where did you come from?">


Viv&iacute;simo was founded by research computer scientists at the 
<A href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu"> Computer Science Department </A> at
Carnegie Mellon University, where research was originally done
under grants from the National Science Foundation.
<p/>
Our combined expertise is in artificial intelligence, information retrieval,
cognitive science, and pure mathematics.  Knowledge from all
these fields contributed to Viv&iacute;simo's interdisciplinary design.
<p/>
Carnegie Mellon released the intellectual property to Viv&iacute;simo's
founders so they could further develop it into a solid commercial
offering.  The company was founded in June, 2000.
</section>


<section type="faq" id="Where are you located?">


Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.
</section>


<section type="faq" id="Who were your outside investors?  ">


The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania through <A href="http://www.innovationworks.org">Innovation Works</A>, a regional
development company, has made several investments.  The <A href="http://www.nsf.gov">U.S. National Science Foundation</A> has
awarded two grants to Viv&iacute;simo.  <A href="http://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</A> retains a
financial interest.
</section>


<section type="faq" id="How do you gain revenue?">

Our web site is a free, uncluttered service to showcase our technology
and to help people search better.   Viv&iacute;simo is an enterprise software company
whose products bring similar benefits to corporations and government for internal use or to OEMs to enhance their
own text-intensive products and services.
</section>


<section type="faq" id="Can I use &V; with our own corporate search engine? On our own content?">


Viv&iacute;simo's document clustering can work with any search engine and its output can be
customized to match a client's look and feel.  If your search engine
is accessible over the internet, we may be able to set up a fully functional
demo: please describe your interest and send the URL to <A href="mailto:demos@vivisimo.com">demos@vivisimo.com</A>.
<P/>
If your content is not accessible over the internet, we may still be able to set
up a demo on a test file.  Please <A href="mailto:info@vivisimo.com">contact us</A> for details.
</section>


<section type="faq" id="Can I integrate Viv&iacute;simo's products in my own company's product or service?">


Viv&iacute;simo licenses its clustering technology to other companies
on an OEM basis to enhance their own product or service.  The
technology is easy to integrate, thanks to its clean <a ref="Is Viv&iacute;simo easy to integrate?">interfaces</a>.
</section>

<section type="faq" id="Are your products easy to integrate?">


Both the Clustering Engine (for clustering up to 500 search results) and the Enterprise Publisher 
(for off-line clustering of larger collections) are delivered as a C software library with an API; they run on a variety
of platforms (Windows, Solaris, Linux, and other Unix variants).  Both products can accept
XML, plain text, html or other parsable inputs.
</section>


<section type="faq" id="What does your software cost?">


Document clustering (e.g., of search results) has many varied uses.
The first step is to learn whether a prospective customer wants to
license the technology as an end-user or on an OEM basis.  The second
step is to identify how our software will or could be used within a
customer's business (we are able to suggest uses that a customer may
not yet see).  Then a pricing scheme is determined based on the
desired capabilities.  
</section>
</section>


<section  id="Web Search">
<section type="faq" id="How do I clear the search box history at Viv&iacute;simo.com?">
This feature relates to Internet Explorer and has nothing to do with &V; (you'll notice the same behavior
with other search engines). To clear it, follow this path in your IE menus:
<UL><LI>Tools > Internet Options > Content (Tab) > AutoComplete > Clear forms.</LI></UL>
</section>



<section type="faq" id="How can I copy the URL of the web page opened in the right frame?">
There are several ways:
<OL>
<LI> You can open the links in the full window or in a new window, 
getting the same behavior as with other search engines.</LI>
<LI>You can copy the URL from the link by right-clicking on it and selecting 
"Copy Shortcut" (IE) or "Copy Link Location" (Netscape).</LI>
<LI>You can re-open the page in a new window 
(see <a ref="How can I re-open the page currently opened in the right frame within a full window?"/>) 
and copy the URL from the address line.</LI>
<LI>You can click on <IMG SRC="/images/bookmark.gif"/> and copy the URL from the dialog box
 (see <a ref="How can I bookmark the page in the right frame?"/> for more details).</LI>
</OL>

</section>

<section type="faq" id="How can I open a search result in a full window?">


Click on the <font color="blue">[Open in Full Window]</font> or <font color="blue">[New Window]</font> link next to the title. Alternatively (Internet Explorer only), clicking on <font color="blue">[Preview]</font> allows you to preview a page directly inside the result list.
</section>


<section type="faq" id="How can I re-open the page currently opened in the right frame within a full window?">


Click on <IMG src="/images/fullwindow.gif"/> or <IMG src="/images/newwindow.gif"/> at the bottom right of your screen.  
Clicking on <IMG src="/images/newwindow.gif"/> will open the page in a new browser window while clicking
on <IMG src="/images/fullwindow.gif"/> will open the page in the current window. 
But note that the page opened is the one returned by &V; as a search result, which can differ
from the current page if you navigated previously
within the frame (Javascript security restrictions don't let
Viv&iacute;simo read the URL of a page on a foreign domain).
<P/>
To open the page on the right frame even after navigating, you can right click on it and select "Open Frame in New Window" in the menu. However, not all IE versions allow this, so you might have to download an update for your browser, e.g., <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/Windows/IE/WebAccess/ie5tools.asp">Web Accessories for Internet Explorer 5</A>.
<P/>
Alternatively, to view a page in the full window, IE users can
collapse and restore the left-side tree hierarchy by clicking on
<IMG SRC="../images/hide_top.gif"/>.
</section>


<section type="faq" id="How can I bookmark the page in the right frame?">


IE users can click on <IMG
SRC="/images/bookmark.gif"/> at the bottom right of your screen and select "OK".  Netscape users can copy paste the URL.
<P/>
Note that the bookmarked page can differ from the current page 
if you navigated previously within the frame (Javascript
security restrictions don't let Viv&iacute;simo read the URL of a page
on a foreign domain).
<P/>
If you did navigate, best is to bookmark the page by right-clicking on it and selecting "Add to Favorites..." (IE) or "Add
Bookmark" (Netscape).  
</section>


<section type="faq" id="Can I submit my site to Viv&iacute;simo.com?">


We don't crawl or index the web, so we have nowhere to put you!
</section>

<section type="faq" id="Can we advertise or promote our site on Vivisimo.com?">
Vivisimo.com is not a portal, but a corporate homepage.  The web
search capability is meant to showcase our technology, not to derive
revenue.  Hence, we do not accept advertisements nor paid listings.

</section>

<section type="faq" id='What is the "Search the results" form for (Internet Explorer only)?'>


It allows doing a string search (using regular expressions) inside the
title/description/URL of the search results.
<UL>
<LI>
In the right frame, documents that match your query will be highlighted
in red. Note that if you chose to hide the summaries or URLs, your
query won't be matched against them.</LI>
<LI>
In the left frame, folders that have documents matching your query will
be highlighted with a red +: <IMG align="bottom"
SRC="../images/pnodeR.gif"/>.  If "More" is highlighted with a red
arrow <IMG align="bottom" SRC="../images/downR.gif"/>, more matching
documents are in folders that you can access by clicking on the
"More".</LI>
</UL>
Netscape 4 users can use this functionality by clicking on <IMG src="/images/save.gif"/>.
</section>

<section type="faq" id="Can I save or email results?">
Yes, by clicking on <IMG src="/images/save.gif"/> at the lower right of your screen, a new page is loaded that contains all the data in one file which can be saved to disk or emailed from your browser. It seems that Netscape 4 does not save the page properly, so we recommend using another browser (IE on windows or the "lynx -source URL" command on Unix) to save it. Nevertheless, the page can be viewed with both IE5+ and Netscape4+.
</section>

<section type="faq" id="What syntax should I use for my queries on your demonstration search site?">


By default, our search service only returns documents containing <i>all</i> the terms you entered 
(i.e., this is equivalent to using <B>AND</B> or <B>+</B>). If you want <i>any</i> of the terms, 
separate them with <B>OR</B>. If you are looking for an exact phrase, surround it with quotes <B>" "</B>. 
To exclude a term, precede it with <B>-</B>.
<P/>
Our site supports the most advanced features of the major search engines using one syntax, which follows the most 
standard conventions.  Your query is translated into the corresponding syntax of each underlying search engine.
Our search service only queries the search engines that support your chosen syntax. 
(Check which engines have been queried by clicking on the Details link at the top of the results page.)
Thus, you can safely use <B>+</B>,<B>-</B>,... or common Boolean operators (<B>NEAR</B>,<B>OR</B>,...) 
as well as common field searches such as <B>image:</B>, <B>title:</B>, <B>link:</B>... or search restrictions 
such as <B>host:</B> or <B>domain:</B>. For details, visit the <a ref="syntax">Search Syntax</a> page.
</section>


<section type="faq" id="What are likely duplicates?">


Some search engines are easily spammed and so return multiple
copies of the same page with different URLs.  We try to correct this by removing pages with very similar descriptions.
</section>

<section type="faq" id="Why does Vivisimo.com return different results on the same query?">
We forward the query to various search engines and aggregate
the replies that come back quickly.  Due to the highly variable
response times on the web, the replies can differ from one search to
the next, and so the clustered output will differ too.
</section>

<section type="faq" id="What does the number next to a search engine name mean?">


This is the rank of a page for a given search engine. Note that some
search engines may return the same page several times. By clicking on
this number you can go directly to the search results contributed by that search
engine.
</section>

<section type="faq" id="Is &V;.com processing the full content of the web pages it shows?">  


No.  We could, but for web use we don't since we have not
previously seen or processed any of the pages (since Viv&iacute;simo.com
doesn't index the web). Accessing each page at query time would be too
slow.  We only make use of the contents (titles and brief
descriptions) that are returned by the underlying search engines.
</section>


<section type="faq" id="How do you rank the items on the right?">


At the highest hierarchical level, we preserve the ranking returned by
the search engine if only one search engine is called.  If multiple
search engines are called, then we favor pages returned by more than
one engine.
<p/>
At deeper levels in the hierarchy, we tend to rank higher those
pages that best fit the folder descriptions.
</section>


<section type="faq" id="Why doesn't Vivisimo.com cluster COMPANY's web search results?">

Some web search engines don't allow their search results to be re-processed by other software, which
is what our site does.  If your favorite search engine is missing from other site, this is the
likely explanation.
