# ARCHIVE
These are mostly test or test tools written for a Unix OS and its variants.  They are old so they  do
have defines for CRAY (Unicos) and SunOS in several of the programs.  Though most of them would
still be useful with minor modifications.  They have all be released to the public domain from the
company where they were written.  Many were written my me.  If you want them, feel free to "borrow"
them.

If you have questions, gawill1234@gmail.com.  Put "CRI tests" in the subject line.
